Accordingly, if CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of the note and security agreement, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of the seed cotton which is involved in the violation. If CCC or the county committee determines the producer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the first offense;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for the second offense; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Did not act in good faith about the violation, or for cases other than first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For first and second offenses, if CCC or the county committee determines that a producer acted in good faith when the violation occurred, the county committee shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan quantity affected by the violation, and charges plus interest applicable to the amount repaid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days from the date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense for which
