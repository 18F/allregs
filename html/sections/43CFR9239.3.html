                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reindeer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any use of the Federal lands for reindeer grazing  purposes, unless authorized by a valid permit issued in accordance with  the regulations in subpart 4132 of this chapter, is unlawful and is  prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person who willfully violates any of the rules and  regulations in subpart 4132 of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a  misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by  imprisonment for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than  $500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Livestock. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grazing livestock upon, allowing livestock to  drift and graze on, or driving livestock across lands that are subject  to lease or permit under the provisions of this part or within a stock  driveway, without a lease or other authorization from the Bureau of Land  Management, is prohibited and constitutes trespass. Trespassers will be  liable in damages to the United States for the forage consumed and for  injury to Federal property, and may be subject to civil and criminal  prosecution for such unlawful acts. A lessee who grazes livestock in  violation of the terms and conditions of his lease by exceeding numbers  specified, or by allowing the livestock to be on Federal land in an area  or at a time different from that designated in his lease shall be in  default and shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 4131.2-7 (g) and  (h) of this chapter. Under section 2 of the Act, any person who  willfully grazes livestock on public lands without authority, shall,  upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $500.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever it appears that a violation exists the authorized  officer shall serve written notice upon the alleged violator. The notice  shall set forth the act or omission constituting such violation and will  allow the party involved a reasonable specified time from receipt of  notice to demonstrate that there has been no violation or that he has  since achieved compliance. If the showing is satisfactory to the  authorized officer he will close the case. If satisfactory showing is  not made within the time allowed, the violation alleged in the notice  will be deemed to have been willful.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the owner of the trespassing livestock, or his  representative, is known, the authorized officer shall determine the  amount of the damage to the public land and other property of the United  States and shall make a demand for payment upon the alleged violator  setting forth the foregoing values including the value of the forage  consumed. Such forage value shall be computed at the commercial rates,  if susceptible to proof by reasonably available and reliable data;  otherwise, a minimum charge of $2 per animal unit month for trespass not  clearly willful will be made. Where the trespasses are repeated and/or  willful, a minimum charge of $4 per animal unit month for forage  consumed will be charged. All offers for settlement for value of forage  consumed and for damage to the public land or to other property of the  United States resulting from an alleged violation of any provision of  the act or regulations found   within Sec. 4131.0-3 et seq. of this chapter in the amount of $2,000 or  less may be accepted by the authorized officer. Offers for settlement in  excess of $2,000 will be transmitted to the State Director for  appropriate action. An offer of settlement will not constitute  satisfaction of civil liability for consumed forage and damage involved  until finally accepted by the authorized officer or the State Director,  and in no event will it relieve the violator of criminal liability. No  lease or permit will be issued or renewed until payment of any amount  found to be due the United States under this section has been offered.  [35 FR 9800, June 13, 1970.
