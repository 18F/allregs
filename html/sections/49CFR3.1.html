                            <p class="depth0">The official seal of the Department of Transportation is described  as follows: A white abstract triskelion figure signifying motion appears  within a circular blue field. The figure is symmetrical. The three  branches of the figure curve outward in a counter-clockwise direction,  each tapering almost to a point at the edge of the field. Surrounding  the blue circle is a circular ring of letters. The upper half of the  ring shows the words ``Department of Transportation''. The lower half of  the ring shows the words ``United States of America''. The letters may  be shown in either black or medium gray. The official seal of the  Department is modified when embossed. It appears below in black and  white. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02FE91.096</p>
