                            <p class="depth0">The Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, is a Federal statute of  general application which establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, and  child labor requirements that apply as provided in the Act. All  employees, whose employment has the relationship to interstate or  foreign commerce which the Act specifies, are subject to the prescribed  labor standards unless specifically exempt from them. Employers having  such employees are required to comply with the Act's provisions in this  regard unless relieved therefrom by some exemption in the Act. Such  employers are also required to comply with specified recordkeeping  requirements contained in part 516 of this chapter. The law authorizes  the Department of Labor to investigate for compliance and, in the event  of violations, to supervise the payment of unpaid wages or unpaid  overtime compensation owing to any employee. The law also provides for  enforcement in the courts.</p>
