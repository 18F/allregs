                            <p class="depth0">The characteristics of plant-incorporated protectants such as their production and use in plants, their biological properties, and their ability to spread and increase in quantity in the environment distinguish them from traditional chemical pesticides. Therefore, plant-incorporated protectants are subject to some different regulatory requirements and procedures than traditional chemical pesticides. This part sets forth regulatory requirements, criteria, and procedures applicable to plant-incorporated protectants under FIFRA and FFDCA. When applied to plant-incorporated

protectants, the definitions and regulations in this part supersede the regulations found in parts 150 through 180 of this chapter to the extent that the regulations conflict. Unless otherwise superseded by this part, the regulations in parts 150 through 180 of this chapter apply to plant-incorporated protectants.</p>
