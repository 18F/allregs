                            <p class="depth0">Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of the regulations in this part  preempts any State law, regulation, or order covering the same subject  matter, except an additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order  that is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local security  hazard; that is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the  United States Government; and that does not unreasonably burden  interstate commerce. For example, under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of  Sec.  1580.107 of this subpart preempts any State or tribal law, rule,  regulation, order or common law requirement covering the same subject  matter.</p>
