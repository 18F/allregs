                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In lieu of abandonment/destruction, you may donate such excess  personal property only to a public body without going through GSA. A  public body is any department, agency, special purpose district, or  other instrumentality of a state or local government; any Indian tribe;  or any agency of the federal government. If you become aware of an  interest from an eligible non-profit organization (see part 102-37 of  this chapter) that is not a public body in acquiring the property, you  must contact the regional GSA Personal Property Management office and  implement donation procedures in accordance with part 102-37 of this  chapter.
