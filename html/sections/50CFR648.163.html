                                Sec. 648.163  Bluefish Accountability Measures (AMs).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated based on a  single-year examination of total catch (landings and dead discards).  Both landings and dead discards will be evaluated in determining if the  ACL has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commercial sector EEZ closure. NMFS shall close the EEZ to  fishing for bluefish by commercial vessels for the remainder of the  calendar year by publishing notification in the Federal Register if the  Regional Administrator determines that the inaction of one or more  states will cause the ACL specified in Sec. 648.160(a) to be exceeded,  or if the commercial fisheries in all states have been closed. NMFS may  reopen the EEZ if earlier inaction by a state has been remedied by that  state, or if commercial fisheries in one or more states have been  reopened without causing the ACL to be exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State commercial landing quotas. The Regional Administrator will  monitor state commercial quotas based on dealer reports and other  available information and shall determine the date when a state  commercial quota will be harvested. NMFS shall publish notification in  the Federal Register advising a state that, effective upon a specific  date, its commercial quota has been harvested and notifying vessel and  dealer permit holders that no commercial quota is available for landing  bluefish in that state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial landings overage repayment. All bluefish landed for  sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual commercial  quota, regardless of where the bluefish were harvested. Any overages of  the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that  state's annual quota for the following year, irrespective of whether the  fishery-level ACL is exceeded. If a state has increased or reduced quota  through the transfer process described in Sec. 648.162, then any overage  will be measured against that state's final adjusted quota.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is a quota overage at the end of the fishing year among  states involved in the combination of quotas, the overage will be  deducted from the following year's quota for each of the states involved  in the combined quota, irrespective of whether the fishery-level ACL is  exceeded. The deduction will be proportional, based on each state's  relative share of the combined quota for the previous year. A transfer  of quota or combination of quotas does not alter any state's percentage  share of the overall quota specified in Sec. 648.162(d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recreational landings AM when the ACL is exceeded and no sector- to-sector transfer of allowable landings has occurred. If the fishery- level ACL is exceeded and landings from the recreational fishery are  determined to be the sole cause of the overage, and no transfer between  the commercial and recreational sector was made for the fishing year, as  outlined in Sec. 648.162(b)(2), then the following procedure will be  followed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If biomass is below the threshold, the stock is under  rebuilding, or biological reference points are unknown. If the most  recent estimate of biomass is below the BMSY threshold (i.e.,  B/BMSY is less than 0.5), the stock is under a rebuilding  plan, or the biological reference points (B or BMSY) are  unknown, and the ACL   has been exceeded, then the exact amount, in pounds, by which the most  recent year's recreational catch estimate exceeded the most recent  year's ACL will be deducted from the following year's recreational ACT,  or as soon as possible thereafter, once catch data are available, as a  single-year adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If biomass is above the threshold, but below the target, and the  stock is not under rebuilding. If the most recent estimate of biomass is  above the biomass threshold (B/BMSY is greater than 0.5), but  below the biomass target (B/BMSY is less than 1.0), and the  stock is not under a rebuilding plan, then the following AMs will apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the ACL has been exceeded. If the ACL has been exceeded, then  adjustments to the recreational management measures, taking into account  the performance of the measures and conditions that precipitated the  overage, will be made in the following fishing year, or as soon as  possible thereafter, once catch data are available, as a single-year  adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> of this section. In addition, adjustments to the  recreational management measures, taking into account the performance of  the measures and conditions that precipitated the overage, will be made  in the following year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Adjustment to Recreational ACT. If an adjustment to the  following year's Recreational ACT is required, then the ACT will be  reduced by the exact amount, in pounds, of the product of the  recreational overage, defined as the difference between the recreational  contribution to the catch above the ACL, and the payback coefficient, as  specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Payback coefficient. The payback coefficient is the difference  between the most recent estimates of BMSY and biomass (i.e.,  BMSY-B) divided by one-half of BMSY.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If biomass is above BMSY. If the most recent estimate of biomass  is above BMSY (i.e., B/BMSY is greater than 1.0),  then adjustments to the recreational management measures, taking into  account the performance of the measures and conditions that precipitated  the overage, will be made in the following fishing year, or as soon as  possible thereafter, once catch data are available, as a single-year  adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> AM for when the ACL is exceeded and a sector-to-sector transfer  of allowable landings has occurred. If the fishery-level ACL is exceeded  and landings from the recreational fishery and/or the commercial fishery  are determined to have caused the overage, and a transfer between the  commercial and recreational sector has occurred for the fishing year, as  outlined in Sec. 648.162(b)(2), then the amount transferred between the  recreational and commercial sectors may be reduced by the ACL overage  amount (pound-for-pound repayment) in a subsequent, single fishing year  if the Bluefish Monitoring Committee determines that the ACL overage was  the result of too liberal a landings transfer between the two sectors.  If the Bluefish Monitoring Committee determines that the ACL overage was  not the result of the landings transfer, the recreational AMs described  in paragraph (d) of this section will be implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Non-landing AMs. In the event that the ACL has been exceeded and  the overage has not been accommodated through the AM measures in  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, then the exact amount, in  pounds, by which the ACL was exceeded shall be deducted, as soon as  possible, from a subsequent, single fishing year ACL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> State/Federal disconnect AM. If the total catch, allowable  landings, commercial quotas, and/or recreational harvest limit measures  adopted by the ASMFC Bluefish Management Board and the MAFMC differ for  a given fishing year, administrative action will be taken as soon as is  practicable to revisit the respective recommendations of the two groups.  The intent of this action shall be to achieve alignment through  consistent state and Federal measures so no differential effects occur  to Federal permit holders.
