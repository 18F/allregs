An employee shall not provide service for compensation, in  any capacity, to an FDIC-insured depository institution or an employee  or person employed by or connected with such institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of professional licenses. A covered employee who holds a  license related to real estate, appraisals, securities, or insurance and  whose official duties with the Corporation require personal and  substantial involvement in matters related to, respectively, real  estate, appraisal, securities, or insurance is prohibited from using  such license, other than in the performance of his or her official  duties, for the production of income. The appropriate director, in  consultation with an agency designee, may grant exceptions to this  prohibition based on a finding that the specific transactions which  require use   of the license will not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or  use of public office for private gain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility to consult with agency designee. An employee who  engages in, or intends to engage in, any outside employment or other  activity that may require disqualification from the employee's official  duties shall consult with an agency designee prior to engaging in or  continuing to engage in the activity.</p>
