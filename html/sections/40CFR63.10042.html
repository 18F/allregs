General Provisions</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. These monitoring provisions apply to the measurement of total vapor phase mercury (Hg) in emissions from electric utility steam generating units, using either a mercury continuous emission monitoring system (Hg CEMS) or a sorbent trap monitoring system. The Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system must be capable of measuring the total vapor phase mercury in units of the applicable emissions standard (e.g., lb/TBtu or lb/GWh), regardless of speciation.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Initial Certification and Recertification Procedures. The owner or operator of an affected unit that uses a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system together with other necessary monitoring components to account for Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard shall comply with the initial certification and recertification procedures in section 4 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Requirements. The owner or operator of an affected unit that uses a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system together with other necessary monitoring components to account for Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in section 5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Missing Data Procedures. The owner or operator of an affected unit is not required to substitute for missing data from Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems. Any process operating hour for which quality-assured Hg concentration data are not obtained is counted as an hour of monitoring system downtime.</p><p class="depth0">2. Monitoring of Hg Emissions</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Monitoring System Installation Requirements. Flue gases from the affected units under this subpart vent to the atmosphere through a variety of exhaust configurations including single stacks, common stack configurations, and multiple stack configurations. For each of these configurations, Sec. 63.10010(a) specifies the appropriate location(s) at which to install continuous monitoring systems (CMS). These CMS installation provisions apply to the Hg CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring systems, and other continuous monitoring systems that provide data for the Hg emissions calculations in section 6.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems. In the electronic monitoring plan described in section 7.1.1.2.1 of this appendix, you must designate a primary Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system. The primary system must be used to report hourly Hg concentration values when the system is able to provide quality-assured data, i.e., when the system is ``in control''. However, to increase data availability in the event of a primary monitoring system outage, you may install, operate, maintain, and calibrate backup monitoring systems, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Redundant Backup Systems. A redundant backup monitoring system may be either a separate Hg CEMS with its own probe, sample interface, and analyzer, or a separate sorbent trap monitoring system. A redundant backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack location, and is kept on ``hot standby'' in case the primary monitoring system is unable to provide quality-assured data. A redundant backup system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Each redundant backup monitoring system must be certified according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this appendix and must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in section 5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems. A non-redundant backup monitoring system is a separate Hg CEMS or sorbent trap system that has been certified at a particular unit or stack location, but is not permanently installed at that location. Rather, the system is kept on ``cold standby'' and may be reinstalled in the event of a primary monitoring system outage. A non-redundant backup monitoring system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Non-redundant backup Hg CEMS must complete the same certification tests as the primary monitoring system, with one exception. The 7-day calibration error test is not required for a non-redundant backup Hg CEMS. Except as otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a non-redundant backup monitoring system may only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers. When a primary Hg analyzer needs repair or maintenance, you may temporarily install a like-kind replacement analyzer, to minimize data loss. Except as otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a temporary like-kind replacement analyzer may only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location. The analyzer must be represented as a component of the primary Hg CEMS, and must be assigned a 3-character component ID number, beginning with the prefix ``LK''.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4 Quality Assurance Requirements for Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems and Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers. To quality-assure the data from non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems and

temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzers, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.1 When a certified non-redundant backup sorbent trap monitoring system is brought into service, you must follow the procedures for routine day-to-day operation of the system, in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.2 When a certified non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or a temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer is brought into service, a calibration error test and a linearity check must be performed and passed. A single point system integrity check is also required, unless a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg was used for the calibration error test.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.3 Each non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer shall comply with all required daily, weekly, and quarterly quality-assurance test requirements in section 5 of this appendix, for as long as the system or analyzer remains in service.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.4 For the routine, on-going quality-assurance of a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system, a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) must be performed and passed at least once every 8 calendar quarters at the unit or stack location(s) where the system will be used.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.5 To use a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system or a temporary like-kind replacement analyzer for more than 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location, a RATA must first be performed and passed at that location.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mercury Emissions Measurement Methods</p><p class="depth0">The following definitions, equipment specifications, procedures, and performance criteria are applicable to the measurement of vapor-phase Hg emissions from electric utility steam generating units, under relatively low-dust conditions (i.e., sampling in the stack or duct after all pollution control devices). The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor-phase Hg in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg0, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized forms of Hg.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System or Hg CEMS means all of the equipment used to continuously determine the total vapor phase Hg concentration. The measurement system may include the following major subsystems: sample acquisition, Hg+2 to Hg0 converter, sample transport, sample conditioning, flow control/gas manifold, gas analyzer, and data acquisition and handling system (DAHS). Hg CEMS may be nominally real-time or time-integrated, batch sampling systems that sample the gas on an intermittent basis and concentrate on a collection medium before intermittent analysis and reporting.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System means the equipment required to monitor Hg emissions continuously by using paired sorbent traps containing iodated charcoal (IC) or other suitable sorbent medium. The monitoring system consists of a probe, paired sorbent traps, an umbilical line, moisture removal components, an airtight sample pump, a gas flow meter, and an automated data acquisition and handling system. The system samples the stack gas at a constant proportional rate relative to the stack gas volumetric flow rate. The sampling is a batch process. The average Hg concentration in the stack gas for the sampling period is determined, in units of micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (g/dscm), based on the sample volume measured by the gas flow meter and the mass of Hg collected in the sorbent traps.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.3 NIST means the National Institute of Standards and Technology, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.4 NIST-Traceable Elemental Hg Standards means either: compressed gas cylinders having known concentrations of elemental Hg, which have been prepared according to the ``EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards''; or calibration gases having known concentrations of elemental Hg, produced by a generator that meets the performance requirements of the ``EPA Traceability Protocol for Qualification and Certification of Elemental Mercury Gas Generators'' or an interim version of that protocol.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.5 NIST-Traceable Source of Oxidized Hg means a generator that is capable of providing known concentrations of vapor phase mercuric chloride (HgCl2), and that meets the performance requirements of the ``EPA Traceability Protocol for Qualification and Certification of Mercuric Chloride Gas Generators'' or an interim version of that protocol.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.6 Calibration Gas means a NIST-traceable gas standard containing a known concentration of elemental or oxidized Hg that is produced and certified in accordance with an EPA traceability protocol.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.7 Span Value means a conservatively high estimate of the Hg concentrations to be measured by a CEMS. The span value of a Hg CEMS should be set to approximately twice the concentration corresponding to the emission standard, rounded off as appropriate (see section 3.2.1.4.2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">3.1.8 Zero-Level Gas means calibration gas containing a Hg concentration that is below the level detectable by the Hg gas analyzer in use.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.9 Low-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration that is 20 to 30 percent of the span value.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.10 Mid-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration that is 50 to 60 percent of the span value.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.11 High-Level Gas means calibration gas with a concentration that is 80 to 100 percent of the span value.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.12 Calibration Error Test means a test designed to assess the ability of a Hg CEMS to measure the concentrations of calibration gases accurately. A zero-level gas and an upscale gas are required for this test. For the upscale gas, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas may be used, and the gas may either be an elemental or oxidized Hg standard.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.13 Linearity Check means a test designed to determine whether the response of a Hg analyzer is linear across its measurement range. Three elemental Hg calibration gas standards (i.e., low, mid, and high-level gases) are required for this test.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.14 System Integrity Check means a test designed to assess the transport and measurement of oxidized Hg by a Hg CEMS. Oxidized Hg standards are used for this test. For a three-level system integrity check, low, mid, and high-level calibration gases are required. For a single-level check, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas may be used.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.15 Cycle Time Test means a test designed to measure the amount of time it takes for a Hg CEMS, while operating normally, to respond to a known step change in gas concentration. For this test, a zero gas and a high-level gas are required. The high-level gas may be either an elemental or an oxidized Hg standard.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.16 Relative Accuracy Test Audit or RATA means a series of nine or more test runs, directly comparing readings from a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to measurements made with a reference stack test method. The relative accuracy (RA) of the monitoring system is expressed as the absolute mean difference between the monitoring system and reference method measurements plus the absolute value of the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient, divided by the mean value of the reference method measurements.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.17 Unit Operating Hour means a clock hour in which a unit combusts any fuel, either for part of the hour or for the entire hour.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.18 Stack Operating Hour means a clock hour in which gases flow through a particular monitored stack or duct (either for part of the hour or for the entire hour), while the associated unit(s) are combusting fuel.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.19 Operating Day means a calendar day in which a source combusts any fuel.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.20 Quality Assurance (QA) Operating Quarter means a calendar quarter in which there are at least 168 unit or stack operating hours (as defined in this section).</p><p class="depth0">3.1.21 Grace Period means a specified number of unit or stack operating hours after the deadline for a required quality-assurance test of a continuous monitor has passed, in which the test may be performed and passed without loss of data.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Continuous Monitoring Methods.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 Hg CEMS. A typical Hg CEMS is shown in Figure A-1. The CEMS in Figure A-1 is a dilution extractive system, which measures Hg concentration on a wet basis, and is the most commonly-used type of Hg CEMS. Other system designs may be used, provided that the CEMS meets the performance specifications in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE12.012</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1 Equipment Specifications.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.1 Materials of Construction. All wetted sampling system components, including probe components prior to the point at which the calibration gas is introduced, must be chemically inert to all Hg species. Materials such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) Teflon\TM\, quartz, and treated stainless steel (SS) are examples of such materials.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.2 Temperature Considerations. All system components prior to the Hg+2 to Hg\0\ converter must be maintained at a sample temperature above the acid gas dew point.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3 Measurement System Components.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.1 Sample Probe. The probe must be made of the appropriate materials as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section, heated when necessary, as described in paragraph 3.2.1.1.3.4 of this section, and configured with ports for introduction of calibration gases.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.2 Filter or Other Particulate Removal Device. The filter or other particulate removal device is part of the measurement system, must be made of appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section, and must be included in all system tests.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.3 Sample Line. The sample line that connects the probe to the converter, conditioning system, and analyzer must be made of appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.4 Conditioning Equipment. For wet basis systems, such as the one shown in Figure A-1, the sample must be kept above its dew point either by: heating the sample line and all sample transport components up to the inlet of the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, also heating the analyzer); or diluting the sample prior to analysis using a dilution probe system. The components required for these operations are considered to be conditioning equipment. For dry basis measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to remove moisture continuously from the sample gas, and any equipment needed to heat the probe or sample line to avoid condensation prior to the moisture removal component is also required.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.5 Sampling Pump. A pump is needed to push or pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. If a mechanical sample pump is used and its surfaces are in contact with the sample gas prior to detection, the pump must be leak free and must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled (see paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section). For dilution-type measurement systems, such as the system shown in Figure A-1, an ejector pump (eductor) may be used to create a sufficient vacuum that sample gas will be drawn through a critical orifice at a constant rate. The ejector pump must be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.6 Calibration Gas System(s). Design and equip each Hg CEMS to permit the introduction of known concentrations of elemental Hg and HgCl2 separately, at a point

preceding the sample extraction filtration system, such that the entire measurement system can be checked. The calibration gas system(s) must be designed so that the flow rate exceeds the sampling system flow requirements and that the gas is delivered to the CEMS at atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.7 Sample Gas Delivery. The sample line may feed directly to either a converter, a by-pass valve (for Hg speciating systems), or a sample manifold. All valve and/or manifold components must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled and the calibration gas, and must be configured to safely discharge any excess gas.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.8 Hg Analyzer. An instrument is required that continuously measures the total vapor phase Hg concentration in the gas stream. The analyzer may also be capable of measuring elemental and oxidized Hg separately.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1.3.9 Data Recorder. A recorder, such as a computerized data acquisition and handling system (DAHS), digital recorder, or data logger, is required for recording measurement data.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2 Reagents and Standards.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.1 NIST Traceability. Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable calibration gas standards and reagents (as defined in paragraphs 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of this section) shall be used for the tests and procedures required under this subpart. Calibration gases with known concentrations of Hg0 and HgCl2 are required. Special reagents and equipment may be needed to prepare the Hg0 and HgCl2 gas standards (e.g., NIST-traceable solutions of HgCl2 and gas generators equipped with mass flow controllers).</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.2 Required Calibration Gas Concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.2.1 Zero-Level Gas. A zero-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration below the level detectable by the Hg analyzer is required for calibration error tests and cycle time tests of the CEMS.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.2.2 Low-Level Gas. A low-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 20 to 30 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks and 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks and oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.2.3 Mid-Level Gas. A mid-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 50 to 60 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks and for 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS, and is optional for calibration error tests and single-level system integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be used for the calibration error tests.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2.2.4 High-Level Gas. A high-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 80 to 100 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks, 3-level system integrity checks, and cycle time tests of the CEMS, and is optional for calibration error tests and single-level system integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be used for the calibration error and cycle time tests.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.3 Installation and Measurement Location. For the Hg CEMS and any additional monitoring system(s) needed to convert Hg concentrations to the desired units of measure (i.e., a flow monitor, CO2 or O2 monitor, and/or moisture monitor, as applicable), install each monitoring system at a location: that is consistent with 63.10010(a); that represents the emissions exiting to the atmosphere; and where it is likely that the CEMS can pass the relative accuracy test.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.4 Monitor Span and Range Requirements. Determine the appropriate span and range value(s) for the Hg CEMS as described in paragraphs 3.2.1.4.1 through 3.2.1.4.3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.4.1 Maximum Potential Concentration. There are three options for determining the maximum potential Hg concentration (MPC). Option 1 applies to coal combustion. You may use a default value of 10 g/scm for all coal ranks (including coal refuse) except for lignite; for lignite, use 16 g/scm. If different coals are blended as part of normal operation, use the highest MPC for any fuel in the blend. Option 2 is to base the MPC on the results of site-specific Hg emission testing. This option may be used only if the unit does not have add-on Hg emission controls or a flue gas desulfurization system, or if testing is performed upstream of all emission control devices. If Option 2 is selected, perform at least three test runs at the normal operating load, and the highest Hg concentration obtained in any of the tests shall be the MPC. Option 3 is to use fuel sampling and analysis to estimate the MPC. To make this estimate, use the average Hg content (i.e., the weight percentage) from at least three representative fuel samples, together with other available information, including, but not limited to the maximum fuel feed rate, the heating value of the fuel, and an appropriate F-factor. Assume that all of the Hg in the fuel is emitted to the atmosphere as vapor-phase Hg.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.4.2 Span Value. To determine the span value of the Hg CEMS, multiply the Hg concentration corresponding to the applicable emissions standard by two. If the result of this calculation is an exact multiple of 10 g/scm, use the result as the span value. Otherwise, round off the result to either: the

next highest integer; the next highest multiple of 5 g/scm; or the next highest multiple of 10 g/scm.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.4.3 Analyzer Range. The Hg analyzer must be capable of reading Hg concentration as high as the MPC.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System. A sorbent trap monitoring system (as defined in paragraph 3.1.2 of this section) may be used as an alternative to a Hg CEMS. If this option is selected, the monitoring system shall be installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. The system shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of section 4.1.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3 Other Necessary Data Collection. To convert measured hourly Hg concentrations to the units of the applicable emissions standard (i.e., lb/TBtu or lb/GWh), additional data must be collected, as described in paragraphs 3.2.3.1 through 3.2.3.3 of this section. Any additional monitoring systems needed for this purpose must be certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured according to the applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter (see Secs. 63.10010(b) through (d)). The calculation methods for the types of emission limits described in paragraphs 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2 of this section are presented in section 6.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3.1 Heat Input-Based Emission Limits. For a heat input-based Hg emission limit (i.e., in lb/TBtu), data from a certified CO2 or O2 monitor are needed, along with a fuel-specific F-factor and a conversion constant to convert measured Hg concentration values to the units of the standard. In some cases, the stack gas moisture content must also be considered in making these conversions.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3.2 Electrical Output-Based Emission Rates. If the applicable Hg limit is electrical output-based (i.e., lb/GWh), hourly electrical load data and unit operating times are required in addition to hourly data from a certified stack gas flow rate monitor and (if applicable) moisture data.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3.3 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Operation. Routine operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system requires the use of a certified stack gas flow rate monitor, to maintain an established ratio of stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Certification and Recertification Requirements</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Certification Requirements. All Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems and the additional monitoring systems used to continuously measure Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard in accordance with this appendix must be certified in a timely manner, such that the initial compliance demonstration is completed no later than the applicable date in Sec. 63.9984(f).</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 Hg CEMS. Table A-1, below, summarizes the certification test requirements and performance specifications for a Hg CEMS. The CEMS may not be used to report quality-assured data until these performance criteria are met. Paragraphs 4.1.1.1 through 4.1.1.5 of this section provide specific instructions for the required tests. All tests must be performed with the affected unit(s) operating (i.e., combusting fuel). Except for the RATA, which must be performed at normal load, no particular load level is required for the certification tests.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1.1 7-Day Calibration Error Test. Perform the 7-day calibration error test on 7 consecutive source operating days, using a zero-level gas and either a high-level or a mid-level calibration gas standard (as defined in sections 3.1.8, 3.1.10, and 3.1.11 of this appendix). Either elemental or oxidized NIST-traceable Hg standards (as defined in sections 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of this appendix) may be used for the test. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Operate the Hg CEMS in its normal sampling mode during the test. The calibrations should be approximately 24 hours apart, unless the 7-day test is performed over nonconsecutive calendar days. On each day of the test, inject the zero-level and upscale gases in sequence and record the analyzer responses. Pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. Do not make any manual adjustments to the monitor (i.e., resetting the calibration) until after taking measurements at both the zero and upscale concentration levels. If automatic adjustments are made following both injections, conduct the calibration error test such that the magnitude of the adjustments can be determined, and use only the unadjusted analyzer responses in the calculations. Calculate the calibration error (CE) on each day of the test, as described in Table A-1. The CE on each day of the test must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1.2 Linearity Check. Perform the linearity check using low, mid, and high-level concentrations of NIST-traceable elemental Hg standards. Three gas injections at each concentration level are required, with no two successive injections at the same concentration level. Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port, as specified in section 3.2.1.1.3.6 of this appendix. Operate the CEMS at its normal operating temperature and conditions. Pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other components used during normal sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe

as is practical. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and handling system for each gas injection. At each concentration level, use the average analyzer response to calculate the linearity error (LE), as described in Table A-1. The LE must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1.3 Three-Level System Integrity Check. Perform the 3-level system integrity check using low, mid, and high-level calibration gas concentrations generated by a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg. Follow the same basic procedure as for the linearity check. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Calculate the system integrity error (SIE), as described in Table A-1. The SIE must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.

The arithmetic difference between RMavg and Cavg can be either + or -.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1.4 Cycle Time Test. Perform the cycle time test, using a zero-level gas and a high-level calibration gas.</p><p class="depth0">Either an elemental or oxidized NIST-traceable Hg standard may be used as the high-level gas. Perform the test in two stages--upscale and downscale. The slower of the upscale and downscale response times is the cycle time for the CEMS. Begin each stage of the test by injecting calibration gas after achieving a stable reading of the stack emissions. The cycle time is the amount of time it takes for the analyzer to register a reading that is 95 percent of the way between the stable stack emissions reading and the final, stable reading of the calibration gas concentration. Use the following criterion to determine when a stable reading of stack emissions or calibration gas has been attained--the reading is stable if it changes by no more than 2.0 percent of the span value or 0.5 g/scm (whichever is less restrictive) for two minutes, or a reading with a change of less than 6.0 percent from the measured average concentration over 6 minutes. Integrated batch sampling type Hg CEMS are exempted from this test; however, these systems must be capable of delivering a measured Hg concentration reading at least once every 15 minutes. If necessary to increase measurement sensitivity of a batch sampling type Hg CEMS for a specific application, you may petition the Administrator for approval of a time longer than 15 minutes between readings.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1.5 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). Perform the RATA of the Hg CEMS at normal load. Acceptable Hg reference methods for the RATA include ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008), ``Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14) and Methods 29, 30A, and 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60. When Method 29 or

ASTM D6784-02 is used, paired sampling trains are required. To validate a Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 test run, calculate the relative deviation (RD) using Equation A-1 of this section, and assess the results as follows to validate the run. The RD must not exceed 10 percent, when the average Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 g/dscm. If the average concentration is 41.0 g/dscm, the RD must not exceed 20 percent. The RD results are also acceptable if the absolute difference between the two Hg concentrations does not exceed 0.2 g/dscm. If the RD specification is met, the results of the two samples shall be averaged arithmetically.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE12.013

A minimum of nine valid test runs must be performed, directly comparing the CEMS measurements to the reference method. More than nine test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, the results from a maximum of three test runs may be rejected so long as the total number of test results used to determine the relative accuracy is greater than or equal to nine; however, all data must be reported including the rejected data. The minimum time per run is 21 minutes if Method 30A is used.

Ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) and Data Validation</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Hg CEMS.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Required QA Tests. Periodic QA testing of each Hg CEMS is required following initial certification. The required QA tests, the test frequencies, and the performance specifications that must be met are summarized in Table A-2, below. All tests must be performed with the affected unit(s) operating (i.e., combusting fuel). Except for the RATA, which must be performed at normal load, no particular load level is required for the tests. For each test, follow the same basic procedures in section 4.1.1 of this appendix that were used for initial certification.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Test Frequency. The frequency for the required QA tests of the Hg CEMS shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.1 Calibration error tests of the Hg CEMS are required daily, except during unit outages. Use either NIST-traceable elemental Hg standards or NIST-traceable oxidized Hg standards for these calibrations. Both a zero-level gas and either a mid-level or high-level gas are required for these calibrations.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.2 Perform a linearity check of the Hg CEMS in each QA operating quarter, using low-level, mid-level, and high-level NIST-traceable elemental Hg standards. For units that operate infrequently, limited exemptions from this test are allowed for ``non-QA operating quarters''. A maximum of three consecutive exemptions for this reason are permitted, following the quarter of the last test. After the third consecutive exemption, a linearity check must be performed in the next calendar quarter or within a grace period of 168 unit or stack operating hours after the end of that quarter. The test frequency for 3-level system integrity checks (if performed in lieu of linearity checks) is the same as for the linearity checks. Use low-level, mid-level, and high-level NIST-traceable oxidized Hg standards for the system integrity checks.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.3 If required, perform a single-level system integrity check weekly, i.e., once every 7 operating days (see the third column in Table A-2).</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.4 The test frequency for the RATAs of the Hg CEMS shall be annual, i.e., once every four QA operating quarters. For units that operate infrequently, extensions of RATA deadlines are allowed for non-QA operating quarters. Following a RATA, if there is a subsequent non-QA quarter, it extends the deadline for the next test by one calendar quarter. However, there is a limit to these extensions; the deadline may not be extended beyond the end of the eighth calendar quarter after the quarter of the last test. At that point, a RATA must either be performed within the eighth calendar quarter or in a 720 hour unit or stack operating hour grace period following that quarter. When a required annual RATA is done within a grace period, the deadline for the next RATA is three QA operating quarters after the quarter in which the grace period test is performed.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3 Grace Periods.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3.1 A 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for quarterly linearity checks and 3-level system integrity checks of the Hg CEMS.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3.2 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for RATAs of the Hg CEMS.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3.3 There is no grace period for weekly system integrity checks.

The Hg CEMS is considered to be out-of-control, and data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, when any one of the acceptance criteria for the required QA tests in Table A-2 is not met. The CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. To end an out-of-control period, the QA test that was either failed or not done on time must be performed and

passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as hours of monitoring system downtime.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.5 Conditional Data Validation. For certification, recertification, and diagnostic testing of Hg monitoring systems, and for the required QA tests when non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems or temporary like-kind Hg analyzers are brought into service, the conditional data validation provisions in Secs. 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data loss. The allotted window of time to complete 7-day calibration error tests, linearity checks, cycle time tests, and RATAs shall be as specified in Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter.
