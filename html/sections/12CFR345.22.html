If consumer lending constitutes a substantial majority of a bank's business,

the FDIC will evaluate the bank's consumer lending in one or more of the following categories: motor vehicle, credit card, home equity, other secured, and other unsecured loans. In addition, at a bank's option, the FDIC will evaluate one or more categories of consumer lending, if the bank has collected and maintained, as required in Sec. 345.42(c)(1), the data for each category that the bank elects to have the FDIC evaluate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lending test evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a bank's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and community development lending.
