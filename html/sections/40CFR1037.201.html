                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must send us a separate application for a certificate of  conformity for each vehicle family. A certificate of conformity is valid  from the indicated effective date until the end of the model year for  which it is issued, which may not extend beyond December 31 of that  year. You must renew your certification annually for any vehicles you  continue to produce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application must contain all the information required by  this part and must not include false or incomplete statements or  information (see Sec.  1037.255).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask you to include less information than we specify in  this subpart, as long as you maintain all the information required by  Sec.  1037.250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related  to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An authorized representative of your company must approve and  sign the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> See Sec.  1037.255 for provisions describing how we will process  your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We may perform confirmatory testing on your vehicles; for  example, we may test vehicles to verify drag areas or other GEM inputs.  This includes vehicles used to determine Falt-aero under  Sec.  1037.521. We may require you to deliver your test vehicles to a  facility we designate for our testing. Alternatively, you may choose to  deliver another vehicle that is identical in all material respects to  the test vehicle. Where certification is based on testing components  such as tires, we may require you to deliver test components to a  facility we designate for our testing.
