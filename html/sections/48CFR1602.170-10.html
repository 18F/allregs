                            <p class="depth0">Letter of credit means the method by which certain carriers, and their underwriters if authorized, receive recurring premium payments and contingency reserve payments by drawing against a commitment (certified by a responsible OPM official) which specifies a dollar amount available. For each carrier participating in the letter of credit arrangement for payment under this part, the terms ``carrier reserves,'' and ``special reserves'' include any balance in the carrier's letter of credit account.
