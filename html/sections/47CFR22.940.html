                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular  renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal  proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in  the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve  the public interest, convenience and necessity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to  be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major  preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal  proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record for the  relevant license period demonstrates that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service  during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as  service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of  mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with  applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as  amended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a  cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding  must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal  expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of its current service in terms of geographic  coverage and population served, as well as the system's ability to  accommodate the needs of roamers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of its record of expansion, including a  timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet changes in  demand for cellular service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of its investments in its cellular system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated  the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any  pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a  renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification  applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal  application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification  application is dismissed or denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional comparative issues. The following additional  comparative issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal  proceedings, if a full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to  Sec. 22.935(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and  population that each applicant proposes to serve; to determine and  compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and  to determine and compare the ability of each applicant's cellular system  to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal  for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated manner in order to  meet anticipated increasing demand for both local and roamer service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the  service proposed by each applicant, including each applicant's proposed  rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications,  regulations and facilities (including switching capabilities); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past  performance in the cellular industry or another business of comparable  type and size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional showings for competing applications. With respect to  evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any  applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal  application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering  any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must  demonstrate that there is demand for that new service and also present a  business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the  system economically. Any competing applicant who proposes to replace  analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its  proposal unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate  its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive  service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented  cellular technology.</p>
