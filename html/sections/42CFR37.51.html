                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each chest radiograph obtained at an approved facility using  a digital radiography system, a qualified and licensed physician who  reads chest radiographs in the normal course of practice must provide an  initial clinical interpretation and notification, as specified in Sec.   37.54, of any significant abnormal findings other than pneumoconiosis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, in classifying the pneumoconioses in a manner consistent with  the Guidelines for the Use of the ILO International Classification of  Radiographs of Pneumoconioses (incorporated by reference, see Sec.   37.10). Chest radiograph interpretations and classifications must be  recorded on a paper or electronic Chest Radiograph Classification Form  (Form CDC/NIOSH (M)2.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All interpreters, whenever classifying digitally-acquired chest  radiographs made under the Act, must have immediately available for  reference a complete set of NIOSH-approved standard digital chest  radiographic images provided for use with the Guidelines for the Use of  the ILO International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses  (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10). Only NIOSH-approved  standard digital images may be used for classifying digital chest images  for pneumoconiosis. Modification of the appearance of the standard  images using software tools is not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Viewing systems should enable readers to display the coal  miner's chest image at the full resolution of the image acquisition  system, side-by-side with the selected NIOSH-approved standard images  for comparison.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Image display devices must be flat panel monitors displaying  at least 3 MP at 10 bit depth. Image displays and associated graphics  cards must meet the calibration and other specifications of the Digital  Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard PS 3.14-2011  (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Image displays and associated graphics cards must not deviate  by more than 10 percent from the grayscale standard display function  (GSDF) when assessed according to the AAPM On-Line Report No. 03, pages  1-146 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display system luminance (maximum and ratio), relative noise,  linearity, modulation transfer function (MTF), frequency, and glare  should meet or exceed recommendations listed in AAPM On-Line Report No.  03, pages 1-146 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10). Viewing  displays must have a maximum luminance of at least 171 cd/m\2\, a ratio  of maximum luminance to minimum luminance of at least 250, and a glare  ratio greater than 400. The contribution of ambient light reflected from  the display surface, after light sources have been minimized, must be  included in luminance measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Displays must be situated so as to minimize front surface glare.  Readers must minimize reflected light from ambient sources during the  performance of classifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Measurements of the width and length of pleural shadows and the  diameter of opacities must be taken using calibrated software measuring  tools. If permitted by the viewing software, a record must be made of  the presentation state(s), including any noise reduction and edge  enhancement or restoration functions that were used in performing the  classification, including any annotations and measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Quality control procedures for devices used to display chest  images for classification must comply with the recommendations of the  American Association of Physicists in Medicine AAPM On-Line Report No.  03, pages 1-146 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If automatic quality assurance systems are used, visual  inspection must be performed using one or more test patterns recommended  by the medical physicist every 6 months, or more frequently, to check  for defects that automatic systems may not detect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Classification of CR and DR digitally-acquired chest radiographs  under this Part must be performed based on the viewing of images  displayed as soft copies using the viewing workstations specified in  this section. Classification of radiographs must not be based on the  viewing of hard copy printed transparencies of images that were  digitally-acquired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The classification of chest radiographs based on digitized  copies of chest radiographs that were originally   acquired using film-screen techniques is not permissible under this  part.
