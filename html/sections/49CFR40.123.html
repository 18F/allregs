This includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensuring the review of the CCF on all specimen collections for the purposes of determining whether there is a problem that may cause a test to be cancelled (see Sec. Sec. 40.199-40.203). As an MRO, you are not required to review laboratory internal chain of custody documentation. No one is permitted to cancel a test because you have not reviewed this documentation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing feedback to employers, collection sites and laboratories regarding performance issues where necessary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reporting to and consulting with the ODAPC or a relevant DOT agency when you wish DOT assistance in resolving any program issue. As an employer or service agent, you are prohibited from limiting or attempting to limit the MRO's access to DOT for this purpose and from retaliating in any way against an MRO for discussing drug testing issues with DOT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, and invalid drug tests results from the laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> While you provide medical review of employees' test results, this part does not deem that you have established a doctor-patient relationship with the employees whose tests you review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must act to investigate and correct problems where possible and notify appropriate parties (e.g., HHS, DOT, employers, service agents) where

assistance is needed, (e.g., cancelled or problematic tests, incorrect results, problems with blind specimens).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must ensure the timely flow of test results and other information to employers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must protect the confidentiality of the drug testing information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You must perform all your functions in compliance with this part and other DOT agency regulations.</p>
