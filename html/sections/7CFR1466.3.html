                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions will apply to this part and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural land means cropland, grassland, rangeland, pasture, and other agricultural land, on which agricultural and forest-related products or livestock are produced and resource concerns may be addressed. Other agricultural lands include cropped woodland, marshes, incidental areas included in the agricultural operation, and other types of agricultural land used for production of livestock.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural operation means a parcel or parcels of land whether contiguous or noncontiguous, which the producer is listed as the operator or owner/operator in the Farm Service Agency (FSA) record system, which is under the effective control of the producer at the time the producer applies for a contract, and which is operated by the producer with equipment, labor, management, and production, forestry, or cultivation practices that are substantially separate from other operations.</p><p class="depth0">Animal feeding operation (AFO) means an agricultural operation where animals are kept and raised in confined situations. AFOs congregate animals, feed, manure, dead animals, and production operations on a small land area. Feed is brought to the animals rather than the animals grazing or otherwise seeking feed in pastures, fields, or on rangeland. An AFO is a lot or facility (other than an aquatic animal production facility) where the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Animals have been, are, or will be stabled or confined and fed or maintained for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Crops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility.</p><p class="depth0">Animal waste storage or treatment facility means a structural conservation practice, implemented on an AFO consistent with the requirements of a Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan (CNMP) and Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG), which is used for storing, treating, or handling animal waste or byproducts, such as animal carcasses.</p><p class="depth0">Applicant means a producer who has requested in writing to participate in EQIP.</p><p class="depth0">At-risk species means any plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered; proposed or candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act; a species listed as threatened or endangered under State law or Tribal law on Tribal land; State or Tribal land species of conservation concern; or other plant or animal species or community, as determined by the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee or Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, that has undergone, or is likely to undergo, population decline and may become imperiled without direct intervention.</p><p class="depth0">Beginning farmer or rancher means a person, Indian Tribe, Tribal corporation,, or legal entity who:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Has not operated a farm or ranch, or NIPF, or who has operated a farm,

ranch, or NIPF for not more than ten consecutive years. This requirement applies to all members of an entity, who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a contract with an individual, individually, or with the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and management of the farm or ranch, consistent with the practices in the county or State where the farm is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a contract with an entity or joint operation, all members must materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch. Material and substantial participation requires that each of the members provide some amount of the management, or labor and management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm or ranch would be seriously impaired.</p><p class="depth0">Chief means the Chief of NRCS, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), or designee.</p><p class="depth0">Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan means a conservation plan that is specifically for an AFO. A CNMP identifies conservation practices and management activities which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will manage sufficient quantities of manure, waste water, or organic by-products associated with a waste management facility. A CNMP incorporates practices to use animal manure and organic by-products as a beneficial resource while protecting all natural resources including water and air quality associated with an AFO. A CNMP is developed to assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal water quality goals or regulations. For nutrient impaired stream segments or water bodies, additional management activities or conservation practices may be required by local, Tribal, State, or Federal water quality goals or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation benefit means the improved condition of a natural resource concern resulting from the implementation of a conservation practice.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation district means any district or unit of State, Tribal, or local government formed under State, Tribal, or territorial law for the express purpose of developing and carrying out a local soil and water conservation program. Such district or unit of government may be referred to as a ``conservation district,'' ``soil conservation district,'' ``soil and water conservation district,'' ``resource conservation district,'' ``land conservation committee,'' ``natural resource district,'' or similar name.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) means competitive grants made under EQIP to individuals, Indian Tribes, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations to stimulate and transfer innovative technologies and approaches, to leverage Federal funds, and to enhance and protect the environment in conjunction with agricultural production and forest management.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation practice means one or more conservation improvements and activities, including structural practices, land management practices, vegetative practices, forest management practices, and other improvements that achieve the program purposes, including such items as CNMPs, agricultural energy management plans, dryland transition plans, forest management plans, integrated pest management, and other plans or activities determined acceptable by the Chief. Approved conservation practices are listed in the NRCS FOTG.</p><p class="depth0">Contract means a legal document that specifies the rights and obligations of any participant accepted into the program.

The EQIP plan of operations is part of the EQIP contract.</p><p class="depth0">Estimated income foregone means an estimate of the net income loss associated with the adoption of a conservation practice. Along with other estimated incurred costs, foregone income is one of the costs associated with practice implementation as recorded in a payment schedule. NRCS calculates foregone income as the average annual net income ($/unit/year) lost from implementing a conservation practice which results in a change in land use or land taken out of production or the opportunity cost associated with the adoption of a conservation practice. Foregone income will not include losses of income due to disaster or other events unrelated to the conservation practice such as risk associated with agricultural production.</p><p class="depth0">Field office technical guide (FOTG) means the official local NRCS source of resource information and interpretations of guidelines, criteria, and requirements for planning and implementation of conservation practices.
