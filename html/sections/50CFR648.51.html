                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Trawl vessel gear restrictions. Trawl vessels issued a limited access scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2) while fishing under or subject to the DAS allocation program for scallops and authorized to fish with or possess on board trawl nets pursuant to Sec. 648.51(f), any trawl vessels in possession of more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops in or from the EEZ, and any trawl vessels fishing for scallops in the EEZ, must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maximum sweep. The trawl sweep of nets shall not exceed 144 ft (43.9 m), as measured by the total length of the footrope that is directly attached to the webbing, unless the net is stowed and not available for immediate use, defined in Sec. 648.2, or unless the vessel is fishing under the Northeast multispecies or monkfish DAS programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net requirements--(i) Minimum mesh size. Subject to applicable minimum mesh size restrictions for other fisheries as specified under this part, the mesh size for any scallop trawl net in all areas shall not be smaller than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Minimum mesh size. Subject to applicable minimum mesh size restrictions for other fisheries as specified under this part, the mesh size for any scallop trawl net in all areas shall not be smaller than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Measurement of mesh size. Mesh size is measured by using a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm (0.79 inches) in 8 cm (3.15 inches) and a thickness of 2.3 mm (0.09 inches), inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 5 kg (11.02 lb) for mesh size less than 120 mm (4.72 inches) and under a pressure or pull of 8 kg (17.64 lb) for mesh size at, or greater than, 120 mm (4.72 inches). The mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive meshes for nets having 75 or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for nets having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of the net is measured at least five meshes away from the lacings running parallel to the long axis of the net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Net obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any device

or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line and rope no more than 3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. ``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top of the trawl net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any device

or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line and rope no more than 3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. ``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top of the trawl net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mesh obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, if it obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A fishing vessel may not use or possess a net capable of catching scallops in which the bars entering or exiting the knots twist around each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dredge vessel gear restrictions. All vessels issued limited access and General Category scallop permits and fishing with scallop dredges, with the exception of hydraulic clam dredges and mahogany quahog dredges in possession of 600 lb (181.44 kg), or less, of scallops, must comply with the following restrictions, unless otherwise specified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maximum dredge width. The combined dredge width in use by or in possession on board such vessels shall not exceed 31 ft (9.4 m), measured at the widest point in the bail of the dredge, except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, in Sec. 648.60(g)(2), and the scallop dredge exemption areas specified in Sec. 648.80. However, component parts may be on board the vessel such that they do not conform with the definition of ``dredge or dredge gear'' in Sec. 648.2, i.e., the metal ring bag and the mouth frame, or bail, of the dredge are not attached, and such that no more than one complete spare dredge could be made from these component's parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum mesh size. The mesh size of a net, net material, or any other material on the top of a scallop dredge (twine top) possessed or used by vessels fishing with scallop dredge gear shall not be smaller than 10-inch (25.4-cm) square or diamond mesh.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum ring size. (i) Unless otherwise required under the Sea Scallop Area Access program specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(6), the ring size used in a scallop dredge possessed or used by scallop vessels shall not be smaller than 4 inches (10.2 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unless otherwise required under the Sea Scallop Area Access program specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(6), the ring size used in a scallop dredge possessed or used by scallop vessels shall not be smaller than 4 inches (10.2 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ring size is determined by measuring the shortest straight line passing through the center of the ring from one inside edge to the opposite inside edge of the ring. The measurement shall not include normal welds from ring manufacturing or links. The rings to be measured will be at least five rings away from the mouth, and at least two rings away from other rigid portions of the dredge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Chafing gear restrictions. No chafing gear or cookies shall be used on the top of a scallop dredge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Chafing gear restrictions. No chafing gear or cookies shall be used on the top of a scallop dredge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Link restrictions. No more than double links between rings shall be used in or on all parts of the dredge bag, except the dredge bottom. No more than triple linking shall be used in or on the dredge bottom portion and the diamonds. Damaged links that are connected to only one ring, i.e., ``hangers,'' are allowed, unless they occur between two links that both couple the same two rings. Dredge rings may not be attached via links to more than four adjacent rings. Thus, dredge rings must be rigged in a configuration such that, when a series of adjacent rings are held horizontally, the neighboring rings form a pattern of horizontal rows and vertical columns. A copy of a diagram showing a schematic of a legal dredge ring pattern is available from the Regional Administrator upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dredge or net obstructions. No material, device, net, dredge, ring, or link configuration or design shall be used if it results in obstructing the release of scallops that would have passed through a legal sized and configured net and dredge, as described in this part, that did not have in use any such material, device, net, dredge, ring link configuration or design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Twine top restrictions as a proactive accountability measure for bycatch. In addition to the minimum twine top mesh size specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, limited access and limited access general category IFQ vessels may not fish for scallops with a dredge having more than seven rows of non-overlapping steel rings unobstructed by netting or any other material between the terminus of the dredge (club stick) and the net material on the top of the dredge (twine top) (a copy of a diagram showing a schematic of a legal dredge with twine top is available from the Regional Administrator upon request).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Measurement of twine top mesh size. Twine top mesh size is measured by using a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 0.79 inches (2 cm) in 3.15 inches (8 cm) and a thickness of 0.09 inches (2.3 mm), inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 17.64 lb (8 kg). The mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive meshes for twine tops having 75 or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for twine tops having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh in the twine top must be measured along the length of the twine top, running parallel to a longitudinal axis, and be at least five meshes away from where the twine top mesh meets the rings, running parallel to the long axis of the twine top.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Restrictions applicable to sea scallop dredges in the mid-Atlantic--(i) Requirement to use chain mats. See Sec. 223.206(d)(11) of this chapter for chain mat requirements for scallop dredges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requirement to use chain mats. See Sec. 223.206(d)(11) of this chapter for chain mat requirements for scallop dredges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirement to use a turtle deflector dredge (TDD) frame--(A) From May 1 through November 30, any limited access scallop vessel using a dredge, regardless of dredge size or vessel permit category, or any LAGC IFQ scallop vessel fishing with a dredge with a width of 10.5 ft (3.2 m) or greater, that is fishing for scallops in waters west of 71 W. long., from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the EEZ, must use a TDD. The TDD requires five modifications to the rigid dredge frame, as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A)(1) through (5) of this section. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section for more specific descriptions of the dredge elements mentioned below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cutting bar must be located in front of the depressor plate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The acute angle between the plane of the bale and the strut must be less than or equal to 45 degrees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All bale bars must be removed, except the outer bale (single or double) bars and the center support beam, leaving an otherwise unobstructed space between the cutting bar and forward bale wheels, if present. The center support beam must be less than 6 inches (15.24 cm) wide. For the purpose of flaring and safe handling of the dredge, a minor appendage not to exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length may be attached to each of the outer bale bars. If the flaring bar is attached in a u-shape, none of the three sides of the flaring bar shall exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. The appendage shall at no point be closer than 12 inches (30.5 cm) to the cutting bar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Struts must be spaced 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart or less from each other, along the entire length of the frame.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unless exempted, as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the TDD must include a straight extension (``bump out'') connecting the outer bale bars to the dredge frame. This ``bump out'' must exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length, as measured along the inside of the bale bar from the front of the cutting bar to the first bend in the bale bar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A limited access scallop vessel that uses a dredge with a width less than 10.5 ft (3.2 m) is required to use a TDD, except that such a vessel is exempt from the ``bump out'' requirement specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A)(5) of this section. This exemption does not apply to LAGC vessels that use dredges with a width of less than 10.5 ft (3.2 m), because such vessels are exempted from the requirement to use a TDD, as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A vessels subject to the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section transiting waters west of 71 W. long., from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the EEZ, is exempted from the requirement to only possess and use TDDs, provided the dredge gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> TDD-related definitions. (1) The cutting bar refers to the lowermost horizontal bar connecting the outer bails at the dredge frame.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The depressor plate, also known as the pressure plate, is the angled piece of steel welded along the length of the top of the dredge frame.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The struts are the metal bars connecting the cutting bar and the depressor plate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Crew restrictions. A limited access vessel participating in or subject to the scallop DAS allocation program may have no more than seven people aboard, including the operator, and a limited access vessel participating in the Sea Scallop Area Access Program as specified in Sec. 648.60 may have no more than eight people aboard, including the operator, when not docked or moored in port, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A vessel participating in the small dredge program is restricted as specified in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Regional Administrator may authorize additional people to be on board through issuance of a letter of authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A certified at-sea observer is on board, as required by Sec. 648.11(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sorting and shucking machines. (1) Shucking machines are prohibited on all limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS program, or any vessel in possession of more than 600 lb (272.2 kg) of scallops, unless the vessel has not been issued a limited access scallop permit and fishes exclusively in state waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Shucking machines are prohibited on all limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS program, or any vessel in possession of more than 600 lb (272.2 kg) of scallops, unless the vessel has not been issued a limited access scallop permit and fishes exclusively in state waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sorting machines are prohibited on limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Small dredge program restrictions. Any vessel owner whose vessel is assigned to either the part-time or Occasional category may request, in the application for the vessel's annual permit, to be placed in one category higher. Vessel owners making such request may be placed in the appropriate higher category for the entire year, if they agree to comply with the following restrictions, in addition to, and notwithstanding other restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program described in Sec. 648.53:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 10.5 ft (3.2 m) in width.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vessel may not use or have more than one dredge on board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The vessel may have no more than five people, including the operator, on board, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A vessel participating in the Sea Scallop Area Access Program as specified in Sec. 648.60 may have no more than six people, including the operator, on board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator may authorize additional people to be on board through issuance of a letter of authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A certified at-sea observer is on board, as required by Sec. 648.11(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Restrictions on the use of trawl nets. (1) A vessel issued a limited access scallop permit fishing for scallops under the scallop DAS allocation program may not fish with, possess on board, or land scallops while in possession of a trawl net, unless such vessel has been issued a limited access trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for scallops with a trawl net. A limited access scallop vessel issued a trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for scallops with a trawl net and general category scallop vessels enrolled in the Area Access Program as specified in Sec. 648.60, may not fish with a trawl net in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A vessel issued a limited access scallop permit fishing for scallops under the scallop DAS allocation program may not fish with, possess on board, or land scallops while in possession of a trawl net, unless such vessel has been issued a limited access trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for scallops with a trawl net. A limited access scallop vessel issued a trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for scallops with a trawl net and general category scallop vessels enrolled in the Area Access Program as specified in Sec. 648.60, may not fish with a trawl net in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replacement vessels.
