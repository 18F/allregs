                            <p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exchanges with offerors after establishment of the competitive range. The Project Officer or technical evaluation panel shall develop technical questions as part of the technical evaluation report. The questions shall disclose the ambiguities, weaknesses, and deficiencies of offeror(s)' proposals. The Contracting Officer, with the assistance of the Project Officer or panel as required, shall prepare the management, past performance, and cost or price questions. The method of requesting offerors in the competitive range to submit additional information may vary depending on the complexity of the questions, the extent of additional information necessary, the time needed to analyze the responses, and the time frame for making the award. However, to the extent practicable, all questions and answers shall be in writing. The Contracting Officer shall give each offeror in the competitive range an equitable period of time for preparation of responses to questions to the extent practicable.</p>
