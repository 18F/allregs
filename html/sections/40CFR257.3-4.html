                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A facility or practice shall not contaminate an underground  drinking water source beyond the solid waste   boundary or beyond an alternative boundary specified in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of section 1008(a)(3) of the Act or section  405(d) of the CWA, a party charged with open dumping or a violation of  section 405(e) with respect to sewage sludge that is not used or  disposed through a practice regulated in 40 CFR part 503 may demonstrate  that compliance should be determined at an alternative boundary in lieu  of the solid waste boundary. The court shall establish an alternative  boundary only if it finds that such a change would not result in  contamination of ground water which may be needed or used for human  consumption. This finding shall be based on analysis and consideration  of all of the following factors that are relevant:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and  surrounding land, including any natural attenuation and dilution  characteristics of the aquifer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the  leachate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The quantity, quality, and direction of flow of ground water  underlying the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The availability of alternative drinking water supplies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The existing quality of the ground water, including other  sources of contamination and their cumulative impacts on the ground  water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Public health, safety, and welfare effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of sections 4004(a) and 1008(a)(3), the State may  establish an alternative boundary for a facility to be used in lieu of  the solid waste boundary only if it finds that such a change would not  result in the contamination of ground water which may be needed or used  for human consumption. Such a finding shall be based on an analysis and  consideration of all of the factors identified in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section that are relevant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aquifer means a geologic formation, group of formations, or  portion of a formation capable of yielding usable quantities of ground  water to wells or springs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contaminate means introduce a substance that would cause:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The concentration of that substance in the ground water to  exceed the maximum contaminant level specified in appendix I, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An increase in the concentration of that substance in the  ground water where the existing concentration of that substance exceeds  the maximum contaminant level specified in appendix I.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ground water means water below the land surface in the zone of  saturation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Underground drinking water source means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An aquifer supplying drinking water for human consumption, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An aquifer in which the ground water contains less than 10,000  mg/1 total dissolved solids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Solid waste boundary means the outermost perimeter of the solid  waste (projected in the horizontal plane) as it would exist at  completion of the disposal activity.
