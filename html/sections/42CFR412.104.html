CMS provides an additional payment  to a hospital for inpatient services provided to ESRD beneficiaries who  receive a dialysis treatment during a hospital stay, if the hospital has  established that ESRD beneficiary discharges, excluding discharges  classified into MS-DRG 652 (Renal Failure), MS-DRG 682 (Renal Failure  with MCC), MS-DRG 683 (Renal Failure with CC), MS-DRG 684 (Renal Failure  without CC/MCC) and MS-DRG 685 (Admit for Renal Dialysis), where the  beneficiary received dialysis services during the inpatient stay,  constitute 10 percent or more of its total Medicare discharges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional payment. A hospital that meets the criteria of  paragraph (a) of this section is paid an additional payment for each  ESRD beneficiary discharge except those excluded under paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payment is based on the estimated weekly cost of dialysis  and the average length of stay of ESRD beneficiaries for the hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated weekly cost of dialysis is the average number of  dialysis sessions furnished per week during the 12-month period that  ended June 30, 1983 multiplied by the average cost of dialysis for the  same period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The average cost of dialysis includes only those costs  determined to be directly related to the dialysis service. (These costs  include salary, employee health and welfare, drugs, supplies, and  laboratory services.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The average cost of dialysis is reviewed and adjusted, if  appropriate, at the time the composite rate reimbursement for outpatient  dialysis is reviewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The payment to a hospital equals the average length of stay of  ESRD beneficiaries in the hospital, expressed as a ratio to one week,  times the estimated weekly cost of dialysis multiplied by the number of  ESRD beneficiary discharges except for those excluded under paragraph  (a) of this section. This payment is made only on the Federal portion of  the payment rate.
