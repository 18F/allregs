The responsible HHS official may subordinate the Federal interest in such property to that of a lender, which financed the acquisition or major renovation costs subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facilities acquired with grant funds may not be mortgaged or used as collateral, or sold or otherwise transferred to another party, without the written permission of the responsible HHS official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of the facility for other than the purpose for which the facility was funded, without the express written approval of the responsible HHS official, is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> A grantee receiving funds to acquire or make major renovations to a facility that is or will be sited on land not owned by the grantee must have a lease or other arrangement which protects the Federal interest in the facility and ensures the grantee's undisturbed use and possession of the facility. The lease or document evidencing another arrangement shall include provisions to protect the right of the grantee, or some other organization designated by ACF in the place of the grantee, to occupy the facility for the term of the lease or other arrangement and such other terms required by the responsible HHS official. The designation of an alternate tenant or occupant of the facility by ACF shall be subject to approval by the Lessor, which will not be withheld except for good reason, not including the willingness of another party to pay a higher rent. A grantee receiving funds for the major renovation or acquisition of a facility, on land belonging to another party, must have a land lease or other similar interest in the underlying land which is long enough to allow the Head Start program to receive the full value of

those permanent grant-supported improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A grantee receiving funds to acquire or make major renovations to a facility that is or will be sited on land not owned by the grantee must have a lease or other arrangement which protects the Federal interest in the facility and ensures the grantee's undisturbed use and possession of the facility.

The lease or other document must ensure the right of the grantee to have undisturbed use and possession of the facility. In the event that filing of a lease is prohibited by State law, the grantee shall file an affidavit signed by the representatives of the grantee and the Lessor stating that the lease includes terms which protect the right of the grantee, or some other organization designated by ACF in the place of the grantee, to occupy the facility for the term of the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Notice of Federal Interest for property sited on land not owned by the grantee shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of the award of grant funds for the acquisition or major renovation of the property to be used as a Head Start facility, and the address and legal description of the property to be acquired or renovated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the grant incorporated conditions which included restrictions on the use of the property and provide for a Federal interest in the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the property may not be used for any purpose inconsistent with that authorized by the Head Start Act and applicable regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the property may not be mortgaged or used as collateral, sold or otherwise transferred to another party, without the written permission of the responsible HHS official;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That these grant conditions and requirements cannot be altered or nullified through a transfer of ownership; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The name (including signature) and title of the person who completed the Notice for the grantee agency, and the date of the Notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A lease, serving as a Notice of Federal Interest, an affidavit filed in the land records as a substitute for the lease, or other document protecting the Federal interest in a facility acquired with grant funds and sited on land not owned by the grantee, shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The address and legal description of the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the grant incorporated conditions which include restrictions on the use of the property and provide for a Federal interest in the property for the term of the lease or other arrangement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the property may not be used for any purpose during the lease or other arrangement that is inconsistent with that authorized by the Head Start Act and applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grantees must meet all of the requirements in 45 CFR parts 74 or 92 pertaining to the purchase and disposition of real property, or the use and disposal of equipment, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In subordinating its interest in a facility acquired or upon which major renovations have been undertaken with grant funds, the responsible HHS officials does not waive application of paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1309.22.
