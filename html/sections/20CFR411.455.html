                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of an IWP is to outline the specific employment  services, vocational rehabilitation services and other support services  that the EN and beneficiary have determined are necessary to achieve the  beneficiary's stated employment goal. An IWP provides written  documentation for both the EN and beneficiary. Both parties should  develop and implement the IWP in partnership. The EN shall develop and  implement the plan in a manner that gives the beneficiary the  opportunity to exercise informed choice in selecting an employment goal.  Specific services needed to achieve the designated employment goal are  discussed and agreed to by both parties.</p>
