                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General (refer also to subpart 56.75). Brazed socket-type joints  shall be made with suitable brazing alloys. The minimum socket depth  shall be sufficient for the intended service. Brazing alloy shall either  be end-fed into the socket or shall be provided in the form of a  preinserted ring in a groove in the socket. The brazing alloy shall be  sufficient to fill completely the annular clearance between the socket  and the pipe or tube.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Brazed socket-type joints shall not be used on  systems containing flammable or combustible fluids in areas where fire  hazards are involved or where the service temperature exceeds 425  [deg]F. When specifically approved by the Commandant, brazed  construction may be used for service temperatures up to 525 [deg]F. in  boiler steam air heaters provided the requirements of UB-12 of section  VIII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference;  see 46 CFR 56.01-2) are satisfied at the highest temperature desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Brazed joints depending solely upon a fillet, rather than  primarily upon brazing material between the pipe and socket are not  acceptable.
