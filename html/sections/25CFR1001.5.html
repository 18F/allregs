This ranking will constitute a master list that will be maintained and updated on a continuous basis from year to year. When receipt dates are the same for two or more applications, several other factors will be considered in determining the placement of the tribe or consortium on the list. These factors are identified in priority order as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designation by the Congress through report language that a tribe should be considered for participation. These designations will be considered based upon the actual language of the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation of OSG sanctioning of the tribe's self-governance planning and subsequent evidence of actual planning by the tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of a completed planning or negotiation grant application in the previous year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A signed agreement pursuant to the Indian Health Service (IHS) self-governance project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Receipt of a planning grant awarded by the IHS.</p>
