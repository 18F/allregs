                            <p class="depth0">If you are an operator who mined coal after June 1988, you may deduct the weight of excess moisture in the coal to determine reclamation fees you owe under 30 CFR 870.12(b)(3)(i). Excess moisture is the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture. To calculate excess moisture in HIGH-rank coal, follow Sec. 870.19. To calculate excess moisture in LOW-rank coal, follow Sec. 870.20. Report your calculations on the OSM-1 form, Coal Reclamation Fee Report, for every calendar quarter in which you claim a deduction. Some cautions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You or your customer may do any test required by Sec. Sec. 870.19 and 870.20. But whoever does a test, you are to keep test results and all related records for at least six years after the test date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If OSM disallows any or all of an allowance for excess moisture, you must submit an additional fee plus interest computed according to Sec. 870.21(a) and penalties computed according to Sec. 870.21(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following definitions are applicable to Sec. Sec. 870.19 and 870.20. ASTM standards D4596-93, Standard Practice for Collection of Channel Samples of Coal in a Mine; D5192-91, Standard Practice for Collection of Coal Samples from Core; and, D1412-93, Standard Test Method for Equilibrium Moisture of Coal at 96 to 97 Percent Relative Humidity and 30 [deg]C are incorporated by reference as published in the 1994 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Volume 05.05. The Director of the Federal Register approved this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Each applicable ASTM standard is incorporated as it exists on the date of the approval, and a notice of any change in it will be published in the Federal Register. You may obtain copies from the ASTM, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428. A copy of the ASTM standards is available for inspection at the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Administrative Record, Room 101, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
