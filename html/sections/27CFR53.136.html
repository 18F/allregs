                                Sec. 53.136  Tax-free sales of articles to nonprofit
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(5) of the Code and this section, to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term ``nonprofit educational organization''. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that

the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code, and paragraph (e) of Sec. 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a nonprofit educational organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonprofit educational organization. The term ``nonprofit educational organization'' means an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code. Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) describes an ``educational organization'' as one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code, provided the primary function of such school is the presentation of formal instruction and provided such school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence required in support of tax-free sales to nonprofit educational organizations. Every nonprofit educational organization purchasing tax free under section 4221(a)(5) of the Code must furnish the following information to the seller:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tax exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Its registration number. Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale ``except that a single notification containing the information described in this paragraph may cover all sales by the seller to the purchaser made during a designated period not to exceed 12 successive calendar quarters.''. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 53.131 for the evidence required to establish exemption.
