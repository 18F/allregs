Any employer of employees to whom  section 7 of the Act does not apply because of an exemption of broad  application to an establishment may alter or modify the poster with a  legible notation to show that the overtime provisions do not apply. For  example:  Overtime Provisions Not Applicable to Taxicab Drivers (section  13(b)(17)).</p>
