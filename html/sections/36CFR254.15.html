For example,  encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, mortgages, and other  objections or title defects shall be eliminated, released, or waived in  accordance with requirements of the preliminary title opinion of the  USDA Office of the General Counsel or the Department of Justice, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The United States shall not accept lands in which there are  reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and  management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be  inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which,  the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal  landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the  Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in  the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR  part 251, subpart A).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is  not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non- Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless  the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange  previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal  property. If the personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of  title or within the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed  abandoned and shall become vested in the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements  for the relocation of any tenants. Qualified tenants occupying non- Federal lands affected by a land exchange may be entitled to relocation  benefits under 49 CFR 24.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or  regulation (49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)), relocation benefits are not applicable  to owner-occupants involved in exchanges with the United States provided  the owner-occupants are notified in writing that the non-Federal lands  are being acquired by the United States on a voluntary basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal lands. If Federal lands proposed for exchange are  occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third  party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such  authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach  agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under  the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal  exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to  issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by  the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the  authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the  authorized use or shall determine whether there are specific and  compelling reasons in the public interest for revoking the authorization  for that use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.
