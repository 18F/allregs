                            <p class="depth0">A solar simulator used for determining the SPF of a sunscreen drug  product should be filtered so that it provides a continuous emission  spectrum from 290 to 400 nanometers similar to sunlight at sea level  from the sun at a zenith angle of 10[deg] it has less than 1 percent of  its total energy output contributed by nonsolar wavelengths shorter than  290 nanometers; and it has not more than 5 percent of its total energy  output contributed by wavelengths longer than 400 nanometers. In  addition, a solar simulator should have no significant time-related  fluctuations in radiation emissions after an appropriate warmup time,  and it should have good beam uniformity (within 10 percent) in the  exposure plane. To ensure that the solar simulator delivers the  appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, it must be measured periodically  with an accurately-calibrated spectroradiometer system or equivalent  instrument.</p>
