Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.</p>
