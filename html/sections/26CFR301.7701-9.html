                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term Secretary or his delegate means the Secretary of the  Treasury, or any officer, employee, or agency of the Treasury Department  duly authorized by the Secretary (directly, or indirectly by one or more  redelegations of authority) to perform the function mentioned or  described in the context, and the term ``or his delegate'' when used in  connection with any other official of the United States shall be  similarly construed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any case in which a function is vested by the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954 or any other statute in the Secretary or his  delegate, and Treasury regulations or Treasury decisions approved by the  Secretary or his delegate provide that such function may be performed by  the Commissioner, assistant commissioner, regional commissioner,  assistant regional commissioner, district director, director of a  regional service center, or by a designated officer or employee in the  office of any such officer, such provision in the regulations or  Treasury decision shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary of the  authority to perform such function to the designated officer or  employee. If such authority is delegated to any officer or employee  performing services under the supervision and control of the  Commissioner, such provision in the regulations or Treasury decision  shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary to the Commissioner of  the authority to perform such function and a redelegation thereof by the  Commissioner to the designated officer or employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An officer or employee, including the Commissioner, authorized  by regulations or Treasury decision to perform a function shall have  authority to redelegate the performance of such function to any officer  or employee performing services under his supervision and control,  unless such power to so redelegate is prohibited or restricted by   proper order or directive. The Commissioner may also redelegate  authority to perform such function to other officers or employees under  his supervision and control and, to the extent he deems proper, may  authorize further redelegation of such authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commissioner may prescribe such limitations as he deems  proper on the extent to which any officer or employee under his  supervision and control shall perform any such function, but, in the  case of an officer or employee designated in regulations or Treasury  decision as authorized to perform such function, such limitations shall  not render invalid any performance by such officer or employee of the  function which, except for such limitations, such officer or employee is  authorized to perform by such regulations or Treasury decision in effect  at the time the function is performed.</p>
