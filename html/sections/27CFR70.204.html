                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Title 26 U.S.C. 7425(b) contains provisions with  respect to the effect on the interest of the United States in property  in which the United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from  the enforcement of a lien, of a sale made pursuant to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An instrument creating a lien on the property sold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an  instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statutory lien on the property sold.</p><p class="depth3">For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a  ``nonjudicial sale.'' The term ``nonjudicial sale'' includes, but is not  limited to, the divestment of the taxpayer's interest in property which  occurs by operation of law, by public or private sale, by forfeiture, or  by termination under provisions contained in a contract for a deed or a  conditional sales contract. Under 26 U.S.C. 7425(b)(1), if a notice of  lien is filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) or (g), or the title  derived from the enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local  law, more than 30 days before the date of sale and the appropriate TTB  officer is not given notice of the sale (in the manner prescribed in  Sec. 70.205 of this part), the sale shall be made subject to and  without disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under 26  U.S.C. 7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given  to the appropriate TTB officer not less than 25 days prior to the date  of sale (in the manner prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7425(c)(1)), the sale  shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment  of the lien or title as may be provided by local law with respect to  other junior liens or other titles derived from the enforcement of  junior liens. A nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a  tax lien does not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the  nonjudicial sale is given to the appropriate TTB officer. However, under  the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6325(b) and Sec. 70.150 of   this part, designated officers may discharge the property from a tax  lien, including a tax lien which is senior to another lien upon the  property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, in order to compute any period of time  determined with reference to the date of sale, the date of sale shall be  determined in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting  directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date  the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which  junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property  is transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting  directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date  title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior  liens on the property are divested under local law, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not  resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is  deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested  under local law. For provisions relating to the right of redemption of  the United States, see 26 U.S.C. 7425(d) and Sec. 70.206 of this part.  (26 U.S.C. 7425(b))</p>
