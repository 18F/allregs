                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis. Sections 1903(a)(1), 1903(g), 1905(b), 1905(y), and 1905(z) provide for payments to States, on the basis of a Federal medical assistance percentage, for part of their expenditures for services under an approved State plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)--Computations. The FMAP is determined by the formula described in section 1905(b) of the Act. Under the formula, if a State's per capita income is equal to the national average per capita income, the Federal share is 55 percent. If a State's per capita income exceeds the national average, the Federal share is lower, with a statutory minimum of 50 percent. If a State's per capita income is lower than the national average, the Federal share is increased, with a statutory maximum of 83 percent. The formula used in determining the State and Federal share is as follows:
State Share = [(State per capita income) \2\/(National per capita</p><p class="depth2">income) \2\] x 45 percentFederal share = 100 percent minus the State share (with a minimum of 50</p><p class="depth2">percent and a maximum of 83 percent)

The formula provides for squaring both the State and national average per capita incomes; this procedure magnifies any difference between the State's income and the national average. Consequently, Federal matching to lower income States is increased, and Federal matching to higher income States is decreased, within the statutory 50-83 percent limits. The FMAP for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa is set by statute at 50 percent and is subject to dollar limitations specified in section 1108 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special provisions.
