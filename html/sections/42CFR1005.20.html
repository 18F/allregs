The decision will be accompanied by a  statement describing the right of any party to file a notice of appeal  with the DAB and instructions for how to file such appeal. If the ALJ  fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she will  notify the parties of the reason for the delay and will set a new  deadline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except for exclusion actions taken in accordance with Sec.  1001.2003 of this chapter and as provided in paragraph (e) of this  section, unless the initial decision is appealed to the DAB, it will be  final and binding on the parties 30 days after the ALJ serves the  parties with a copy of the decision.
