A CEBA Lease entered into prior to July 22, 1991, may continue to be administered in accordance with the lease terms in effect as of that date. For purposes of applying the lending limits and the restrictions on transactions with affiliates described in Sec. 23.6, however, a national bank that enters into a new extension of credit to a customer, including a lease, on or after July 22, 1991, shall include all outstanding leases regardless of the date on which they were made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Renewal of non-conforming leases. A national bank may renew a CEBA Lease that was entered into prior to July 22, 1991, and that is not a conforming lease only if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bank entered into the CEBA Lease in good faith;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expiring lease contains a binding agreement requiring that the bank renew the lease at the lessee's option, and the bank cannot reasonably avoid its commitment to do so; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bank determines in good faith, and demonstrates by appropriate documentation, that renewal of the lease is necessary to avoid financial loss and to recover its investment in, and its cost of financing, the leased property.</p>
