                                Sec. 1904.46  Definitions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Act. The Act means the Occupational Safety and Health Act of  1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.). The definitions contained in section 3 of  the Act (29 U.S.C. 652) and related interpretations apply to such terms  when used in this part 1904.</p><p class="depth0">Establishment. An establishment is a single physical location where  business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are  performed. For activities where employees do not work at a single  physical location, such as construction; transportation; communications,  electric, gas and sanitary services; and similar operations, the  establishment is represented by main or branch offices, terminals,  stations, etc. that either supervise such activities or are the base  from which personnel carry out these activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Can one business location include two or more establishments?  Normally, one business location has only one establishment. Under  limited conditions, the employer may consider two or more separate  businesses that share a single location to be separate establishments.  An employer may divide one location into two or more establishments only  when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Each of the establishments represents a distinctly separate  business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Each business is engaged in a different economic activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> No one industry description in the Standard Industrial  Classification Manual (1987) applies to the joint activities of the  establishments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Separate reports are routinely prepared for each establishment  on the number of employees, their wages and salaries, sales or receipts,  and other business information. For example, if an employer operates a  construction company at the same location as a lumber yard, the employer  may consider each business to be a separate establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Can an establishment include more than one physical location?  Yes, but only under certain conditions. An employer may combine two or  more physical locations into a single establishment only when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The employer operates the locations as a single business  operation under common management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The locations are all located in close proximity to each other;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The employer keeps one set of business records for the  locations, such as records on the number of employees, their wages and  salaries, sales or receipts, and other kinds of business information.  For example, one manufacturing establishment might include the main  plant, a warehouse a few blocks away, and an administrative services  building across the street.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth2">Injury or illness. An injury or illness is an abnormal condition or  disorder. Injuries include cases such as, but not limited to, a cut,  fracture, sprain, or amputation. Illnesses include both acute and  chronic illnesses, such as, but not limited to, a skin disease,  respiratory disorder, or poisoning. (Note: Injuries and illnesses are  recordable only if they are new, work-related cases that meet one or  more of the part 1904 recording criteria.)</p><p class="depth2">Physician or Other Licensed Health Care Professional. A physician or  other licensed health care professional is an individual whose legally  permitted scope of practice (i.e., license, registration, or  certification) allows him or her to independently perform, or be  delegated the responsibility to perform, the activities described by  this regulation.</p><p class="depth2">You. ``You'' means an employer as defined in section 3 of the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 652).</p>
