At the same time similar notice regarding detention of the containers shall be sent to the District Director of Customs, requesting him to refuse delivery thereof or to require their return to customs custody if by any chance the containers were released without the bond referred to in Sec. 1230.41. The time allowed the importer for representations regarding the shipment may be extended at his request for a reasonable period to permit him to secure such evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the importer does not reply to the notice of hearing in person or by letter within the time allowed on the notice, a second notice, marked ``second and last notice,'' shall be sent at once by the chief of the district, advising him that failure to reply will cause definite recommendation to the District Director of Customs that the containers be refused admission and that the containers be exported within 3 months under customs supervision.</p>
