                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Keep records and reports as specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW, or in the Federal plan, EPA approved State plan or tribal plan that implements 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc, whichever applies to your landfill, with one exception: You must submit the annual report described in 40 CFR 60.757(f) every 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must also keep records and reports as specified in the general provisions of 40 CFR part 60 and this part as shown in Table 1 of this subpart. Applicable records in the general provisions include items such as SSM plans and the SSM plan reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For bioreactors at new affected sources you must submit the initial semiannual compliance report and performance test results described in 40 CFR 60.757(f) within 180 days after the date you are required to begin operating the gas collection and control system by Sec. 63.1947(a)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For bioreactors at existing affected sources, you must submit the initial semiannual compliance report and performance test results described in 40 CFR 60.757(f) within 180 days after the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1947(b) of this subpart, unless you have previously submitted a compliance report for the bioreactor required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW, the Federal plan, or an EPA approved and effective State plan or tribal plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For bioreactors that are located at existing affected sources, but do not initiate liquids addition until later than the compliance date in Sec. 63.1947(b) of this subpart, you must submit the initial semiannual compliance report and performance tests results described in 40 CFR 60.757(f) within 180 days after the date you are required to begin operating the gas collection and control system by Sec. 63.1947(c) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you must submit a semiannual compliance report for a bioreactor as well as a semiannual compliance report for a conventional portion of the same landfill, you may delay submittal of a subsequent semiannual compliance report for the bioreactor according to paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section so that the reports may be submitted on the same schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After submittal of your initial semiannual compliance report and performance test results for the bioreactor, you may delay submittal of the subsequent semiannual compliance report for the bioreactor until the date the initial or subsequent semiannual compliance report is due for the conventional portion of your landfill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may delay submittal of your subsequent semiannual compliance report by no more than 12 months after the due date for submitting the initial semiannual compliance report and performance test results described in 40 CFR 60.757(f) for the bioreactor. The report shall cover the time period since the previous semiannual report for the bioreactor, which would be a period of at least 6 months and no more than 12 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After the delayed semiannual report, all subsequent semiannual reports for the bioreactor must be submitted every 6 months on the same date the semiannual report for the conventional portion of the landfill is due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you add any liquids other than leachate in a controlled fashion to the waste mass and do not comply with the bioreactor requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.1947, 63.1955(c) and 63.1980(c) through (f) of this subpart, you must keep a record of calculations showing that the percent moisture by weight expected in the waste mass to which liquid is added is less than 40 percent. The calculation must consider the waste mass, moisture content of the incoming waste, mass of water added to the waste including leachate recirculation and other liquids addition and precipitation, and the mass of water removed through leachate or other water losses.

Moisture level sampling or mass balances calculations can be used. You must document the calculations and the basis of any assumptions. Keep the record of the calculations until you cease liquids addition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you calculate moisture content to establish the date your bioreactor is required to begin operating the collection and control system under Sec. 63.1947(a)(2) or (c)(2), keep a record of the calculations including the information specified in paragraph (g) of this section for 5 years. Within 90 days after the bioreactor achieves 40 percent moisture content, report the results of the calculation, the date the bioreactor achieved 40 percent moisture content by weight, and the date you plan to begin collection and control system operation.</p><p class="depth2">Other Requirements and Information</p>
