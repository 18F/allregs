                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each full-power commercial and noncommercial educational  television broadcast station licensee or permittee must air an  educational campaign about the transition from analog broadcasting to  digital television (DTV). For each such commercial station, a licensee  or permittee must elect by March 27, 2008, to comply with either  paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. For each such noncommercial  station, a licensee or permittee must elect, by March 27, 2008, to  comply with paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section. A licensee or  permittee must note their election via the filing of Form 388 as  required by Sec. Sec.  73.3526 and 73.3527.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following requirements apply to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e)  of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The station must comply with the requirements of the paragraph  it elects with respect to its analog channel and its primary digital  stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Public Service Announcement aired to comply with these  requirements must be closed-captioned, notwithstanding Sec.  79.1(d)(6)  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The campaign must begin no later than March 27, 2008, and  continue at least through the station's termination of analog service,  not later than June 12, 2009, except for stations subject to the  provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any station that has filed a request for an extension of the  deadline for construction of its full, authorized post-transition  digital facility, including a request for phased transition pursuant to  the Third DTV Periodic Report and Order in MB Docket 07-91, or is  operating under such an extension, must continue its DTV consumer  education campaign until the station completes construction of its full,  authorized post-transition digital facility. After the station  terminates analog service, it must continue to comply with the  requirements of the Consumer Education Campaign Option that it has  elected, except that the content of all on-air education must be revised  to provide information about the station's limited digital service area  and the anticipated date for it to complete construction and commence  operation of its full, authorized post-transition digital facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Service loss notices--Beginning April 1, 2009, if the FCC's  Signal Loss Report, available on http://www.dtv.gov, predicts that 2  percent or more of the population in a station's Grade B analog service  contour will not receive the station's digital signal, the station must  air service loss notices, as provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Service loss notices may be no fewer than 30 seconds long, and  must be aired at least once per day, between 8 a.m. and 11:35 p.m. At  least three service loss notices per week must air between 8 p.m. and 11  p.m. in the Atlantic, Eastern and Pacific time zones,   and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the Mountain, Central, and Alaskan  time zones.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Service loss notices are in addition to the other obligations  imposed by this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The service loss notices must include the FCC's Call Center  number, 1-888-CALL-FCC, the FCC's TTY number, 1-888-TELL-FCC, and the  Web site address for the FCC's online digital reception mapping tool,  http://www.DTV.gov/maps.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The station must post service loss information on its Web site  home page, including a link to the relevant coverage change maps on  http://www.DTV.gov and the FCC's online digital reception mapping tool,  http://www.DTV.gov/maps. This information must remain available on the  station's Web site home page for at least 30 days after the station  terminates its analog service, notwithstanding the termination of other  consumer education requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The loss areas disclosed in the service loss notices must be  based on the FCC's Signal Loss Report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Service loss notices must disclose that some current viewers of  the station's analog signal are predicted to experience a loss of  service and describe the discrete geographic areas where there is likely  to be a service loss.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If any predicted service loss is attributable to a change in  the station's frequency from VHF to UHF, and the predicted losses cannot  entirely be described with respect to discrete geographic areas, the  station must, at a minimum, disclose that some analog viewers located in  areas obstructed by hills or buildings are predicted to be unable to  receive the station's digital signal. This is in addition to, and not in  lieu of, descriptions of any discrete geographic areas where there is  likely to be a service loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Antenna information notices--Beginning April 1, 2009, all  stations must include information about the use of antennas as part of  their consumer education campaign, as provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The antenna information notices should provide information about  the types of antennas that their viewers may need, and how to install  them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stations that have changed or are changing the frequency band  in which they broadcast must inform their viewers of the change in  frequencies and explain how the change affects the antenna they need to  receive their signal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stations that are predicted by the FCC's Signal Loss Report to  have any loss of viewers should consider whether their viewers can  improve their ability to receive their signal by obtaining a different  or better antenna, and if so, provide information concerning such  antennas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Antenna information notices must be no fewer than 15 seconds  long, and must be aired at least once per day, between 8 a.m. and 11:35  p.m. At least three antenna information notices per week must air  between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. in the Atlantic, Eastern and Pacific time  zones, and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the Mountain, Central, and  Alaskan time zones.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Antenna information notices may be included as part of a  station's DTV Consumer Education Initiative efforts, or may be discussed  for at least 15 seconds during news programs, or broadcast in other ways  that the station determines will be most helpful to consumers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Notwithstanding the content requirements of paragraph (c) of  this section, a licensee or permittee electing compliance with paragraph  (c) of this section may replace up to 25 percent of their daily PSAs and  crawls with antenna notices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Rescanning notices--Beginning April 1, 2009, all stations must  include information in their consumer education campaigns to inform and  remind viewers about the importance of periodically using the rescan  function of their digital televisions and digital converter boxes, as  provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rescanning notices should explain why rescanning is important in  general and, in particular, if the station is changing channels or  signal direction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rescanning notices must be no fewer than 15 seconds long, and  must be aired at least once per day, between   8 a.m. and 11:35 p.m. At least three rescanning notices per week must  air between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. in the Atlantic, Eastern and Pacific time  zones, and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the Mountain, Central, and  Alaskan time zones.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rescanning notices may be included as part of a station's DTV  Consumer Education Initiative efforts, or may be discussed for at least  15 seconds during news programs, or broadcast in other ways that the  station determines will be most helpful to consumers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Notwithstanding the content requirements of paragraph (c) of  this section, a licensee or permittee electing compliance with paragraph  (c) of this section may replace up to 25 percent of their daily PSAs and  crawls with rescanning notices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Help center notices--Beginning April 1, 2009, as part of its DTV  consumer education campaign, every station must air notices providing  the location and operating hours of walk-in DTV help centers in the  station's market area; the FCC Call Center telephone number and TTY  number; and the station's telephone number for receiving consumer  referrals and calls from local viewers, as provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Help center notices must be no fewer than 15 seconds long, and  must be aired at least once per day, between 8 a.m. and 11:35 p.m. At  least three help center notices per week must air between 8 p.m. and 11  p.m. in the Atlantic, Eastern and Pacific time zones, and between 7 p.m.  and 10 p.m. in the Mountain, Central, and Alaskan time zones.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Help center notices may be included as part of a station's DTV  Consumer Education Initiative efforts, or may be discussed for at least  15 seconds during news programs, or broadcast in other ways that the  station determines will be most helpful to consumers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the content requirements of paragraph (c) of  this section, a licensee or permittee electing compliance with paragraph  (c) of this section may replace up to 25 percent of its daily PSAs and  crawls with help center notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consumer Education Campaign Option One:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From March 27, 2008 through the station's termination of analog  service or, for stations subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)  of this section, until the station completes construction of its full,  authorized post-transition digital facility, a licensee or permittee  must, at a minimum, air one transition-related public service  announcement (PSA), and one transition-related informative text crawl,  in every quarter of every broadcast day. This minimum will increase to  two of each, per quarter, from April 1, 2008 through September 30, 2008,  and to three of each, per quarter, from October 1, 2008 through the  conclusion of the campaign. At least one PSA and one informative text  crawl per day must be aired between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. in the Atlantic,  Eastern and Pacific time zones, and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the  Mountain, Central, and Alaskan time zones.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of this section, each broadcast day consists of  four quarters; 6:01 a.m. to 12 p.m., 12:01 p.m. to 6 p.m., 6:01 p.m. to  12 a.m., and 12:01 a.m. to 6 a.m.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Informative text crawls must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Air during programming;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air for no fewer than 60 consecutive seconds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be displayed so that the text travels across the bottom or top  of the viewing area at the same speed used for other informative text  crawls concerning news, sports, and entertainment information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be presented in the same language as a majority of the  programming carried by the station;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Be displayed so that they do not block and are not blocked by  closed-captioning or emergency information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Contain at least the following information, but may contain  more, provided they contain no misleading or inaccurate statements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nationwide switch to digital television broadcasting will be  complete on June 12, 2009, but your local television stations may switch  sooner. After the switch, analog-only television sets that receive TV  programming through an antenna will need a converter box to continue to  receive   over-the-air TV. Watch your local stations to find out when they will  turn off their analog signal and switch to digital-only broadcasting.  Analog-only TVs should continue to work as before to receive low power,  Class A or translator television stations and with cable and satellite  TV services, gaming consoles, VCRs, DVD players, and similar products.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> More information is available by phone and online, and provide  appropriate contact information, including means of contacting the  station or the network.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public service announcements must have a duration of no fewer  than 15 consecutive seconds, and contain, at a minimum, the information  described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section.
