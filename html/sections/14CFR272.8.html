If the carrier is already receiving compensation pursuant to Sec. 272.9 of this part, the Department will continue to direct payment of such compensation during any period the carrier is required to maintain service. Such payments shall be made by the Department of Interior from funds appropriated for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department will review its order from time to time and will revise the level of required service as necessary to maintain only the level of essential air service determined by the Department for that place, considering all other service to such place in accordance with Sec. 272.6(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the period any such air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier is required to maintain service under this section, the Department will make every effort to obtain alternative service, with compensation if necessary, as required to maintain essential air service to such place.
