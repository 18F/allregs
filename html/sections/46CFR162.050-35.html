The ppm display is recorded and a sample of the mixture causing actuation of the alarm is taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the alarm has a positive displacement mixture pump, the mixture pressure is reduced to one-half of the alarm's maximum design pressure. If the alarm has a centrifugal mixture pump or is not equipped with a mixture pump, the mixture flow rate is reduced to one-half of the alarm's maximum design flow rate. After reduction of pressure or flow rate, the oil content in the mixture is increased until the alarm actuates. The ppm display is recorded and a sample of the mixture causing actuation of the alarm is taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the alarm has a positive displacement mixture pump, the influent pressure is increased to twice the alarm's minimum design pressure. If the alarm has a centrifugal mixture

pump or if the alarm is not equipped with a mixture pump, the influent flow rate is increased to twice the alarm's maximum design flow rate. After increasing the pressure or flow rate, the oil content in the mixture is increased until the alarm actuates. The ppm display is recorded and a sample of the mixture causing actuation is taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test No. 4A Shutoff Test.

Samples of the mixture must be taken at the beginning of the test and at 2-hour intervals until the completion of the 8-hour period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following the steps in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the bilge alarm must be run on clean, oil-free water only and any zero drift must be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Test No. 7A Response Time Test. (1) The bilge alarm is fed with a 40 ppm mixture of Test Fluid B and water until the bilge alarm actuates. The time of turning on the metering pump of the test rig and the time of alarm actuation are recorded. The flow rate on the flow meter of the test rig is also recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bilge alarm is fed with a 40 ppm mixture of Test Fluid B and water until the bilge alarm actuates.
