The grantee assures that it will undertake an affirmative action program, as required by 14 CFR part 152, subpart E, to ensure that no person shall, on the grounds of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex, be excluded from participating in any employment, contracting, or leasing activities covered in 14 CFR part 152, subpart E. The grantee assures that no person shall be excluded, on these grounds, from participating in or receiving the services or benefits of any program or activity covered by this subpart. The grantee assures that it will require that its covered organizations provide assurances to the grantee that they similarly will undertake affirmative action programs and that they will require assurances from their suborganizations, as required by 14 CFR part 152, subpart E, to the same effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assurance. The grantee agrees to comply with any affirmative action plan or steps for equal employment opportunity required by 14 CFR part 152, subpart E, as part of the affirmative action program, and by any Federal, State, or local agency or court, including those resulting from a conciliation agreement, a consent decree, court order, or similar mechanism. The grantee agrees that State or local affirmative action plans will be used in lieu of any affirmative action plan or steps required by 14 CFR part 152, subpart E, only when they fully meet the standards set forth in 14 CFR 152.409. The grantee agrees to obtain a similar assurance from its covered organizations, and to cause them to require a similar assurance of their covered suborganizations, as required by 14 CFR part 152, subpart E.</p>
