                            <p class="depth0">Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for  resolving cases of blanketing interference in accordance with the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees  must resolve any cases of blanketing interference in their area of  responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one- year period following commencement of service from new or modified  transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the  complainant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate  vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where the field  strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or  exceeds 115 dB[micro]V/m. To determine the radial distance to the  boundary of this area, the following formula must be used: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.007  where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts   The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without  consideration of the antenna's vertical radiation pattern or height,  must be used in the formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to  mobile receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing interference occurring  as a result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly  installed consumer antenna systems, or the use of high gain antennas or  antenna booster amplifiers by consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where  there are already one or more transmitting antennas are responsible for  resolving any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting  antennas at the same location are jointly responsible for resolving  blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine  which station is causing the interference, in which case the licensee of  that station is held fully responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After the one year period of responsibility to resolve  blanketing interference, licensees must provide upon request technical  information to complainants on remedies for blanketing interference.</p>
