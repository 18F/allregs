                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Action to enforce compliance. When the Secretary acts to enforce  the civil rights provisions of Section 109, as described in Sec.   570.602 and 24 CFR part 6, the procedures described in 24 CFR parts 6  and 180 apply. If the Secretary finds, after reasonable notice and  opportunity for hearing, that a recipient has failed to comply  substantially with any other provisions of this part, the provisions of  this section apply. The Secretary, until he/she is satisfied that there  is no longer any such failure to comply, shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terminate payments to the recipient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduce payments to the recipient by an amount equal to the  amount of such payments which were not expended in accordance with this  part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limit the availability of payments to programs or activities not  affected by such failure to comply.</p><p class="depth0">Provided, however, that the Secretary may on due notice suspend  payments   at any time after the issuance of a notice of opportunity for hearing  pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, pending such hearing and a  final decision, to the extent the Secretary determines such action  necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities  affected by such failure to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of, or in addition to, any action authorized by  paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may, if he/she has reason  to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any  provision of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States  with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil  action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such  relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount  of the assistance furnished under this part which was not expended in  accordance with it, or for mandatory or injunctive relief;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proceedings. When the Secretary proposes to take action pursuant  to this section, the respondent is the unit of general local government  or State receiving assistance under this part. These procedures are to  be followed prior to imposition of a sanction described in paragraph (a)  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notice of opportunity for hearing: The Secretary shall notify  the respondent in writing of the proposed action and of the opportunity  for a hearing. The notice shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specify, in a manner which is adequate to allow the respondent  to prepare its response, allegations with respect to a failure to comply  substantially with a provision of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State that the hearing procedures are governed by these rules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State that a hearing may be requested within 10 days from  receipt of the notice and the name, address and telephone number of the  person to whom any request for hearing is to be addressed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the action which the Secretary proposes to take and  that the authority for this action is section 111(a) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> State that if the respondent fails to request a hearing within  the time specified a decision by default will be rendered against the  respondent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Be sent to the respondent by certified mail, return receipt  requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initiation of hearing. The respondent shall be allowed at least  10 days from receipt of the notice within which to notify HUD of its  request for a hearing. If no request is received within the time  specified, the Secretary may proceed to make a finding on the issue of  compliance with this part and to take the proposed action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative Law Judge. Proceedings conducted under these  rules shall be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),  appointed as provided by section 11 of the Administrative Procedures Act  (5 U.S.C. 3105). The case shall be referred to the ALJ by the Secretary  at the time a hearing is requested. The ALJ shall promptly notify the  parties of the time and place at which the hearing will be held. The ALJ  shall conduct a fair and impartial hearing and take all action necessary  to avoid delay in the disposition of proceedings and to maintain order.  The ALJ shall have all powers necessary to those ends, including but not  limited to the power to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Issue subpoenas as authorized by law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Order or limit discovery prior to the hearing as the interests  of justice may require;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the  parties and their counsel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the  issues by consent of the parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Consider and rule upon all procedural and other motions  appropriate in adjudicative proceedings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Make and file initial determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ex parte communications.

Ex parte communications are prohibited  except where the purpose and content of the communication have been  disclosed in advance or simultaneously to all parties, or the  communication is a request for information concerning the status of the  case. Any ALJ who receives an ex parte communication which the ALJ knows  or has reason to believe is unauthorized shall promptly place the  communication, or its substance, in all files and shall furnish copies  to all parties. Unauthorized ex parte communications shall not be taken  into consideration in deciding any matter in issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The hearing. All parties shall have the right to be represented  at the hearing by counsel. The ALJ shall conduct the proceedings in an  expeditious manner while allowing the parties to present all oral and  written evidence which tends to support their respective positions, but  the ALJ shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious  evidence. The Department has the burden of proof in showing by a  preponderance of the evidence that the respondent failed to comply  substantially with a provision of this part. Each party shall be allowed  to cross-examine adverse witnesses and to rebut and comment upon  evidence presented by the other party. Hearings shall be open to the  public. So far as the orderly conduct of the hearing permits, interested  persons other than the parties may appear and participate in the  hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Transcripts. Hearing shall be recorded and transcribed only by a  reporter under the supervision of the ALJ. The orginal transcript shall  be a part of the record and shall constitute the sole official  transcript.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ  shall give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit proposed  findings and conclusions and supporting reasons therefor. Within 25 days  after the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ shall prepare a written  decision which includes a statement of findings and conclusions, and the  reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law or  discretion presented on the record and the appropriate sanction or  denial thereof. The decision shall be based on consideration of the  whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by  and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial  evidence. A copy of the decision shall be furnished to the parties  immediately by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall  include a notice that any requests for review by the Secretary must be  made in writing to the Secretary within 30 days of the receipt of the  decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The record. The transcript of testimony and exhibits, together  with the decision of the ALJ and all papers and requests filed in the  proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision and, on  payment of its reasonable cost, shall be made available to the parties.  After reaching his/her initial decision, the ALJ shall certify to the  complete record and forward the record to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Review by the Secretary. The decision by the ALJ shall  constitute the final decision of the Secretary unless, within 30 days  after the receipt of the decision, either the respondent or the  Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development files an  exception and request for review by the Secretary. The excepting party  must transmit simultaneously to the Secretary and the other party the  request for review and the basis of the party's exceptions to the  findings of the ALJ. The other party shall be allowed 30 days from  receipt of the exception to provide the Secretary and the excepting  party with a written reply. The Secretary shall then review the record  of the case, including the exceptions and the reply. On the basis of  such review, the Secretary shall issue a written determination,  including a statement of the reasons or basis therefor, affirming,  modifying or revoking the decision of the ALJ. The Secretary's decision  shall be made and transmitted to the parties within 80 days after the  decision of the ALJ was furnished to the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Judicial review.

[53 FR 34466, Sept. 6, 1988, as amended at 64 FR 3802, Jan. 25, 1999]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 570--Guidelines and Objectives for Evaluating</p><p class="depth0">Project Costs and Financial Requirements</p><p class="depth0">I. Guidelines and Objectives for Evaluating Project Costs and  Financial Requirements. HUD has developed the following guidelines that  are designed to provide the recipient with a framework for financially  underwriting and selecting CDBG-assisted economic development projects  which are financially viable and will make the most effective use of the  CDBG funds. The use of these underwriting guidelines as published by HUD  is not mandatory. However, grantees electing not to use these  underwriting guidelines would be expected to conduct basic financial  underwriting prior to the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a  for-profit business. States electing not to use these underwriting  guidelines would be expected to ensure that the state or units of  general local government conduct basic financial underwriting prior to  the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a for-profit business.</p><p class="depth0">II. Where appropriate, HUD's underwriting guidelines recognize that  different levels of review are appropriate to take into account  differences in the size and scope of a proposed project, and in the case  of a microenterprise or other small business to take into account the  differences in the capacity and level of sophistication among businesses  of differing sizes.</p><p class="depth0">III. Recipients are encouraged, when they develop their own programs  and underwriting criteria, to also take these factors into account. For  example, a recipient administering a program providing only technical  assistance to small businesses might choose to apply underwriting  guidelines to the technical assistance program as a whole, rather than  to each instance of assistance to a business. Given the nature and  dollar value of such a program, a recipient might choose to limit its  evaluation to factors such as the extent of need for this type of  assistance by the target group of businesses and the extent to which  this type of assistance is already available.</p><p class="depth0">IV. The objectives of the underwriting guidelines are to ensure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> that project costs are reasonable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> that all sources of project financing are committed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> that to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are not substituted  for non-Federal financial support;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> that the project is financially feasible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> that to the extent practicable, the return on the owner's equity  investment will not be unreasonably high; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> that to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are disbursed on a  pro rata basis with other finances provided to the project.</p><p class="depth0">i. Project costs are reasonable. i. Reviewing costs for  reasonableness is important. It will help the recipient avoid providing  either too much or too little CDBG assistance for the proposed project.  Therefore, it is suggested that the grantee obtain a breakdown of all  project costs and that each cost element making up the project be  reviewed for reasonableness. The amount of time and resources the  recipient expends evaluating the reasonableness of a cost element should  be commensurate with its cost. For example, it would be appropriate for  an experienced reviewer looking at a cost element of less than $10,000  to judge the reasonableness of that cost based upon his or her knowledge  and common sense. For a cost element in excess of $10,000, it would be  more appropriate for the reviewer to compare the cost element with a  third-party, fair-market price quotation for that cost element. Third- party price quotations may also be used by a reviewer to help determine  the reasonableness of cost elements below $10,000 when the reviewer  evaluates projects infrequently or if the reviewer is less experienced  in cost estimations. If a recipient does not use third-party price  quotations to verify cost elements, then the recipient would need to  conduct its own cost analysis using appropriate cost estimating manuals  or services.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The recipient should pay particular attention to any cost  element of the project that will be carried out through a non-arms- length transaction. A non-arms-length transaction occurs when the entity  implementing the CDBG assisted activity procures goods or services from  itself or from another party with whom there is a financial interest or  family relationship. If abused, non-arms-length transactions  misrepresent the true cost of the project.</p><p class="depth0">2. Commitment of all project sources of financing. The recipient  should review all projected sources of financing necessary to carry out  the economic development project. This is to ensure that time and effort  is not wasted on assessing a proposal that is not able to proceed. To  the extent practicable, prior to the commitment of CDBG funds to the  project, the recipient should verify that: sufficient sources of funds  have been identified to finance the project; all participating parties  providing those funds have affirmed their intention to make the funds  available; and the participating parties have the financial capacity to  provide the funds.</p><p class="depth0">3. Avoid substitution of CDBG funds for non-Federal financial  support. i. The recipient should review the economic development   project to ensure that, to the extent practicable, CDBG funds will not  be used to substantially reduce the amount of non-Federal financial  support for the activity. This will help the recipient to make the most  efficient use of its CDBG funds for economic development. To reach this  determination, the recipient's reviewer would conduct a financial  underwriting analysis of the project, including reviews of appropriate  projections of revenues, expenses, debt service and returns on equity  investments in the project. The extent of this review should be  appropriate for the size and complexity of the project and should use  industry standards for similar projects, taking into account the unique  factors of the project such as risk and location.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Because of the high cost of underwriting and processing loans,  many private financial lenders do not finance commercial projects that  are less than $100,000. A recipient should familiarize itself with the  lending practices of the financial institutions in its community. If the  project's total cost is one that would normally fall within the range  that financial institutions participate, then the recipient should  normally determine the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Private debt financing--whether or not the participating private,  for-profit business (or other entity having an equity interest) has  applied for private debt financing from a commercial lending institution  and whether that institution has completed all of its financial  underwriting and loan approval actions resulting in either a firm  commitment of its funds or a decision not to participate in the project;  and</p><p class="depth0">B. Equity participation--whether or not the degree of equity  participation is reasonable given general industry standards for rates  of return on equity for similar projects with similar risks and given  the financial capacity of the entrepreneur(s) to make additional  financial investments.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the recipient is assisting a microenterprise owned by a low-  or moderate-income person(s), in conducting its review under this  paragraph, the recipient might only need to determine that non-Federal  sources of financing are not available (at terms appropriate for such  financing) in the community to serve the low- or moderate-income  entrepreneur.</p><p class="depth0">4. Financial feasibility of the project. i. The public benefit a  grantee expects to derive from the CDBG assisted project (the subject of  separate regulatory standards) will not materialize if the project is  not financially feasible. To determine if there is a reasonable chance  for the project's success, the recipient should evaluate the financial  viability of the project. A project would be considered financially  viable if all of the assumptions about the project's market share, sales  levels, growth potential, projections of revenue, project expenses and  debt service (including repayment of the CDBG assistance if appropriate)  were determined to be realistic and met the project's break-even point  (which is generally the point at which all revenues are equal to all  expenses). Generally speaking, an economic development project that does  not reach this break-even point over time is not financially feasible.  The following should be noted in this regard:</p><p class="depth0">A. some projects make provisions for a negative cash flow in the  early years of the project while space is being leased up or sales  volume built up, but the project's projections should take these factors  into account and provide sources of financing for such negative cash  flow; and</p><p class="depth0">B. it is expected that a financially viable project will also  project sufficient revenues to provide a reasonable return on equity  investment. The recipient should carefully examine any project that is  not economically able to provide a reasonable return on equity  investment. Under such circumstances, a business may be overstating its  real equity investment (actual costs of the project may be overstated as  well), or it may be overstating some of the project's operating expenses  in the expectation that the difference will be taken out as profits, or  the business may be overly pessimistic in its market share and revenue  projections and has downplayed its profits.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In addition to the financial underwriting reviews carried out  earlier, the recipient should evaluate the experience and capacity of  the assisted business owners to manage an assisted business to achieve  the projections. Based upon its analysis of these factors, the recipient  should identify those elements, if any, that pose the greatest risks  contributing to the project's lack of financial feasibility.</p><p class="depth0">5. Return on equity investment. To the extent practicable, the CDBG  assisted activity should provide not more than a reasonable return on  investment to the owner of the assisted activity. This will help ensure  that the grantee is able to maximize the use of its CDBG funds for its  economic development objectives. However, care should also be taken to  avoid the situation where the owner is likely to receive too small a  return on his/her investment, so that his/her motivation remains high to  pursue the business with vigor. The amount, type and terms of the CDBG  assistance should be adjusted to allow the owner a reasonable return on  his/her investment given industry rates of return for that investment,  local conditions and the risk of the project.</p><p class="depth0">6. Disbursement of CDBG funds on a pro rata basis. To the extent  practicable, CDBG funds used to finance economic development activities  should be disbursed on a pro rata basis with other funding sources.  Recipients should be guided by the principle of not placing CDBG funds  at significantly greater risk   than non-CDBG funds. This will help avoid the situation where it is  learned that a problem has developed that will block the completion of  the project, even though all or most of the CDBG funds going in to the  project have already been expended. When this happens, a recipient may  be put in a position of having to provide additional financing to  complete the project or watch the potential loss of its funds if the  project is not able to be completed. When the recipient determines that  it is not practicable to disburse CDBG funds on a pro rata basis, the  recipient should consider taking other steps to safeguard CDBG funds in  the event of a default, such as insisting on securitizing assets of the  project.
