                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Corroded surfaces in the calking edges of circumferential seams  may be built up by welding to the original thickness under the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The thickness of the original metal to be built up between the  rivet holes and the calking edge shall not be less than one-fourth of  the diameter of the rivet hole, and the portion of the calking edge to  be thus reinforced shall not exceed 30 inches in length in a  circumferential direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In all repairs to circumferential seams by welding, the rivets  shall be removed over the portions to be welded for a distance of at  least 6 inches beyond the repaired portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After repairs are made the rivet holes shall be reamed before  the rivets are redriven.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is not permissible to build up or reinforce a grooved or  corroded area of unstayed internal surfaces by means of welding, except  that widely scattered pit holes may be built up by welding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where external corrosion has reduced the thickness of flat  plates around hand holes to an extent of not more than 40 percent of the  original thickness and for a distance not exceeding 2 inches from the  edge of the hole, the plate may be built up by welding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where stayed sheets have corroded to a depth not exceeding 40  percent of their original thickness, they may be reinforced or built up  by welding. Where the staybolts are fitted with riveted heads, the  staybolts in the reinforced area shall be renewed in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 52.20-15 of this subchapter, but where the staybolts  are fitted with nuts, the nuts may be removed and after reinforcing has  been applied, collars may be welded around the staybolts in lieu of the  nuts. Such reinforced areas shall not exceed 400 square inches nor more  than 30 inches in one direction. Two such areas in any one plate may be  reinforced: Provided, that the distance between the reinforced surfaces  is not less than 30 inches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the corroded portion of a staybolted surface exceeds 400  square inches, it is permissible to make repairs by cutting out the  defective portion and replacing it with a new plate, the edges of the  new plate to be welded in position. In such cases, new staybolts shall  be fitted in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 52.20-15 of this  subchapter and where welding is performed through a line of staybolts,  welded collars as required by Figure 52.01-3 of this subchapter shall be  used to attach the staybolts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eroded seams of welded pressure vessels may be repaired by  rewelding the wasted portion. The wasted section of the seam shall be  excavated sufficiently by grinding, flame or arc gouging or chipping to  ensure proper weld penetration. Rewelded seams shall be nondestructively  tested in accordance with section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure  Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 59.01-2).
