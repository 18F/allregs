                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the Corporation receives a FOIA request seeking the release of a submitter's grant application(s), or portions thereof, the Corporation shall provide prompt written notice of the request to the submitter in order to afford the submitter with an opportunity to object to the disclosure of the requested grant application(s) (or any portion thereof). The notice shall reasonably describe the grant application(s), or portions thereof, requested and inform the submitter of the process required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a submitter who has received notice of a request for the submitter's grant application(s) desires to object to the disclosure of the grant application(s) (or any portion thereof), the

submitter must identify the information for which disclosure is objected and provide LSC with a written detailed statement to that effect. The statement must be submitted to the FOIA Officer in the Office of Legal Affairs and must specify the grounds for withholding the information under FOIA or this Part. In particular, the submitter must demonstrate why the information is commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. The submitter's statement must be provided to LSC within seven business days of the date of the notice from the Corporation. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice from LSC within that time, LSC will deem the submitter to have no objection to the disclosure of the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of written objection to disclosure by a submitter, LSC shall consider the submitter's objections and specific grounds for withholding in deciding whether to release the disputed information. Whenever LSC decides to disclose information over the objection of the submitter, LSC shall give the submitter written notice which shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the information to be released and a notice that LSC intends to release the information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the reason(s) why the submitter's request for withholding is being rejected; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice that the submitter shall have 5 business days from the date of the notice of proposed release to appeal that decision to the LSC President, whose decision shall be final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> LSC determines upon initial review of the requested grant application(s), or portions thereof, the requested information should not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been previously published or officially made available to the public; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than FOIA) or LSC regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of a submitter's information, LSC shall promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever LSC provides a submitter with notice and opportunity to oppose disclosure under this section, LSC shall notify the requester that the submitter's rights process under this section has been triggered. Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of the submitter's information, LSC shall notify the requester.
