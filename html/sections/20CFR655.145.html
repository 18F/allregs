                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Increases in number of workers. The Application for Temporary  Employment Certification may be amended at any time before the CO's  certification determination to increase the number of workers requested  in the initial Application for Temporary Employment Certification by not  more than 20 percent (50 percent for employers requesting less than 10  workers) without requiring an additional recruitment period for U.S.  workers. Requests for increases above the percent prescribed, without  additional recruitment, may be approved by the CO only when the employer  demonstrates that the need for additional workers could not have been  foreseen, and the crops or commodities will be in jeopardy prior to the  expiration of an additional recruitment period. All requests for  increasing the number of workers must be made in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minor changes to the period of employment. The Application for  Temporary Employment Certification may be amended to make minor changes  in the total period of employment. Changes will not be effective until  submitted in writing and approved by the CO. In considering whether to  approve the request, the CO will review the reason(s) for the request,  determine whether the reason(s) are on the whole justified, and take  into account the effect any change(s) would have on the adequacy of the  underlying test of the domestic labor market for the job opportunity. An  employer must demonstrate that the change to the period of employment  could not have been foreseen, and the crops or commodities will be in  jeopardy prior to the expiration of an additional recruitment period. If  the request is for a delay in the start date and is made after workers  have departed for the employer's place of work, the CO may only approve  the change if the employer includes with the request a written assurance  signed and dated by the employer that all workers who are already  traveling to the job site will be provided housing and subsistence,  without cost to the workers, until work commences. Upon acceptance of an  amendment, the CO will submit to the SWA any necessary modification to  the job order.</p><p class="depth2">Post-Acceptance Requirements</p>
