                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal law enforcement officials who encounter alien victims of  severe forms of trafficking in persons who are potential witnesses to  that trafficking may request that the Immigration and Naturalization  Service (INS) grant the continued presence of such aliens in the United  States. All law enforcement requests for continued presence must be  submitted to the INS, Headquarters Office of Field Operations, in  accordance with INS procedures. Each federal law enforcement agency will  designate a headquarters office to administer submissions and coordinate  with the INS on all requests for continued presence. The designated  headquarters office will be responsible for meeting all reporting  requirements contained in INS procedures for the processing and  administering of the requests for continued presence in the United  States of eligible aliens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving a request, the INS will determine the victim's  immigration status. When applicable and appropriate, the INS may then  use a variety of statutory and administrative mechanisms to ensure the  alien's continued presence in the United States. The specific mechanism  used will depend on the alien's current status under the immigration  laws and other relevant facts. These mechanisms may include parole,  voluntary departure, stay of final order, section 107(c)(3)-based  deferred action, or any other authorized form of continued presence,  including applicable nonimmigrant visas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alien's continued presence in the United States under this  subpart does not convey any immigration status or benefit apart from  that already encompassed by the particular form of authorized continued  presence granted. In most circumstances, victims granted continued  presence will be eligible for temporary employment authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The continued presence granted through any of the mechanisms  described in this paragraph (b) will contain the terms normally  associated with the particular type of authorized continued presence  granted, including, but not limited to, duration of benefit, terms and  procedures for receiving an extension, travel limitations, and  employment authorization unless expressly waived in an individual  approval. Aliens granted deferred action based upon section 107(c)(3)  are considered to be present in the United States pursuant to a period  of stay authorized by the Attorney General for purposes of INA sections  212(a)(9)(B)(I) and (C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases where it is determined that the granting to an alien  of continued presence in the United States poses a threat to national  security or to the safety and welfare of the public, the INS may require  the requesting agency to meet special conditions or requirements prior  to approval. The INS will promptly convey any such condition or  requirement to the requesting agency in writing. Upon agreement by the  requesting agency to comply with the conditions and accept the costs  associated with the implementation of those conditions, the INS will  grant the continued presence of the alien in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Although the INS and the requesting law enforcement agency will  make every effort to reach a satisfactory agreement for the granting of  continued presence, the INS may deny a request for continued presence in  the following instances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure, on the part of the requesting agency, to provide  necessary documentation or to adhere to established INS procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Refusal to agree or comply with conditions or requirements  instituted   in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure, on the part of the requesting agency, to comply with  past supervision or reporting requirements established as a condition of  continued presence; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When the INS determines that granting continued presence for  the particular alien would create a significant risk to national  security or public safety and that the risk cannot be eliminated or  acceptably minimized by the establishment of agreeable conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a denial, the INS shall promptly notify the  designated office within the requesting agency. The INS and the  requesting agency will take all available steps to reach an acceptable  resolution. In the event such resolution is not possible, the INS shall  promptly forward the matter to the Deputy Attorney General, or his  designee, for resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to meeting any conditions placed upon the granting  of continued presence in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section,  the responsible official at the law enforcement agency requesting the  victim's continued presence in the United States as described in  paragraph (a) of this section shall arrange for reasonable protection to  any alien allowed to remain in the United States by the INS. This  protection shall be in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 10606 and shall include  taking measures to protect trafficked persons and their family members  from intimidation, threats of reprisals, and reprisals from traffickers  and their associates in accordance with section 107(c)(3). Such  protection shall take into account their status as victims of severe  forms of trafficking in persons.</p>
