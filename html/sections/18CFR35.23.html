                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation Procedures. (1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making an abbreviated filing must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs.

If the filing does not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.
