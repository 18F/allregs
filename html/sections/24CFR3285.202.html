                            <p class="depth0">The soil classification and bearing capacity of the soil must be  determined before the foundation is constructed and anchored. The soil  classification and bearing capacity must be determined by one or more of  the following methods, unless the soil bearing capacity is established  as permitted in paragraph (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Soil tests. Soil tests that are in accordance with generally  accepted engineering practice; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Soil records. Soil records of the applicable LAHJ; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Soil classifications and bearing capacities. If the soil class  or bearing capacity cannot be determined by test or soil records, but  its type can be identified, the soil classification, allowable  pressures, and torque values shown in Table to Sec. 3285.202 may be  used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A pocket penetrometer; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of determining the soil bearing capacity by use of the  methods shown in the table, an allowable pressure of 1,500 psf may be  used, unless the site-specific information requires the use of lower  values based on soil classification and type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the soil appears to be composed of peat, organic clays, or  uncompacted fill, or appears to have unusual conditions, a registered  professional geologist, registered professional engineer, or registered  architect must determine the soil classification and maximum allowable  soil bearing capacity.</p><p class="depth2">Table to Sec. 3285.202 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Soil classification --------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">ASTM D 2487-00 or                             Allowable soil      Blow     Torque probe \3\</p><p class="depth2">D 2488-00          Soil description      bearing pressure     count    value \4\ (inch-</p><p class="depth2">Classification    (incorporated by                                 (psf) \1\       ASTM D        pounds)-</p><p class="depth2">number         reference, see                                                  1586-99</p><p class="depth2">Sec. 3285.4) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1................  ..................
