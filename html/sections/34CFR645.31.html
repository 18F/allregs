In determining need for an Upward Bound project, the Secretary reviews each type of project (Regular, Math and Science, or Veterans) using different need criteria. The criteria for each type of project contain the same maximum score of 24 points and read as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary evaluates the need for a Regular Upward Bound project in the proposed target area on the basis of information contained in the application which clearly demonstrates that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The income level of families in the target area is low;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The education attainment level of adults in the target area is low;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Target high school dropout rates are high;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> College-going rates in target high schools are low;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Student/counselor ratios in the target high schools are high; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Unaddressed academic, social and economic conditions in the target area pose serious problems for low-income, potentially first-generation college students.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary evaluates the need for an Upward Bound Math and Science Center in the proposed target area on the basis of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which student performance on standardized achievement and assessment tests in mathematics and science in the target area is lower than State or national norms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which potential participants attend schools in the target area that lack the resources and coursework that would help prepare persons for entry into postsecondary programs in mathematics, science, or engineering;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which such indicators as attendance data, dropout rates, college-going rates and student/counselor ratios in the target area indicate the importance of having additional educational opportunities available to low-income, first-generation students; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which there are eligible students in the target area who have demonstrated interest and capacity to pursue academic programs and careers in mathematics and science, and who could benefit from an Upward Bound Math and Science program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary evaluates the need for a Veterans Upward Bound project

in the proposed target area on the basis of clear evidence that shows--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposed target area lacks the services for eligible veterans that the applicant proposes to provide;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A large number of veterans who reside in the target area are low income and potential first generation college students;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A large number of veterans who reside in the target area who have not completed high school or, have completed high school but have not enrolled in a program of postsecondary education; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other indicators of need for a Veterans Upward Bound project, including the presence of unaddressed academic or socio-economic problems of veterans in the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objectives (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality of the applicant's objectives and proposed targets (percentages) in the following areas on the basis of the extent to which they are both ambitious, as related to the need data provided under paragraph (a) of this section, and attainable, given the project's plan of operation, budget, and other resources:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Regular Upward Bound and Upward Bound Math and Science Centers--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> (1 point) Academic performance (GPA);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> (1 point) Academic performance (standardized test scores);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> (2 points) Secondary school retention and graduation (with regular secondary school diploma);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> (1 point) Completion of rigorous secondary school program of study;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> (3 points) Postsecondary enrollment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> (1 point) Postsecondary completion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Veterans Upward Bound--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> (2 points) Academic performance (standardized test scores);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> (3 points) Education program retention and completion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> (3 points) Postsecondary enrollment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> (1 point) Postsecondary completion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Plan of operation (30 points).
