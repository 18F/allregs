                            <p class="depth0">The term other accounts, as used in section 815(a)(3) and paragraph  (b) of Sec. 1.815-2, means all amounts which are not specifically  included in the shareholders surplus account under section 815(b) and  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.815-3, or in the policyholders surplus account  under section 815(c) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.815-4. Thus, for  example, other accounts includes amounts representing the increase in  tax due to the operation of section 802(b)(3) which is not taken into  account for the taxable years 1959 and 1960 because of the special  transitional rule provided in section 802(a)(3) and Sec. 1.802-5,  earnings and profits accumulated prior to January 1, 1958, paid-in  surplus, capital, etc. To the extent that a distribution (or any portion  thereof) is treated as being made out of other accounts, no tax is  imposed on the company with respect to such distribution.
