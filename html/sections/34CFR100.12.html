                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this regulation applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this regulation, except that nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this regulation. Nothing in this regulation, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder, or any other regulations or instructions, insofar as such Order, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this regulation is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for Emergency School Assistance as published in 35 FR 13442 and codified as 34 CFR part 280.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forms and instructions. The responsible Department official shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supervision and coordination. The responsible Department official may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this regulation (other than responsibility for review as provided in Sec. 100.10(e)), including the achievements of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of title VI and this regulation to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or Agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this section shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.
