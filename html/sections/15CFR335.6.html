                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Not later than September 30 of each Tariff Rate Quota Year, a  Licensee that will not import the full quantity granted in a license  during the Tariff Rate Quota Year shall surrender the allocation that  will not be used to the Department for purposes of reallocation through  a written or electronic notice to the Department, including the license  control number and the amount being surrendered. The surrender shall be  final, and shall apply only to that Tariff Rate Quota Year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section, ``unused allocation'' means the  amount by which the quantity set forth in a license, including any  additional amount received pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section,  exceeds the quantity entered under the license, excluding any amount  surrendered pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department will notify Licensees of any amount surrendered  and the application period for requests for reallocation. A Licensee  that has imported, or intends to import, a quantity of Worsted Wool  Fabric exceeding the quantity set forth in its license may apply to  receive additional allocation from the amount to be reallocated. The  application shall state the maximum amount of additional allocation the  applicant will be able to use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amount surrendered will be reallocated to Licensees that  have applied for reallocation. The entire amount surrendered will be  reallocated pro-rata among applicants based on the applicant's share of  the annual allocation, but will not exceed the amount set forth in the  reallocation application as the maximum amount able to be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Licensee whose unused allocation in a Tariff Rate Quota Year  exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its license shall be  subject to having its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate  Quota Year. The subsequent Tariff Rate Quota Year allocation will be  reduced from the   quantity such Licensee would otherwise have received by a quantity equal  to 25 percent of its unused allocation from the prior year. A Licensee  whose unused allocation in two or more consecutive Tariff Rate Quota  Years exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its license  shall have its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate Quota  Year by a quantity equal to 50 percent of its unused allocation from the  prior year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No penalty will be imposed under paragraph (e) of this section  if the Licensee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department that  the unused allocation resulted from breach by a carrier of its contract  of carriage, breach by a supplier of its contract to supply the fabric,  act of God, or force majeure.
