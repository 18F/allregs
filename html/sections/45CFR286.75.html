TJSAs are areas delineated by the Census Bureau for each federally-recognized Tribe in Oklahoma without a reservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The TFAP must provide that a family receiving assistance under the plan may not receive duplicative assistance from other State or Tribal TANF programs and must include a description of the means by which the Tribe will ensure duplication does not occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The TFAP must identify the employment opportunities in and near the service area and the manner in which the Tribe will cooperate and participate in enhancing such opportunities for recipients of assistance under the plan, consistent with any applicable State standards. This should include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the employment opportunities available, in both the public and private sector, within and near the Tribal service area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of how the Tribe will work with public and private sector employers to enhance the opportunities available for Tribal TANF recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The TFAP must provide an assurance that the Tribe applies the fiscal accountability provisions of section 5(f)(1) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450c(f)(1)), relating to the submission of a single-agency audit report required by chapter 75 of title 31, United States Code.</p>
