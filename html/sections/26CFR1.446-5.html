                                Sec. 1.446-5  Debt issuance costs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>-5. If these costs are otherwise  deductible, they are deductible by the issuer over the term of the debt  as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Method of allocating debt issuance costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Solely  for purposes of determining the amount of debt   issuance costs that may be deducted in any period, these costs are  treated as if they adjusted the yield on the debt. To effect this, the  issuer treats the costs as if they decreased the issue price of the  debt. See Sec. 1.1273-2 to determine issue price. Thus, debt issuance  costs increase or create original issue discount and decrease or  eliminate bond issuance premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Original issue discount. Any resulting original issue discount  is taken into account by the issuer under the rules in Sec. 1.163-7,  which generally require the use of a constant yield method (as described  in Sec. 1.1272-1) to compute how much original issue discount is  deductible for a period. However, see Sec. 1.163-7(b) for special rules  that apply if the total original issue discount on the debt is de  minimis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bond issuance premium. Any remaining bond issuance premium is  taken into account by the issuer under the rules of Sec. 1.163-13, which  generally require the use of a constant yield method for purposes of  allocating bond issuance premium to accrual periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2004, X borrows $10,000,000. The  principal amount of the loan ($10,000,000) is repayable on December 31,  2008, and payments of interest in the amount of $500,000 are due on  December 31 of each year the loan is outstanding. X incurs debt issuance  costs of $130,000 to facilitate the borrowing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1273-2, the issue price of the loan is  $10,000,000. However, under paragraph (b) of this section, X reduces the  issue price of the loan by the debt issuance costs of $130,000,  resulting in an issue price of $9,870,000. As a result, X treats the  loan as having original issue discount in the amount of $130,000 (stated  redemption price at maturity of $10,000,000 minus the issue price of  $9,870,000). Because this amount of original issue discount is more than  the de minimis amount of original issue discount for the loan determined  under Sec. 1.1273-1(d) ($125,000 ($10,000,000 x .0025 x 5)), X must  allocate the original issue discount to each year based on the constant  yield method described in Sec. 1.1272-1(b). See Sec. 1.163-7(a). Based  on this method and a yield of 5.30%, compounded annually, the original  issue discount is allocable to each year as follows: $23,385 for 2004,  $24,625 for 2005, $25,931 for 2006, $27,306 for 2007, and $28,753 for  2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that X  incurs debt issuance costs of $120,000 rather than $130,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1273-2, the issue price of the loan is  $10,000,000. However, under paragraph (b) of this section, X reduces the  issue price of the loan by the debt issuance costs of $120,000,  resulting in an issue price of $9,880,000. As a result, X treats the  loan as having original issue discount in the amount of $120,000 (stated  redemption price at maturity of $10,000,000 minus the issue price of  $9,880,000). Because this amount of original issue discount is less than  the de minimis amount of original issue discount for the loan determined  under Sec. 1.1273-1(d) ($125,000), X does not have to use the constant  yield method described in Sec. 1.1272-1(b) to allocate the original  issue discount to each year. Instead, under Sec. 1.163-7(b)(2), X can  choose to allocate the original issue discount to each year on a  straight-line basis over the term of the loan or in proportion to the  stated interest payments ($24,000 each year). X also could choose to  deduct the original issue discount at maturity of the loan. X makes its  choice by reporting the original issue discount in a manner consistent  with the method chosen on X's timely filed federal income tax return for  2004. If X wanted to use the constant yield method, based on a yield of  5.279%, compounded annually, the original issue discount is allocable to  each year as follows: $21,596 for 2004, $22,736 for 2005, $23,937 for  2006, $25,200 for 2007, and $26,531 for 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies to debt issuance costs paid  or incurred for debt instruments issued on or after December 31, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Accounting method changes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consent to change. An issuer  required to change its method of accounting for debt issuance costs to  comply with this section must secure the consent of the Commissioner in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.446-1(e). Paragraph (e)(2) of  this section provides the Commissioner's automatic consent for certain  changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> applies provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The change is made to comply with this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The change is made for the first taxable year for which the  issuer must account for debt issuance costs under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The issuer attaches to its federal income tax return for the  taxable year containing the change a statement that it has changed its  method of accounting under this section.
