The respondent in the proceeding shall have 20 days in  which to file a countering affidavit or other evidence. If no evidence  countering the material assertions of the Administrator has been  submitted within 20 days, the Administrative Law Judge shall, within 30  days thereafter, affirm the revocation or denial of the certificate. If  the respondent does timely file such evidence, the Administrative Law  Judge shall schedule a hearing pursuant to Sec. 530.411(c) of this  subpart and the case shall be subject to the expeditious procedures  following therein.</p>
