                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition on increasing acreage limitation entitlements.  Except as specifically provided in these rules, a landholder cannot  increase acreage limitation entitlements or eligibility by acquiring or  holding a beneficial interest in a legal entity. Similarly, the acreage  limitation status of an individual or legal entity that holds or has  acquired a beneficial interest in another legal entity will not be  permitted to enlarge the latter legal entity's acreage limitation  entitlements or eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Attribution of owned land. For purposes of determining acreage  to be counted against acreage limitation entitlements, acreage will be  attributed to all:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct landowners in proportion to the direct beneficial  interest the landowners own in the land; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indirect landowners in proportion to the indirect beneficial  interest they own in the land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attribution of leased land. Leased land will be attributed to  the direct and indirect landowners as well as to the direct and indirect  lessees in the same manner as described in paragraphs (b) and (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attribution of land held through intermediate entities. If land  is held by a direct landholder and a series of indirect landholders,  Reclamation will attribute that land to the acreage limitation  entitlements of the direct landholder and each indirect landholder in  proportion to each landholder's beneficial interest in the entity that  directly holds the land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Leasebacks. Any land a landholder directly or indirectly owns  and that is directly or indirectly leased back will only count once  against that particular landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect on an entity of attribution to part owners. For purposes  of determining eligibility, the entire landholding will be attributed to  all the direct and indirect landholders. If the interests in a legal  entity are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Undivided, then all of the indirect part owners must be eligible  in order for the entity to be eligible; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Divided, in such a manner that specific parcels are attributable  to each indirect landholder, then the entity may qualify for eligibility  on those portions of the landholding not attributable to any part owner  who is ineligible.</p>
