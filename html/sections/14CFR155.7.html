Such a term or condition, including one regarding the use of proceeds  from the sale of property, is imposed as a personal covenant or  obligation of the public agency concerned rather than as a term or  condition to the release or as a covenant running with the land, unless  the Administrator determines that the purpose of the term or condition  would be better achieved as a condition or covenant running with the  land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A letter or other document issued by the Administrator that  merely grants consent to or approval of a lease, or to the use of the  property for other than the airport use contemplated by the instrument  of disposal, does not otherwise release the property from the terms,  conditions, reservations, or restrictions of the instrument of disposal.</p>
