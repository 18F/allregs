                            <p class="depth0">If the regional director determines that the case is an appropriate  one for election without formal hearing, an election is conducted as  quickly as possible among the employees and upon the conclusion of the  election the regional director makes available to the parties a tally of  ballots. The parties, however, have an opportunity to make appropriate  challenges and objections to the conduct of the election and they have  the same rights, and the same procedure is followed, with respect to  objections to the conduct of the election and challenged ballots, as is  described in subpart C of 29 CFR part 102 and the statement of the  general course in connection with the postelection procedures in  representation cases under Section 9(c) of the Act, except that no  provision is made for a runoff election. If no such objections are filed  within 7 days and if the challenged ballots are insufficient in number  to affect the results of the election, the regional director issues to  the parties a certification of the results of the election, with the  same force and effect as if issued by the Board.
