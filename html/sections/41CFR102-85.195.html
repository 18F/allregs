The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee for GSA's services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.</p>
