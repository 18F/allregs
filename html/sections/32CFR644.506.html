                            <p class="depth0">As soon as possible after standing timber, embedded sand, gravel, or  stone are made available for disposal, other Federal agencies having  activities within the vicinity of the location of the property and  which, in the opinion to the responsible DE, may desire transfer of the  property will, to the extent practicable or economical, be notified of  the availability of the property for disposal. Such notification should  include the following: information concerning how arrangements can   be made to inspect the property; information concerning conditions  governing cutting, harvesting, mining, or removal of the property and a  statement that the property will be advertised for sale upon the  expiration of fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the  notification, unless a request for transfer of the property, or a  statement that a request for transfer of the property, or a statement  that a request therefor may be made, is received within the fifteen (15)  day period. Should a Federal agency request within the fifteen (15) day  period, that disposal of the property be withheld pending determination  of a requirement, disposal will be withheld not longer than sixty (60)  days from the date of notice of availability, unless DAEN-REM approves  withholding disposal for a longer period. Disposal will not be withheld  for such sixty (60) day period, extended if applicable, if to do so  would interfere with construction or other necessary operations. Should  a request be received from a Federal agency for transfer of the  property, the property will be transferred in accordance with existing  procedures without reimbursement except as provided by FPMR 101-47.203- 7. If no request for transfer is received, the property will be  considered surplus and disposed of by one of the methods outlined in  Sec. Sec. 644.507 and 644.508. The foregoing instructions do not apply  to land clearance operations performed either by contract or force  account. It applies only to those cases where it is proposed to offer  property for sale.</p>
