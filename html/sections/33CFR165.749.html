                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:</p><p class="depth0">COTP means Captain of the Port Savannah, GA.</p><p class="depth0">Designated representatives means Coast Guard Patrol Commanders  including Coast Guard coxswains, petty officers and other officers  operating Coast Guard vessels, and Federal, State, and local officers  designated by or assisting the COTP, in the enforcement of the security  zone.</p><p class="depth0">Escorted vessel means a vessel, other than a large U.S. naval vessel  as defined in 33 CFR 165.2015, that is accompanied by one or more Coast  Guard assets or other Federal, State or local law enforcement agency  assets clearly identifiable by lights, vessel markings, or with agency  insignia as listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coast Guard surface or air asset displaying the Coast Guard  insignia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State and/or local law enforcement asset displaying the  applicable agency markings and/or equipment associated with the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When escorted vessels are moored, dayboards or other visual  indications such as lights or buoys may be used. In all cases, broadcast  notice to mariners will be issued to advise mariners of these  restrictions.</p><p class="depth0">Minimum safe speed means the speed at which a vessel proceeds when  it is fully off plane, completely settled in the water and not creating  excessive wake. Due to the different speeds at which vessels of  different sizes and configurations may travel while in compliance with  this definition, no specific speed is assigned to minimum safe speed. In  no instance should minimum safe speed be interpreted as a speed less  than that required for a particular vessel to maintain steerageway. A  vessel is not proceeding at minimum safe speed if it is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On a plane;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the process of coming up onto or coming off a plane; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Creating an excessive wake.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Regulated area. All navigable waters, as defined in 33 CFR 2.36,  within the Captain of the Port Zone, Savannah, Georgia 33 CFR 3.35-15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Security zone. A 300-yard security zone is established around  each escorted vessel within the regulated area described in paragraph  (b) of this section. This is a moving security zone when the escorted  vessel is in transit and becomes a fixed zone when the escorted vessel  is anchored or moored. A security zone will not extend beyond the  boundary of the regulated area in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Regulations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The general regulations for security zones  contained in Sec. 165.33 of this part apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A vessel may request the permission of the COTP Savannah or a  designated representative to enter the security zone described in  paragraph (c) of this section. If permitted to enter the security zone,  a vessel must proceed at the minimum safe speed and must comply with the  orders of the COTP or a designated representative. No vessel or person  may enter the inner 50-yard portion of the security zone closest to the  vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice of security zone. The COTP will inform the public of the  existence or status of the security zones around escorted vessels in the  regulated area by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Coast Guard assets or  other Federal, State or local law enforcement agency assets will be  clearly identified by lights, vessel markings, or with agency insignia.  When escorted vessels are moored, dayboards or other visual indications  such as lights or buoys may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Contact information. The COTP Savannah may be reached via phone  at (912) 652-4353. Any on scene Coast Guard or designated representative  assets may be reached via VHF-FM channel 16.
