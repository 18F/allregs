                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Upon payment of benefits under this program, the Secretary will be  subrogated to the rights of the requester and may assert a claim against  any third-party payor with a legal or contractual obligation to pay for  (or provide) such benefits and may recover from such third-party  payor(s) the amount of benefits paid up to the amount of benefits the  third-party payor has or had an obligation to pay for (or provide). In  other words, the Secretary may pay benefits before the requester  receives a payment from a third-party payor in specific circumstances.  In those circumstances, the Secretary has a right to be reimbursed by  the third-party payor. The circumstances in which the Secretary may  assert this right include those in which the Secretary pays benefits  under this Program to a requester before a final decision is made that a  third-party payor has an obligation to pay such benefits to the  requester. Requesters receiving benefits under this Program (or their  representatives) shall assist the Secretary in recovering such benefits.  In the event that a requester receives a benefit from a third-party  payor after receiving the same type of benefits from the Secretary under  this Program, the Secretary has a right to recover the amount of the  benefits awarded from the requester.</p>
