Only direction finding radar stations will  be authorized on land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direction finding frequencies. The carrier frequencies  assignable to ship stations for directional finding operations are:</p><p class="depth2">Carrier Frequency  8364 kHz 121.500 MHz 243.00 MHz</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Radiodetermination frequencies for cable-repair ships. Except in  Region 1 the channels in the 285-325 kHz band are assignable to ship  stations for cable-repair radiodetermination operations. In Region 1 the  channels available for assignment for such operations are limited to the  285-315 kHz band. The conditions of use of these channels are set forth  in subpart X of this part. Channel usage must comply with the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are not permitted within the territorial waters of a  foreign country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Their output power must not exceed 15 watts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> They must not cause interference to any maritime station in the  radionavigation service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Radiodetermination frequencies below 500 MHz.

Additionally, the  use of the 2900-3000 MHz band for radiolocation must not cause harmful  interference to the Government meteorological aids service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the 2920-3100 MHz and 9320-9500 MHz bands the use of fixed- frequency transponders for radionavigation is not permitted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Non-Government radiolocation stations may be authorized in the  5460-5470 MHz band on the condition that harmful interference shall not  be caused to the aeronautical or maritime radionavigation services or to  Government radiolocation service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The use of the 5460-5650 MHz band for radionavigation is limited  to shipborne radar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Search and rescue radar transponder stations.
