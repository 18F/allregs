                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The earth station operator whose transmission is suffering  harmful interference shall first check the earth station equipment to  ensure that the equipment is functioning properly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The earth station operator shall then check all other earth  stations in the licensee's network that could be causing the harmful  interference to ensure that none of them is the source of the  interference and to verify that the interference is not from a local  terrestrial source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the earth station operator has determined that the source  of the interference is not another earth station operating in the same  network or from a terrestrial source, the earth station operator shall  contact the satellite system control center and advise the satellite  operator of the problem. The control center operator shall observe the  interference incident and make reasonable efforts to determine the  source of the problem. A record shall be maintained by the control  center operator and the earth station operator of all harmful  interference incidents and their resolution. These records shall be made  available to an FCC representative on request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the suspected source of the interference incident is the  operation of an earth station licensed to operate on one or more of the  satellites in the satellite operator's system, the control center  operator shall advise the offending earth station of the harmful  interference incident and assist in the resolution of the problem where  reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The earth station licensee whose operations are suspected of  causing harmful interference to the operations of another earth station  shall take reasonable measures to determine whether its operations are  the source of the harmful interference problem. Where the operations of  the suspect earth station are the source of the interference, the  licensee of that earth station shall take all measures necessary to  resolve the interference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where the earth station suspected of causing harmful  interference to the operations of another earth station cannot be  identified or is identified as an earth station operating on a satellite  system other than the one on which the earth station suffering harmful  interference is operating, it is the responsibility of a representative  of the earth station suffering harmful interference to contact the  control center of other satellite systems. The operator of the earth  station suffering harmful interference is free to choose any  representative to make this contact, including but not limited to the  operator of the satellite system on which the earth station is  operating. The operator of the earth station suffering harmful  interference is also free to contact the control center of the other  satellite systems directly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> At any point, the system control center operator may contact the  Commission's Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, to assist  in resolving the matter. This office specializes in the resolution of  satellite interference problems. All licensees are required to cooperate  fully with the Commission in any investigation of interference problems.
