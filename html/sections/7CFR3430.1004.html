                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Project types. The Sun Grant Program provides funds for two  distinct project types. Subject to paragraph (b), of the funds provided  by NIFA to the Centers and Subcenter, the required use of funds by each  of the Centers and the Subcenter is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regional competitive research, extension, and education grant  programs. Seventy-five percent must be used for regional competitively  awarded research, extension, and education subgrants to eligible  entities (described in Sec. 3430.1003(b)) to conduct, in a manner  consistent with the purposes described in Sec. 3430.1001, multi- institutional and multistate research, extension, and education programs  on technology development and multi-institutional and multistate  integrated research, extension, and education programs on technology  implementation. Regional competitive grants programs will target  specific elements of the purposes described in Sec. 3430.1001,  implementing national priorities in the context of regional scale  biogeographic and climatic conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requests for applications. The Centers and Subcenter must  develop regional requests for applications (RFAs) utilizing guidance  from regional advisory panels created and administered by the Centers  and Subcenter for purposes of addressing region-specific issues, and  which include representation from academia, the national laboratories,  Federal and State agencies, the private sector, and public interest  groups. Advisory panel members will have appropriate expertise and  experience in the areas of biomass and bioenergy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Peer review of proposals. Each region will announce RFAs and  solicit proposals. These proposals must be peer reviewed by panels in a  manner similar to the system of peer review required by section 103 of  the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998  (7 U.S.C. 7613), and may include representation from Federal and State  laboratories, the national laboratories, and private and public interest  groups, as appropriate. The Centers and Subcenter may use implementing  regulations found in Sec. Sec. 3430.31 through 3430.37 as a guideline  for appropriate peer review standards. Additional guidance may be  provided by NIFA. To ensure consistency across the regions, prior to  announcing the regional RFAs that will be used to solicit proposals, the  Centers and Subcenter must provide NIFA the RFAs for approval by the  designated NIFA program contact, as identified in the NIFA program  solicitation. The Centers and Subcenter shall award subgrants on the  basis of merit, quality, and relevance to advancing the purposes of the  Sun Grant Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Research, extension, and education activities conducted at the  Centers and Subcenter. Except for funds available for administrative  expenses as provided in Sec. 3430.1005(b), the remainder of the funds  must be used for multi-institutional and multistate research, extension,  and education programs on technology development and multi-institutional  and multistate integrated research, extension, and education programs on  technology implementation, in a manner consistent with the purposes  described in Sec. 3430.1001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special provisions for the Western Center and Western Insular  Pacific Subcenter. Funds provided by NIFA to the Western Insular Pacific  Subcenter shall come from an allocation of a portion of the funds  received by the Western Center, as directed by NIFA in the program  solicitation, rather than directly from NIFA. For the Center, the phrase  ``funds provided by NIFA'' in paragraph (a) of this section refers to  those funds provided by NIFA for the Sun Grant Program that are not  allocated to the Subcenter. For the Subcenter, the phrase ``funds  provided by NIFA'' in paragraph (a) of this section refers to those  funds that are allocated to the Subcenter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Priorities. For the regional competitive grants program under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Centers and Subcenter shall use  the plan approved by NIFA under Sec. 3430.1007 in making subawards and  shall give a higher priority to proposals that are consistent with the  plan.</p>
