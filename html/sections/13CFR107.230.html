                            <p class="depth0">Private Capital means the contributed capital of a Licensee, plus unfunded binding commitments by Institutional Investors (including commitments evidenced by a promissory note) to contribute capital to a Licensee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contributed capital. For purposes of this section, contributed capital means the paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of a Corporate Licensee, or the partners' contributed capital of a Partnership Licensee, in either case subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusions from Private Capital. Private Capital does not include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funds borrowed by a Licensee from any source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds obtained through the issuance of Leverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funds obtained directly or indirectly from any Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality, except for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Funds invested by a public pension fund;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Funds obtained from the business revenues (excluding any governmental appropriation) of any federally chartered or government-sponsored corporation established before October 1, 1987, to the extent that such revenues are reflected in the retained earnings of the corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Qualified Non-private Funds'' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any portion of a commitment from an Institutional Investor with a net worth of less than $10 million that exceeds 10 percent of such Institutional Investor's net worth and is not backed by a letter of credit from a State or National bank acceptable to SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-cash capital contributions. Capital contributions in a form other than

cash are subject to the limitations in Sec. 107.240.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Qualified Non-private Funds. Private Capital includes ``Qualified Non-private Funds'' as defined in this paragraph (d); however, investors of Qualified Non-private Funds must not control, directly or indirectly, a Licensee's management, or its board of directors or general partner(s).

This exclusion does not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such Person's net worth is at least twice the amount borrowed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA gives its prior written approval of the capital contribution.
