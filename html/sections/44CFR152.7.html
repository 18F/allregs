                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grantees will have twelve months to incur obligations and  complete the scope of work to fulfill their responsibilities under this  grant program. The performance period of each grant will be detailed in  the Articles of Agreement that we provide each grantee. Grantees may  request funds from FEMA as reimbursement for expenditures made under the  grant program or they may request funds for immediate cash needs under 2  CFR 200.305. Advances of funds may also be approved to meet immediate  cash needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, fire departments cannot use grant funds to pay for  products and services contracted for, or purchased prior to the  effective date of the   grant. However, we will consider requests for reimbursement for these on  an exception basis. Expenses incurred after the application deadline but  prior to award may be eligible for reimbursement if the expenses were  justified, unavoidable (i.e., urgent and compelling), consistent with  the scope of work, and specifically approved by the Assistance Officer.  Expenses, obligations, commitments or contracts incurred or entered into  prior to the application deadline are not eligible to be included as an  expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All grantees must follow their own established procurement  process when buying anything with Federal grant funds as provided in 2  CFR 200.317-200.326. If the grantee does not have an established  procurement process, they must seek a minimum of two bids for any  acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When requesting funding, grantees can only request an amount  that is necessary to satisfy their immediate cash needs directly related  to the grant, i.e., an amount equal to the total eligible grant expenses  due within 30 days. Grantees can request payments of up to one hundred  (100) percent of the federal share of the award amount but only if  delivery of the ordered products and/or services is imminent  (approximately 30 days) and the resulting payment will require the  entire amount of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A grantee may request sufficient funding for a down payment if  required to do so by the seller, such as in grants involving some  purchases of firefighting vehicles. The grantee may request as much as  fifty (50) percent of the federal share of the award amount at the time  of the order placement to pay the down payment. The grantee may request  the balance of the federal share upon delivery of the ordered equipment  or vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The recipients of funding under this program must report to us  on how the grant funding was used and the benefits that resulted. This  will be accomplished via submission of performance reports. Details  regarding the reporting requirements will be provided in the Articles of  Agreement provided to each grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fire departments that receive funding under this program must  agree to provide information to the National Fire Incident Reporting  System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the assistance. If a grantee  does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does  not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee  must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month  period commencing as soon as possible after they develop the capacity to  report. Capacity to report to the NFIRS must be established prior to the  termination of the one-year performance period.
