Such  importations may be made without the submission of a notice of arrival  inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential  information normally supplied by the importer at the time of  importation. Inspection of such importations may be made under the  general authority of Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an importation  is found infected, infested, or contaminated with any plant pest and is  not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be made in  accordance with Sec. 330.106 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart_Citrus Canker and Other Citrus Diseases</p>
