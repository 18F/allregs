To share in any larger royalty suspension volume,  you must file an application described in 30 CFR part 203 (Sec. Sec.   203.71 and 203.83). In no case will royalty-free production for your RS  lease be less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.</p><p class="depth2">Bidding System Selection Criteria</p>
