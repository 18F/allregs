                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allocation to States. Funds shall be allocated annually among  the States on the basis of relative population of persons under age  eighteen. If the amount allocated for Title II (other than parts D and  E) of the JJDP Act is less than $75 million, the amount allocated to  each State will not be less than $325,000, nor more than $400,000,  provided that no State receives less than its allocation for FY 1992.  The territories will receive not less than $75,000 or more than  $100,000. If the amount appropriated for Title II (other than parts D  and E) is $75 million or more, the amount allocated for each State will  be not less than $400,000, nor more than $600,000, provided that parts D  and E have been funded in the full amounts authorized. For the  Territories, the amount is fixed at $100,000. For each of FY's 1994 and  1995, the minimum allocation is established at $600,000 for States and  $100,000 for Territories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of this  section must be met in order to establish the eligibility of Indian  tribes to receive pass through funds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The tribal entity must be recognized by the Secretary of the  Interior as an Indian tribe that performs law enforcement functions as  defined in paragraph (b) (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The tribal entity must agree to attempt to comply with the  requirements of section 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The tribal entity must identify the juvenile justice needs to  be served by these funds within the geographical area where the tribe  performs law enforcement functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Law enforcement functions are deemed to include those activities  pertaining to the custody of children, including, but not limited to,  police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime and delinquency or  to apprehend criminal and delinquent offenders, and/or activities of  adult and juvenile corrections, probation, or parole authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To carry out this requirement, OJJDP will annually provide each  state with the most recent Bureau of Census statistics on the number of  persons under age 18 living within the state, and the number of persons  under age 18 who reside in geographical areas where Indian tribes  perform law enforcement functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pass-through funds available to tribal entities under section  223(a)(5)(C) shall be made available within states to Indian tribes,  combinations of Indian tribes, or to an organization or organizations  designated by such tribe(s), that meet the standards set forth in  paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(iii) of this section. Where the relative number of  persons under age 18 within a geographic area where an Indian tribe  performs law enforcement functions is too small to warrant an individual  subgrant or subgrants, the state may, after consultation with the  eligible tribe(s), make pass-through funds available to a combination of  eligible tribes within the state, or to an organization or organizations  designated by and representing a group of qualifying tribes, or target  the funds on the larger tribal jurisdictions within the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Consistent with section 223(a)(4) of the JJDP Act, the state  must provide for consultation with Indian tribes or a combination of  eligible tribes within the state, or an organization or organizations  designated by qualifying tribes, in the development of a state plan  which adequately takes into account the juvenile justice needs and  requests of those Indian tribes within the state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Match. Formula grants under the JJDP Act shall be 100% of  approved costs, with the exception of planning and administration funds,  which require a 100 percent cash match (dollar for dollar), and  construction projects funded under section 299C(a)(2) which also require  a 100 percent cash match.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds for administration. Not more than ten percent of the total  annual Formula Grant award may be utilized to develop the annual  juvenile justice plan and pay for administrative expenses, including  project monitoring. These funds are to be matched on a dollar for dollar  basis. The State shall make available needed funds for planning and  administration to units of local government on an equitable basis. Each  annual application must identify uses of such funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nonparticipating States. Pursuant to section 223(d), the OJJDP  Administrator shall endeavor to make the fund allotment under section  222(a), of a State which chooses not to participate or loses its  eligibility to participate in the formula grant program, directly  available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the  nonparticipating State. The funds may be used only for the purpose(s) of  achieving deinstitutionalization of status offenders and nonoffenders,  separation of juveniles from incarcerated adults, removal of juveniles  from adult jails and lockups, and reducing the disproportionate  confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. Absent a request for  extension which demonstrates compelling circumstances justifying the  reallocation of formula grant funds back to the State to which the funds  were initially allocated, or the proceedings under section 223(d),  formula grant funds allocated to a State which has failed to submit an  application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for  the funds will, beginning with FY 1995 be reallocated to the  nonparticipating State program on September 30 of the fiscal year for  which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be  competitively awarded to eligible recipients pursuant to program  announcements published in the Federal Register.</p>
