Sec.  52e.5(a) and 52e.5(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to  support the project without requiring the project to recompete for  funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5  years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and  subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A  grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued  for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and  the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of  such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the  availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a  determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of  the government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any  grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any  additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to  any approved application or portion of an approved application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for  the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the  approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the  terms, and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles  prescribed in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.
