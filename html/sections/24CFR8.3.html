                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth0">Accessible, when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of

the facility when designed, constructed or altered, can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. The phrase accessible to and usable by is synonomous with accessible.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible, when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means that the unit is located on an accessible route and when designed, constructed, altered or adapted can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in Sec. 8.32 is accessible within the meaning of this paragraph. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with handicaps (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same recipient, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible route means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces in a building or facility that complies with the space and reach requirements of applicable standards prescribed by Sec. 8.32. An accessible route that serves only accessible units occupied by persons with hearing or vision impairments need not comply with those requirements intended to effect accessibility for persons with mobility impairments.</p><p class="depth0">Adaptability means the ability of certain elements of a dwelling unit, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added to, raised, lowered, or otherwise altered, to accommodate the needs of persons with or without handicaps, or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability. For example, in a unit adaptable for a hearing-impaired person, the wiring for visible emergency alarms may be installed but the alarms need not be installed until such time as the unit is made ready for occupancy by a hearing-impaired person.</p><p class="depth0">Alteration means any change in a facility or its permanent fixtures or equipment. It includes, but is not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, changes or rearrangements in structural parts and extraordinary repairs. It does not include normal maintenance or repairs, reroofing, interior decoration, or changes to mechanical systems.</p><p class="depth0">Applicant for assistance means one who submits an application, request, plan, or statement required to be approved by a Department official or by a primary recipient as a condition of eligibility for Federal financial assistance. An application means such a request, plan or statement.</p><p class="depth0">Auxiliary aids means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. For example, auxiliary aids for persons with impaired vision may include readers, Brailled materials, audio recordings, and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids for persons with impaired hearing may include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's), interpreters, notetakers, written materials, and other similar services and devices.</p><p class="depth0">Department or HUD means the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p class="depth0">Facility means all or any portion of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, rolling stock or other real or personal property or interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">Federal financial assistance means any assistance provided or otherwise made available by the Department through any grant, loan, contract or any other arrangement, in the form of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Funds;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services of Federal personnel; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Real or personal property or any interest in or use of such property, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfers or leases of the property for less than fair market value or for reduced consideration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proceeds from a subsequent transfer or lease of the property if the Federal share of its fair market value is not returned to the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0">Federal financial assistance includes community development funds in the form of proceeds from loans guaranteed under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, but does not include assistance made available through direct Federal procurement contracts or payments made under these contracts or any other contract of insurance or guaranty.</p><p class="depth0">Handicap means any condition or characteristic that renders a person an individual with handicaps.</p><p class="depth0">Historic preservation programs or activities means programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Historic properties means those properties that are listed or are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or such properties designated as historic under a statute of the appropriate State or local government body.</p><p class="depth0">Individual with handicaps means any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment. For purposes of employment, this term does not include: Any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents the individual from performing the duties of the job in question, or whose employment, by reason of current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others; or any individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unable to perform the duties of the job. For purposes of other programs and activities, the term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents the individual from participating in the program or activity in question, or whose participation, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.
