                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must submit each report in Table 8 to this subpart that  applies to you. If you are required to (or elect to) continuously  monitor Hg and/or HCl and/or HF emissions, you must also submit the  electronic reports required under appendix A and/or appendix B to the  subpart, at the specified frequency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first compliance report must cover the period beginning on  the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in  Sec. 63.9984 and ending on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the  first date that occurs at least 180 days after the compliance date that  is specified for your source in Sec. 63.9984.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first compliance report must be postmarked or submitted  electronically no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is  the first date following the end of the first calendar half after the  compliance date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.9984.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each subsequent compliance report must cover the semiannual  reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual  reporting period from July 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each subsequent compliance report must be postmarked or  submitted electronically no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever  date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting  regulations pursuant to part 70 or part 71 of this chapter, and if the  permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual  reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR  71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance  reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established  instead of according to the dates in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information required by the summary report located in  63.10(e)(3)(vi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total fuel use by each affected source subject to an  emission limit, for each calendar month within the semiannual reporting  period, including, but not limited to, a description of the fuel,  whether the fuel has received a non-waste determination by EPA or your  basis for concluding that the fuel is not a waste, and the total fuel  usage amount with units of measure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indicate whether you burned new types of fuel during the  reporting period. If you did burn new types of fuel you must include the  date of the performance test where that fuel was in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include the date of the most recent tune-up for each unit  subject to the requirement to conduct a performance tune-up according to  Sec. 63.10021(e). Include the date of the most recent burner inspection  if it was not done every 36 (or 48) months and was delayed until the  next scheduled unit shutdown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each instance of startup or shutdown:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include the maximum clean fuel storage capacity and the maximum  hourly heat input that can be provided for each clean fuel determined  according to the requirements of Sec. 63.10032(f).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include the information required to be monitored, collected, or  recorded according to the requirements of Sec. 63.10020(e).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you choose to use CEMS for compliance purposes, include  hourly average CEMS values and hourly average flow rates.

The RATA data shall be submitted in the file format generated  through use of EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (http:// www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only RATA data compounds listed  on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement. Owners or operators  who claim that some of the information being submitted for RATAs is  confidential business information (CBI) shall submit a complete ERT file  including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk or other  commonly used electronic storage media (including, but not limited to,  flash drives) by registered letter to EPA and the same ERT file with the  CBI omitted to EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. The  compact disk or other commonly used electronic storage media shall be  clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S.   EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02,  4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. At the discretion of the delegated  authority, owners or operators shall also submit these RATAs to the  delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority.  Owners or operators shall submit calibration error testing, drift  checks, and other information required in the performance evaluation as  described in Sec. 63.2 and as required in this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or after April 16, 2017, for a PM CEMS, PM CPMS, or approved  alternative monitoring using a HAP metals CEMS, within 60 days after the  reporting periods ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and  December 31st, you must submit quarterly reports to EPA's WebFIRE  database by using the CEDRI that is accessed through EPA's CDX  (www.epa.gov/cdx). You must use the appropriate electronic reporting  form in CEDRI or provide an alternate electronic file consistent with  EPA's reporting form output format. For each reporting period, the  quarterly reports must include all of the calculated 30-boiler operating  day rolling average values derived from the CEMS and PM CPMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reports for an SO2 CEMS, a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap  monitoring system, an HCl or HF CEMS, and any supporting monitors for  such systems (such as a diluent or moisture monitor) shall be submitted  using the ECMPS Client Tool, as provided for in Appendices A and B to  this subpart and Sec. 63.10021(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On or after April 16, 2017, submit the compliance reports  required under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and the  notification of compliance status required under Sec. 63.10030(e) to  EPA's WebFIRE database by using the CEDRI that is accessed through EPA's  CDX (www.epa.gov/cdx). You must use the appropriate electronic reporting  form in CEDRI or provide an alternate electronic file consistent with  EPA's reporting form output format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All reports required by this subpart not subject to the  requirements in paragraphs (f) introductory text and (f)(1) through (4)  of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate  address listed in Sec. 63.13. If acceptable to both the Administrator  and the owner or operator of an EGU, these reports may be submitted on  electronic media. The Administrator retains the right to require  submittal of reports subject to paragraphs (f) introductory text and  (f)(1) through (4) of this section in paper format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prior to April 16, 2017, all reports subject to electronic  submittal in paragraphs (f) introductory text, (f)(1), (2), and (4)  shall be submitted to the EPA at the frequency specified in those  paragraphs in electronic portable document format (PDF) using the ECMPS  Client Tool. Each PDF version of a submitted report must include  sufficient information to assess compliance and to demonstrate that the  testing was done properly. The following data elements must be entered  into the ECMPS Client Tool at the time of submission of each PDF file:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facility name, physical address, mailing address (if  different from the physical address), and county;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ORIS code (or equivalent ID number assigned by EPA's Clean  Air Markets Division (CAMD)) and the Facility Registry System (FRS) ID;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The EGU (or EGUs) to which the report applies.
