                            <p class="depth0">The State's request for waiver must include a specific explanation,  justification or documentation of why the claim is or will be late. This  request must establish that the lateness in filing the claim is for good  cause as defined in Sec. 95.22 and not due to neglect or administrative  inadequacy. If the claim has not been filed, the State must also tell us  when the claim will be filed.</p>
