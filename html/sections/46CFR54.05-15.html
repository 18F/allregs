For these tests, the test plates shall be oriented with their final rolling direction parallel to the weld axis (i.e., so that transverse impact specimens result), and with the V-notch normal to the plate surface. The sample weld joint preparation shall be the same as that used in production. The number of test specimens and the location of their notches shall be as shown in Figure 54.05-15(a) and as described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Three specimens with the notch centered in the weld metal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three specimens with the notch centered on the fusion line between parent plate and weld. (The fusion line may be identified by etching the specimen with a mild reagent.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Three specimens with the notch centered in the heat affected zone, 1 mm from the fusion line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Same as paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but 3 mm from the fusion line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Same as paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but 5 mm from the fusion line.
