                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The system shall be so arranged and installed that the presence  of smoke in any of the protected spaces will automatically be indicated  visually to an observer directly in front of the detecting cabinet. The  visible notice shall automatically indicate the zone in which the smoke  originated. The detecting cabinet shall normally be located in the  pilothouse or fire control station. On vessels over 5,000 gross tons,  there shall also be an automatic audible alarm in the wheelhouse  together with an auxiliary audible alarm in the engine room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the detecting cabinet is not located in the pilothouse or  fire control station, it shall be located in convenient proximity to the  valve control station of the extinguishing system. In this case, there  shall be in the pilothouse or fire control station automatic visual  alarms, one for each zone in which an alarm may originate, as well as an  automatic audible alarm. There shall also be an auxiliary audible alarm  in the engine room. For installations contracted for on or after January  1, 1962, where detecting cabinets are not located in the pilothouse or  an adjacent fire control station having direct access to the pilothouse,  an efficient means of direct communication shall be provided between the  pilothouse and the stations where the detecting cabinets are located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A sufficient quantity of exhaust from the detecting cabinet  shall be discharged in the vicinity of the cabinet to permit the  detection of fire by odor. A valve shall be installed in such space to  direct the exhaust, if obnoxious, to the outside.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The smoke detecting system shall be used for no other purpose  except that it may be incorporated with the fire extinguishing system to  the spaces covered by the smoke detecting system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The accumulators, detecting cabinet, interconnecting valves with  the fire extinguishing system, alarms, and indicating devices shall be  of an approved type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All wiring and electrical circuits and equipment shall meet the  applicable requirements of subchapter J (Electrical Engineering) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A framed chart or diagram shall be installed adjacent to the  detecting cabinet and auxiliary panel indicating the location of the  various zones and giving instructions for the operation,   maintenance, and testing of the system. The chart at the cabinet  location or a separate card or booklet to be kept near the chart, shall  have tabulated spaces for the date and signature of the licensed officer  of the vessel who shall witness or conduct the periodic tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The audible smoke detecting alarms shall be identified as  required by Sec.  78.47-13 of this subchapter.</p>
