A vibratory cervical dilator is a device designed to dilate the cervical os by stretching it with a power-driven vibrating probe head. The device is used to gain access to the uterus or to induce abortion, but is not to be used during labor when a viable fetus is desired or anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required. A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 1996 for any vibratory cervical dilator that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before December 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a vibratory cervical dilator that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.

Any other vibratory cervical dilator shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
