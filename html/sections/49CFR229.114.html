                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Periodic steam generator inspection. Except as provided in Sec. 229.33, each steam generator shall be inspected and tested in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section at intervals not to exceed 92 days, unless the steam generator is isolated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. All non-complying conditions shall be repaired or the steam generator shall be isolated as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section before the locomotive is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Isolation of a steam generator. A steam generator will be considered isolated if the water suction pipe to the water pump and the leads to the main switch (steam generator switch) are disconnected, and the train line shut-off-valve is wired closed or a blind gasket is applied. Before an isolated steam generator is returned to use, it shall be inspected and tested pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forms. Each periodic steam generator inspection and test shall be recorded on Form FRA F 6180-49A required by paragraph Sec. 229.23. When Form FRA F 6180-49A for the locomotive is replaced, data for the steam generator inspections shall be transferred to the new Form FRA F6180-49A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tests and requirements. Each periodic steam generator inspection and test shall include the following tests and requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All electrical devices and visible insulation shall be inspected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All automatic controls, alarms, and protective devices shall be inspected and tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Steam pressure gauges shall be tested by comparison with a dead-weight tester or a test gauge designed for this purpose. The siphons to the steam gauges shall be removed and their connections examined to determine that they are open.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Safety valves shall be set and tested under steam after the steam pressure gauge is tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual steam generator tests. Each steam generator that is not isolated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure at least 25 percent above the working pressure and the visual return water-flow indicator shall be removed and inspected. The testing under this paragraph shall be performed at intervals that do not exceed 368 calendar days.
