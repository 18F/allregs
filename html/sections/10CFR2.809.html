                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In its advisory capacity to the Commission, the ACRS may  recommend that the Commission initiate rulemaking in a particular area.  The Commission will respond to such rulemaking recommendation in writing  within 90 days, noting its intent to implement, study, or defer action  on the recommendation. In the event the Commission decides not to accept  or decides to defer action on the recommendation, it will give its  reasons for doing so. Both the ACRS recommendation and the Commission's  response will be made available at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov,  following transmittal of the Commission's response to the ACRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a rule involving nuclear safety matters within the purview  of the ACRS is under development by the NRC Staff, the Staff will ensure  that the ACRS is given an opportunity to provide advice at appropriate  stages and to identify issues to be considered during rulemaking  hearings.
