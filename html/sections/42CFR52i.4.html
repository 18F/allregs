                            <p class="depth0">A number of universities and other organizations have established  closely affiliated, but separately incorporated,   organizations to facilitate the administration of research and other  programs supported by federal funds. Such legally independent entities  are often referred to as ``foundations,'' although this term does not  necessarily appear in the name of the organization. An institution  awarded an endowment grant under section 464z-3(h) of the Act or using  designated grant funds for endowment purposes under section 464z-4(f) of  the Act may designate a foundation associated with the institution to  receive the endowment funds only for investment purposes if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The institution assures in its application that the foundation  is legally authorized to receive the endowment funds and to administer  the endowment funds in accordance with the regulations set forth in this  part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The foundation agrees to administer the endowment funds in  accordance with the regulations in this part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The institution agrees to be liable for any violation by the  foundation of any applicable regulation, including any violation  resulting in monetary liability; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee institution has control and is responsible for the  administration of the grant accounts.</p>
