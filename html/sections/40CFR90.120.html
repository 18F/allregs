The Administrator may reject data generated under test procedures which do not correlate with data generated under the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer may elect to use the test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065 as an alternate test procedure without getting advance approval by the Administrator or meeting the other conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The manufacturer must identify in its application for certification that the engines were tested using the procedures in 40 CFR part 1065. For any EPA testing with Phase 1 or Phase 2 engines, EPA will use the manufacturer's selected procedures for mapping engines, generating duty cycles, and applying cycle-validation criteria. For any other parameters, EPA may conduct testing using either of the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where we specify mandatory compliance with the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, manufacturers may elect to use the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, as an alternate test procedure without advance approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional procedures approved during Phase 1 can be carried over to Phase 2, following advance approval by the Administrator, to the extent the alternate procedure continues to yield results equal to the results from the specified test procedures in subpart E of this part.
