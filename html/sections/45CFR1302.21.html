                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a grantee shows legal status but impaired financial viability  the responsible HHS official will entertain a timely request for  amendment of the grantee's approved application which restores the  grantee's financial viability either by a reduction in the program which  produces minimum disruption to services and functions, or by an  amendment which incorporates essential functions and services not  previously funded as part of the total cost of the Head Start program,  and, therefore, requires an increase in the amount of the Head Start  grant but which will not result in a Federal share of the total cost of  the Head Start program in excess of the percentage authorized by the Act  or applicable regulations. In considering such a request which includes  an increase in the Head Start grant the responsible HHS official will  take into account the funds available to him for obligation and whether  the proposed increase is consistent with that distribution of Head Start  funds which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximizes the number of childen served within his area of  responsibility, or in the case of experimental or demonstration  programs, the experimental or demonstration benefits to be achieved, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintains approximately the same distribution of Head Start  program funds to States as exist during the fiscal year in which his  decision is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this part, or submitted as a part of a timely  application for refunding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The grantee will be notified in writing by the responsible HHS  official within 30 days after submission of the requested amendment of  the decision to approve or disapprove the requested amendment. If the  requested amendment is disapproved the notice will contain a statement  of the reasons for disapproval.</p>
