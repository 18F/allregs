                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For a commodity or service to be suitable for addition to the  Procurement List, each of the following criteria must be satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employment potential. The proposed addition must demonstrate a  potential to generate employment for persons who are blind or have other  severe disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonprofit agency qualifications. The nonprofit agency (or  agencies) proposing to furnish the item must qualify as a nonprofit  agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities,  as set forth in part 51-4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Capability. The nonprofit agency (or agencies) desiring to  furnish a commodity or service under the JWOD Program must satisfy the  Committee as to the extent of the labor operations to be performed and  that it will have the capability to meet Government quality standards  and delivery schedules by the time it assumes responsibility for  supplying the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Level of impact on the current contractor for the commodity or  service. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the  Procurement List is likely to have a severe adverse impact on the  current contractor for the specific commodity or service, the Committee  gives particular attention to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The possible impact on the contractor's total sales, including  the sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations. In addition,  the Committee considers the effects of previous Committee actions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whether that contractor has been a continuous supplier to the  Government of the specific commodity or service proposed for addition  and is, therefore, more dependent on the income from such sales to the  Government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is not a current contract for the commodity or service  being proposed for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee may  consider the most recent contractor to furnish the item to the  Government as the current contractor for the purpose of determining the  level of impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the suitability of a commodity or service for  addition to the Procurement List, the Committee also considers other  information it deems pertinent, including comments on a proposal  published in the Federal Register to add the commodity or service to the  Procurement List and information submitted by Government personnel and  interested persons. Because the Committee's authority to establish fair  market prices is separate from its authority to determine the  suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement  List, the Committee does not consider comments on proposed fair market  prices for commodities and services proposed for addition to the  Procurement List to be pertinent to a suitability determination.
