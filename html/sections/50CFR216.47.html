                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank samples  (NMMTB). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A principal investigator, contributor or holder of a  scientific research permit issued in accordance with the provisions of  this subpart may apply for access to a tissue specimen sample in the  NMMTB. Applicants for tissue specimen samples from the NMMTB must submit  a signed written request with attached study plan to the Marine Mammal  Health and Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP) Program Manager, Office  of Protected Resources, NMFS. The written request must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A clear and concise statement of the proposed use of the banked  tissue specimen. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed use of  the   banked tissue is consistent with the goals of the NMMTB and the MMHSRP.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The goals of the MMHSRP are to facilitate the collection and  dissemination of reference data on marine mammals and health trends of  marine mammal populations in the wild; to correlate the health of marine  mammals and marine mammal populations in the wild with available data on  physical, chemical, and biological environmental parameters; and to  coordinate effective responses to unusual mortality events.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The goal of the NMMTB is to maintain quality controlled marine  mammal tissues that will permit retrospective analyses to determine  environmental trends of contaminants and other analytes of interest and  that will provide the highest quality samples for analyses using new and  innovative techniques.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the applicant's scientific research permit. The  applicant must demonstrate that the proposed use of the banked tissue is  authorized by the permit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name of principal investigator, official title, and affiliated  research or academic organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specific tissue sample and quantity desired;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Research facility where analyses will be conducted. The  applicant must demonstrate that the research facility will follow the  Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) program, which was designed to ensure  the accuracy, precision, level of detection, and intercompatibility of  data resulting from chemical analyses of marine mammal tissues. The AQA  consists of annual interlaboratory comparisons and the development of  control materials and standard reference materials for marine mammal  tissues;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Verification that funding is available to conduct the research;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Estimated date for completion of research, and schedule/date  of subsequent reports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Agreement that all research findings based on use of the  banked tissue will be reported to the NMMTB, MMHSRP Program Manager and  the contributor; and the sequences of tissue specimen samples that are  used/released for genetic analyses (DNA sequencing) will be archived in  the National Center for biotechnology Information's GenBank. Sequence  accessions in GenBank should document the source, citing a NIST field  number that indentifies the animal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Agreement that credit and acknowledgment will be given to U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), US Geologic Service (USGS), National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Minerals Management  Service (MMS), NMFS, the NMMTB, and the collector for use of banked  tissues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant shall insert the following acknowledgment in all  publications, abstracts, or presentations based on research using the  banked tissue:</p><p class="depth3">The specimens used in this study were collected by [the contributor]  and provided by the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank, which is  maintained in the National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank at NIST and which  is operated under the direction of NMFS with the collaboration of MMS,  USGS, USFWS, and NIST through the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding  Response Program [and the Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Project  if the samples are from Alaska].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon submission of a complete application, the MMHSRP Program  Manager will send the request and attached study plan to the following  entities which will function as the review committee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Appropriate Federal agency (NMFS or USFWS) marine mammal  management office for that particular species; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Representatives of the NMMTB Collaborating Agencies (NMFS,  USFS, USGS Biological Resources Division, and NIST) If no member of the  review committee is an expert in the field that is related to the  proposed research activity, any member may request an outside review of  the proposal, which may be outside of NMFS or USFWS but within the  Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The MMHSRP Program Manager will send the request and attached  study plan to any contributor(s) of the tissue specimen sample. The  contributor(s) of the sample may submit comments on the proposed  research activity to the Director, Office of Protected Resources within  30 days of the date   that the request was sent to the contributor(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The USFWS Representative of the NMMTB Collaborating Agencies  will be chair of review committees for requests involving species  managed by the DOI. The MMHSRP Program Manager will be chair of all  other review committees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each committee chair will provide recommendations on the request  and an evaluation of the study plan to the Director, Office of Protected  Resources, NMFS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, will make the  final decision on release of the samples based on the advice provided by  the review committee, comments received from any contributor(s) of the  sample within the time provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and  determination that the proposed use of the banked tissue specimen is  consistent with the goals of the MMHSRP and the NMMTB. The Director will  send a written decision to the applicant and send copies to all review  committee members. If the samples are released, the response will  indicate whether the samples have been homogenized and, if not, the  homogenization schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The applicant will bear all shipping and homogenization costs  related to use of any specimens from the NMMTB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The applicant will dispose of the tissue specimen sample  consistent with the provisions of the applicant's scientific research  permit after the research is completed, unless the requester submits  another request and receives approval pursuant to this section. The  request must be submitted within three months after the original project  has been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [69 FR 41979, July 13, 2004]    Sec.
