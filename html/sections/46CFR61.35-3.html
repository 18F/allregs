                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tests and checks must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety (Programming) controls. Safety controls must control and  cycle the unit in the proper manner and sequence. Proper prepurge,  ignition, postpurge, and modulation must be   verified. All time intervals must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flame safeguard. The flame safeguard system must be tested by  causing flame and ignition failures. Operation of the audible alarm and  visible indicator must be verified. The shutdown times must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel supply controls. Satisfactory shutdown operation of the two  fuel control solenoid valves must be verified. No visible leakage from  the valves into the burner(s) must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fuel oil pressure limit control. A safety shutdown must be  initiated by lowering the fuel oil pressure below the value required for  safe combustion. System shutdown and the need for manual reset prior to  automatic startup must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fuel oil temperature limit control. (Units designed to burn  heavy fuel oil.) A safety shutdown must be initiated by lowering the  fuel oil temperature below the designed temperature. System shutdown and  the need for manual reset prior to automatic startup must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Combustion controls. Smooth and stable operation of the  combustion controls must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Draft limit control. The draft loss interlock switch must be  tested to ensure proper operation. The draft limit control must cause  burner shutdown and prevent startup when an inadequate air volume is  supplied to the burner(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Limit controls. Shutdown caused by the limit controls must be  verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Water level controls. Water level controls must be tested by  slowly lowering the water level in the boiler. Each operating water  level control must be individually tested. The upper low water cutoff  and the lower low water cutoff must each be tested. The audible alarm  and visible indicator associated with the lower low water cutoff must be  tested. The manual reset device must be tested after the lower low water  cutoff has been activated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Feed water flow controls. The feed water flow limit device  (found on steam boilers and water heaters without water level controls)  must be tested by interrupting the feed water supply. Manual reset must  be required prior to restarting the boiler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Low voltage test. The fuel supply to the burners must  automatically shut off when the supply voltage is lowered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Switches. All switches must be tested to verify satisfactory  operation.</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 61.40_Design Verification and Periodic Testing of Vital System</p><p class="depth3">Automation</p><p class="depth3">Source: CGD 81-030, 53 FR 17837, May 18, 1988, unless otherwise  noted.</p>
