A recreational boat is a vessel which by design and  construction is intended by the manufacturer to be operated primarily  for pleasure, or to be leased, rented or chartered to another for the  latter's pleasure (rather than for commercial or military purposes); and  whose major structural components are fabricated and assembled in an  indoor, production-line manufacturing plant or similar land-side  operation and not in a dry dock, graving dock, or marine railway   on the navigable waters of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum recreational boat surface coating operation means the  application of primers or top coats to aluminum recreational boats. It  also includes the application of clear coats over top coats. Aluminum  recreational boat surface coating operations do not include the  application of wood coatings or antifoulant coatings to aluminum  recreational boats.</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum coating spray gun cleaning means the process of flushing or  removing paints or coatings from the interior or exterior of a spray gun  used to apply aluminum primers, clear coats, or top coats to aluminum  recreational boats.</p><p class="depth0">Aluminum wipedown solvents means solvents used to remove oil,  grease, welding smoke, or other contaminants from the aluminum surfaces  of a boat before priming or painting. Aluminum wipedown solvents contain  no coating solids; aluminum surface preparation materials that contain  coating solids are considered coatings for the purpose of this subpart  and are not wipedown solvents.</p><p class="depth0">Antifoulant coating means any coating that is applied to the  underwater portion of a boat specifically to prevent or reduce the  attachment of biological organisms and that is registered with EPA as a  pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act  (7 U.S.C. section 136, et seq.).

The pressure may be clamping pressure, fluid pressure, atmospheric  pressure, or vacuum pressure used either alone or in combination. The  mold surfaces may be rigid or flexible. Closed molding includes, but is  not limited to, compression molding with sheet molding compound,  infusion molding, resin injection molding (RIM), vacuum-assisted resin  transfer molding (VARTM), resin transfer molding (RTM), and vacuum- assisted compression molding. Processes in which a closed mold is used  only to compact saturated fabric or remove air or excess resin from the  fabric (such as in vacuum bagging), are not considered closed molding.

If no HAP is added to a material as a thinner  or diluent, then the HAP content is the same as the HAP content of the  material as purchased from the supplier. For resin and gel coat, HAP  content does not include any HAP contained in the catalyst added to the  resin or gel coat during application to initiate curing.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous air pollutant data sheet (HDS) means documentation  furnished by a material supplier or an outside laboratory to provide the  organic HAP content of the material by weight, measured using an EPA  Method, manufacturer's formulation data, or an equivalent method. For  aluminum coatings, the HDS also documents the solids content by volume,  determined from the manufacturer's formulation data. The purpose of the  HDS is to help the affected source in showing compliance with the  organic HAP content limits contained in this subpart. The HDS must state  the maximum total organic HAP concentration, by weight, of the material.  It must include any organic HAP concentrations equal to or greater than  0.1 percent by weight for individual organic HAP that are carcinogens,  as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard  Communication Standard (29 CFR part 1910), and 1.0 percent by weight for  all other individual organic HAP, as formulated. The HDS must also  include test conditions if EPA Method 311 is used for determining  organic HAP content.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) model point value means  a number calculated for open molding operations that is a surrogate for  emissions and is used to determine if your open molding operations are  in compliance with the provisions of this subpart. The units for MACT  model point values are kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of resin or  gel coat applied.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer's certification means documentation furnished by a  material supplier that shows the organic HAP content of a material and  includes a HDS.</p><p class="depth0">Mold means the cavity or surface into or on which gel coat, resin,  and fibers are placed and from which finished fiberglass parts take  their form.</p><p class="depth0">Mold sealing and release agents means materials applied to a mold to  seal, polish, and lubricate the mold to prevent parts from sticking to  the mold. Mold sealers, waxes, and glazing and buffing compounds are  considered mold sealing and release agents for the purposes of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Mold stripping and cleaning solvents means materials used to remove  mold sealing and release agents from a mold before the mold surface is  repaired, polished, or lubricated during normal mold maintenance.</p><p class="depth0">Month means a calendar month.</p><p class="depth0">Neat resin means a resin to which no filler has been added.</p><p class="depth0">Nonatomized resin application means any application technology in  which the resin is not broken into droplets or an aerosol as it travels  from the application equipment to the surface of the part.
