                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Depositing property damage recovery--(1) Machines, supplies, watercraft, aircraft, vehicles other than General Services Administration-owned. Recovered money must be deposited into the General Treasury Account 21R3019. This account remains the same every fiscal year. It was established in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3302(b) and by Comptroller General decision B-205508, 64 Comp. Gen. 431.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Real property. Collection for damage to real property must be deposited into an escrow account on behalf of the installation or activity at which the loss occurred. This escrow account must be set up at the request of the command claims service, ACO or CPO with the local finance office or resource management office with responsibility for department of engineering and housing or department of public works funds. The escrow account must be set up and managed by the department of engineering and housing or the department of public works to (1) temporarily hold deposits, and (2) to ``roll over'' deposits each fiscal year in order to avoid reversion of these deposits to the General Treasury at the end of each fiscal year. If the escrow account is not set up and managed in this manner it is operating in violation of 10 U.S.C. 2782.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NAFI property. The Risk Management Program (RIMP) often reimburses local NAFIs for property loss or damage to facilitate return of equipment to daily use. When money is recovered from tortfeasors and their insurance carriers contact the NAFI involved for instructions on the current procedures as to where the recovered money is to be forwarded and deposited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Army Stock Fund or Defense Business Operations Fund property. Monies recovered for damage to property belonging to one of these funds will be returned to that fund unless the fund has charged the cost of repair or replacement to an appropriated fund account. The Defense Business Operations Fund replaced the Army Industrial Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Government housing in cases of abuse or neglect by soldiers or families. Monies recovered for damage to government housing caused by a soldier's abuse or negligence (or by a soldier's family member or guest of the soldier) will be deposited into that installation's family housing operations and maintenance (O&M;) account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Government housing in cases of negligence by nonresidents. Government housing caused by the negligence of a nonresident must be asserted against the nonresident directly or through his/her insurer. Settlement checks must be deposited into the real property escrow account in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2782.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Depositing recovery of pay provided to a soldier while incapacitated. Monies recovered for the costs of pay provided to a soldier injured by the tortious acts of another shall be credited to the local O&M; account that supports the command, activity, or other unit to which the soldier was assigned at the time of the injury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Depositing medical care recovery--(1) To a medical treatment facility account. Continental U.S. (CONUS) and outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) claims offices, and command claims services, will deposit money recovered from an automobile insurer for medical care provided, paid for by, in or through an MTF to the O&M; account of the Army, Navy, or Air Force MTF that provided the care. CONUS and OCONUS claims offices, and command

claims services, will deposit money recovered from any payor, under any provision of law, for medical care provided or paid for by, in or through an MTF into the MTF's O&M; account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deposits when TRICARE paid directly for treatment. The account in which to deposit affirmative claims recoveries when TRICARE has paid directly for the medical treatment is a Defense Health Program (DHP) account for reallocation to the services. This replaces the general treasury miscellaneous receipts account published in AR 37-100 (obsolete). Deposit to TRICARE using this new account for recoveries pending deposit, and recoveries for any claim settled on or after October 1, 2002. Retroactive claims depositing is not necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Apportionment of medical care recovery between accounts. Claims offices will often have to apportion recovered money among different accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Apportioning money between accounts. If care was provided by an MTF and paid for by or through the MTF and/or directly by TRICARE and/or a unit account for military lost wages if any, and the amount recovered is less than the amount asserted, deposit a prorated amount of money into each TRICARE account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Apportioning money between two or more medical treatment facility accounts. If care was provided by two or more MTFs and the claims office recovers less than the amount asserted, the claims office should give each MTF a pro rata share of the money recovered. For example, if MTF one provided $2,000 worth of care and MTF two provided $1,000 worth of care, the claims office will deposit $800 of a $1,200 recovery to MTF one's account and the remaining $400 to MTF two's account. Similarly, if the claims office recovers an amount less than that asserted for medical care expenses and costs of pay provided, the claims office should give a pro rata share of the money recovered to both the MTF and the appropriation account that supports the injured soldier's unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fiscal integrity. Field claims offices must reconcile the property damage and medical care recovery accounts with their servicing defense accounting office. Field claims offices must ensure that their deposits have been credited to the proper accounts and that these accounts have not been improperly charged. All accounts must be reconciled at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
