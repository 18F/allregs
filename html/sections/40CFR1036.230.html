                            <p class="depth0">See 40 CFR 86.001-24 for instructions on how to divide your product  line into families of engines that are expected to have similar emission  characteristics throughout the useful life. You must certify your  engines to the standards of Sec.  1036.108 using the same engine  families you use for criteria pollutants under 40 CFR part 86. The  following provisions also apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engines certified as hybrid engines or power packs may not be  included in an engine family with engines with conventional powertrains.  Note that this does not prevent you from including engines in a  conventional family if they are used in hybrid vehicles, as long as you  certify them conventionally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you certify engines in the family for use as both vocational  and tractor engines, you must split your family into two separate  subfamilies. Indicate in the application for certification that the  engine family is to be split.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate emission credits relative to the vocational engine  standard for the number of engines sold into vocational applications and  relative to the tractor engine standard for the number of engines sold  into non-vocational tractor applications. You may assign the numbers and  configurations of engines within the respective subfamilies at any time  before submitting the end-of-year report required by Sec.  1036.730. If  the family participates in averaging, banking, or trading, you must  identify the type of vehicle in which each engine is installed; we may  alternatively allow you to use statistical methods to determine this for  a fraction of your engines. Keep records to document this determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you restrict use of the test configuration for your split  family to only tractors, or only vocational vehicles, you must identify  a second testable configuration for the other type of vehicle (or an  unrestricted configuration). Identify this configuration in your  application for certification. The FCL for the engine family applies for   this configuration as well as the primary test configuration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Engine configurations within an engine family must use  equivalent greenhouse gas emission controls. Unless we approve it, you  may not produce nontested configurations without the same emission  control hardware included on the tested configuration. We will only  approve it if you demonstrate that the exclusion of the hardware does  not increase greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
