                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When authorized by an appropriation or  other statute to use 5 U.S.C. 3109, an agency may appoint a qualified  expert or consultant to an expert or consultant position that requires  only intermittent and/or temporary employment. Such an appointment is  excepted from competitive examination, position classification, and the  General Schedule pay rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An expert or consultant who works on a strictly intermittent  basis may be appointed under this authority without time limit or for  any period determined by the agency. All other experts and consultants  must receive temporary appointments. Temporary experts and consultants  may be reappointed in the same agency only as provided in paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inappropriate use. An agency must not use 5 U.S.C. 3109 to  appoint an expert or consultant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To a position requiring Presidential appointment. However,  subject to the conditions of this part, an agency may appoint an  individual awaiting final action on a Presidential appointment to an  expert or consultant position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To a Senior Executive Service position (including an FBI or DEA  Senior Executive Service position).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To perform managerial or supervisory work (although an expert  may act as team leader or director of the specific project for which he/ she is hired), to make final decisions on substantive policies, or to  otherwise function in the agency chain of command (e.g., to approve  financial transactions, personnel actions, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To do work performed by the agency's regular employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To fill in during staff shortages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Solely in anticipation of giving that individual a career  appointment. However, subject to the conditions of this part, an agency  may appoint an individual to an expert or consultant position pending  Schedule C appointment or noncareer appointment in the Senior Executive  Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reappointment. An agency may reemploy an expert or consultant to  perform demonstrably different duties without regard to the length of  that individual's previous expert or consultant service with the agency.  Reappointment to perform substantially the same duties is subject to the  following limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An agency may employ an expert or consultant who works on a  full-time basis for a maximum of 2 years--i.e., on an initial  appointment not to exceed 1   year and a reappointment not to exceed 1 additional year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agency may reappoint an expert or consultant who works on a  part-time or intermittent schedule in accordance with one of the  following options. The agency must determine which option it will use in  advance of any reappointment and must base its determination on  objective criteria (e.g., nature of duties, pay level, whether or not  work is regularly scheduled). Option 1 must be applied to reappointments  of experts and consultants appointed without compensation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Option 1--Annual service. An agency may reappoint an expert or  consultant, with no limit on the number of reappointments, as long as  the individual is paid for no more than 6 months (130 days or 1,040  hours) of work, or works for no more than that amount of time without  compensation, in a service year. (The service year is the calendar year  that begins on the date of the individual's initial appointment in the  agency.) An expert or consultant who exceeds this limit in his/her first  service year may be reappointed for 1 additional year. An expert or  consultant who exceeds the limit during any subsequent service year may  not be reappointed thereafter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Option 2--Cumulative earnings. Each expert or consultant will  have a lifetime limit of twice the maximum annual rate payable under the  annualized basic pay limitations of section 304.105. The agency may  adjust this limit to reflect statutory increases in basic pay rates. The  agency may reappoint an expert or consultant until his/her total  earnings from expert or consultant employment with the agency reach the  lifetime maximum, as determined by using the applicable maximum salary  rate. At that point, the employment must be terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OPM may authorize reappointment of an expert or consultant as an  exception to the limits in the section when necessitated by unforeseen  and unusual circumstances.</p>
