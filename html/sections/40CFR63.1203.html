Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:
DRE = [1-(Wout / Win)] x 100%
Where:
Win = mass feedrate of one principal organic hazardous</p><p class="depth0">constituent (POHC) in a waste feedstream; andWout = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust</p><p class="depth0">emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec.  261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).

most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of this section no longer apply after any of the following dates, whichever occurs first:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date that your source begins to comply with Sec.  63.1219 by placing a Documentation of Compliance in the operating record pursuant to Sec.  63.1211(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date that your source begins to comply with Sec.  63.1219 by submitting a Notification of Compliance pursuant to Sec.  63.1210(b); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The date for your source to comply with Sec.  63.1219 pursuant to Sec.  63.1206 and any extensions granted there under.[67 FR 6809, Feb. 13, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 59541, Oct. 12, 2005; 73 FR 18979, Apr. 8, 2008]</p>
