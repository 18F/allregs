                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Valuation of extensions of credit secured exclusively by affiliate securities. An extension of credit by a member bank to a nonaffiliate secured exclusively by securities issued by an affiliate of the member bank must be valued at the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total value of the extension of credit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fair market value of the securities issued by an affiliate that are pledged as collateral, if the member bank verifies that such securities meet the market quotation standard contained in paragraph (e) of Sec. 223.42 or the standards set forth in paragraphs (f)(1) and (5) of Sec. 223.42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of extensions of credit secured by affiliate securities and other collateral. An extension of credit by a member bank to a nonaffiliate secured in part by securities issued by an affiliate of the member bank and in part by nonaffiliate collateral must be valued at the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total value of the extension of credit less the fair market value of the nonaffiliate collateral; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fair market value of the securities issued by an affiliate that are pledged as collateral, if the member bank verifies that such securities meet the market quotation standard contained in paragraph (e) of Sec. 223.42 or the standards set forth in paragraphs (f)(1) and (5) of Sec. 223.42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exclusion of eligible affiliated mutual fund securities--(1) The exclusion. Eligible affiliated mutual fund securities are not considered to be securities issued by an affiliate, and are instead considered to be nonaffiliate collateral, for purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, unless the member bank knows or has reason to know that the proceeds of the extension of credit will be used to purchase the eligible affiliated mutual fund securities collateral or will otherwise be used for the benefit of or transferred to an affiliate of the member bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition. ``Eligible affiliated mutual fund securities'' with respect to a member bank are securities issued by an affiliate of the member bank that is

an open-end investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The securities issued by the investment company:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Meet the market quotation standard contained in paragraph (e) of Sec. 223.42;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Meet the standards set forth in paragraphs (f)(1) and (5) of Sec. 223.42; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Have closing prices that are made public through a mutual fund ``supermarket'' website maintained by an unaffiliated securities broker-dealer or mutual fund distributor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The member bank and its affiliates do not own or control in the aggregate more than 5 percent of any class of voting securities or of the equity capital of the investment company (excluding securities held by the member bank or an affiliate in good faith in a fiduciary capacity, unless the member bank or affiliate holds the securities for the benefit of the member bank or affiliate, or the shareholders, employees, or subsidiaries of the member bank or affiliate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. A member bank proposes to lend $100 to a nonaffiliate secured exclusively by eligible affiliated mutual fund securities. The member bank knows that the nonaffiliate intends to use all the loan proceeds to purchase the eligible affiliated mutual fund securities that would serve as collateral for the loan. Under the attribution rule in Sec. 223.16, the member bank must treat the loan to the nonaffiliate as a loan to an affiliate, and, because securities issued by an affiliate are ineligible collateral under Sec. 223.14, the loan would not be in compliance with Sec. 223.14.</p>
