                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for claim. A patent or copyright infringement claim  for compensation, asserted against the United States as represented by  NASA under any of the applicable statutes cited above, must be actually  communicated to and received by an organization, office, or within a  NASA Center. Claims must be in writing and must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An allegation of infringement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for compensation, either expressed or implied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A citation to the patent(s) or copyright(s) alleged to be  infringed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a patent infringement claim, a sufficient  designation to permit identification of the accused subject matter (e.g.  article(s) or process(es)) alleged to infringe the patent(s), giving the  commercial designation, if known to the claimant, or, in the case of a  copyright infringement claim, the accused subject matter (e.g. act(s) or  work(s)) alleged to infringe the copyright.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of a patent infringement claim, a designation of at  least one claim of each patent alleged to be infringed or, in the case  of a copyright infringement claim, a copy of each work alleged to be  infringed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As an alternative to paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section,  certification that the claimant has made a bona fide attempt to  determine the accused subject matter, which is alleged to infringe the  patent(s), or the accused subject matter alleged to infringe the  copyright(s), but was unable to do so, giving reasons and stating a  reasonable basis for the claimant's belief that the patent(s) or  copyright(s) is being infringed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional information for patent infringement claims. In  addition to the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the  following material and information generally are necessary in the course  of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are encouraged  to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to permit  rapid processing and resolution of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all  claims of the patent(s) alleged to be infringed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of all procurements known to the claimants that  involve the accused item(s) or process(es), including the identity of  the vendor(s) or contractor(s) and the Government acquisition activity  or activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A detailed identification and description of the accused  article(s) or process(es) used or acquired by the Government,  particularly where the article(s) or process(es) relate to a  component(s) or subcomponent(s) of an item acquired, and an element-by- element comparison of representative claim(s) with the accused  article(s) or process(es). If available, the identification and  description should include documentation and drawings to illustrate the  accused article(s) or process(es) in sufficient detail to enable  determining whether the claim(s) of the asserted patent(s) read on the  accused article(s) or process(es).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Names and addresses of all past and present licensees under the  patent(s) and copies of all license agreements and releases involving  the patent(s). In addition, an identification of all assignees of the  patent(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A list of all persons to whom notices of infringement have been  sent, including all departments and agencies of the Government, and a  statement of the status or ultimate disposition of each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A brief description of all litigation involving the patent(s)  which was   initiated at any time prior to the claim being filed and their present  status. This includes any defenses or counterclaims made and positions  maintained by opposing parties regarding invalidity of the patent(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A description of Government employment or military service, if  any, by the inventor(s) or patent owner(s) including a statement from  the inventor(s) or patent owner(s) certifying whether the invention  claimed in the patents was conceived or reduced to practice, in part or  in whole, during Government employment and whether such inventor(s) or  owner(s) occupied any position from which such inventor(s) or owner(s)  was capable of ordering, influencing, or inducing use of the invention  by the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A list of all contract(s) between the Government and  inventor(s), patent owner(s), or anyone in privity with the patent  owner(s), under which work relating to the patented subject matter was  performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Evidence of title to the asserted patent(s) or other right to  make the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A copy of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)  file history of each patent, if it is available to the claimant.  Indicate whether the patent has been the subject of any interference  proceedings, certification of correction request, reexamination, or  reissue proceedings at the USPTO, or lapsed for failure to pay any  maintenance fee. In addition, the status of all corresponding foreign  patents and patent applications and full copies of the same.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Pertinent prior art known to the claimant not contained in the  USPTO file, for example, publications and foreign prior art. In addition  to the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the  investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused  article(s) or process(es) or to a specific acquisition (e.g. identified  contract(s)), it may speed disposition of the claim. Claimants are also  encouraged to provide information on any ancillary matters that may have  a bearing on validity or infringement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Denial for refusal to provide information. In the course of  investigating a claim, it may become necessary for NASA to request  information in the control and custody of the claimant that is relevant  to the disposition of the claim. Failure of the claimant to respond to a  request for such information shall be sufficient reason alone for  denying a claim.</p>
