                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the FOIA, as amended, there are four categories of FOIA  requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial  scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all  other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each  category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commercial use requesters. For commercial use requesters, the  Committee shall assess charges which recover the full direct costs of  searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records  sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free  search time nor 100 free   pages of reproduction of documents referenced in Sec. 51-8.12(c)(1).  The Committee may charge for the cost of searching for and reviewing  records for commercial use requesters even if there is ultimately no  disclosure of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A commercial use requester is defined as one who seeks  information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or  profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the  request is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this  category the Committee must determine whether the requester will put the  documents to a commercial use. Where the Committee has reasonable cause  to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or  where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Committee may  seek additional clarification from the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Educational and non-commercial scientific institution  requesters. Fees for this category of requesters shall be limited to the  cost of providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the  first 100 reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for search or review  services. To qualify for this category, requesters must show that the  request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of an  eligible institution and that the records are not sought for a  commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research (if  the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a  public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of  graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher  education, an institution of professional education, and an institution  of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of  scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an  institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, and which is  operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the  results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or  industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requesters who are representatives of the news media--Fees for  this category of requesters shall also be limited to the cost of  providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100  reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for providing search for  review services. Requests in this category must not be made for a  commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any  person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and  operated to publish or broadcast news to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``news'' means information that is about current events  or that would be of current interest to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of news media entities include television or radio  stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of  periodicals which disseminate news and who make their products available  for purchase or subscription by the general public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded as working for a news  organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting  publication through that organization, even though not actually employed  by it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All other requesters. Fees for requesters who do not fit into  any of the above categories shall be assessed for the full reasonable  direct cost of searching for and duplicating documents that are  responsive to a request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction  and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without  charge.</p>
