                            <p class="depth0">A taxpayer engaged in mining or manufacturing who by a single  process or uniform series of processes derives a product of two or more  kinds, sizes, or grades, the unit cost of which is substantially alike,  and who in conformity to a recognized trade practice allocates an amount  of cost to each kind, size, or grade of product, which in the aggregate  will absorb the total cost of production, may, with the consent of the  Commissioner, use such allocated cost as a basis for pricing  inventories, provided such allocation bears a reasonable relation to the  respective selling values of the different kinds, sizes, or grades of  product. See section 472 as to last-in, first-out inventories.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11726, Nov. 26, 1960]</p>
