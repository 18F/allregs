Temporary limited appointments under this section are permitted only at the grade levels authorized for VRA appointments. Such appointments are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion to career-conditional appointment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Career-conditional appointment under Sec. 315.601, 315.604, 315.605, 315.606, 315.607, 315.608, 315.609, 315.612, 315.703, or 315.711 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 (veterans with compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent of more).

An agency may not reappoint a former temporary employee if the individual has already served the maximum time allowed in Sec. 316.401 or if the position has been filled under temporary appointment for the maximum time allowed in Sec. 316.401. Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Reappointment on the basis of being a former temporary employee who was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under the provisions of part 333 of this chapter and who sustained a compensable injury while serving on the temporary appointment. Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements. If the compensable injury disqualifies the former individual from performing such a position, reappointment may be to any position for which the individual is qualified. Reappointment must be for a minimum of 120 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension of temporary appointments. An individual who receives a valid temporary appointment will be eligible for an extension in accordance with Sec. 316.401 even if his or her eligibility for noncompetitive appointment expires or is lost during the authorized period of temporary employment.
