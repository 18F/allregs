                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase test system is a device intended to measure the activity of the enzyme alpha-hydroxybutric dehydrogenase (HBD) in plasma or serum. HBD measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction, renal damage (such as rejection of transplants), certain hematological diseases (such as acute leukemias and megaloblastic anemias) and, to a lesser degree, liver disease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in Sec.  862.9.

Sec.  862.1385  17-Hydroxycorticosteroids (17-ketogenic steroids) test system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-ketogenic steroids) test system is a device intended to measure corticosteroids that possess a dihydroxyacetone[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01FE93.028

moiety on the steroid nucleus in urine. Corticosteroids with this chemical configuration include cortisol, cortisone 11-desoxycortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and their tetrahydroderivatives. This group of hormones is synthesized by the adrenal gland. Measurements of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-ketogenic steroids) are used in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases of the adrenal or pituitary glands and gonadal disorders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to Sec.  862.9.
