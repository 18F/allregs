                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Enrollment requirement for veterans. (1) Except as otherwise  provided in Sec.  17.37, a veteran must be enrolled in the VA healthcare  system as a condition for receiving the 'medical benefits package' set  forth in Sec.  17.38.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(1): A veteran may apply to be enrolled at any  time. (See Sec.  17.36(d)(1).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a  veteran enrolled under this section and who, if required by law to do  so, has agreed to make any applicable copayment is eligible for VA  hospital and outpatient care as provided in the ``medical benefits  package'' set forth in Sec.  17.38.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(2): A veteran's enrollment status will be  recognized throughout the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A veteran enrolled based on having a disorder associated with  exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated  with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf  War (the period between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998), or any  illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or  during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided in 38  U.S.C. 1710(e), is eligible for VA care provided in the ``medical  benefits package'' set forth in Sec.  17.38 for the disorder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Categories of veterans eligible to be enrolled. The Secretary  will determine which categories of veterans are eligible to be enrolled  based on the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 50 percent or  greater based on one or more service-connected disabilities or  unemployability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40  percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Veterans who are former prisoners of war; veterans awarded the  Medal of Honor or Purple Heart; veterans with a singular or combined  rating of 10 percent or 20 percent based on one or more service- connected disabilities; veterans who were discharged or released from  active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the  line of duty; veterans who receive disability compensation under 38  U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is  suspended pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1151, but only to the extent that such  veterans' continuing eligibility for that care is provided for in the  judgment or settlement described in 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose  entitlement to disability compensation is suspended because of the  receipt of military retired pay; and veterans receiving compensation at  the 10 percent rating level based on multiple noncompensable service- connected disabilities that clearly interfere with normal employability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Veterans who receive increased pension based on their need for  regular aid and attendance or by reason of   being permanently housebound and other veterans who are determined to be  catastrophically disabled by the Chief of Staff (or equivalent clinical  official) at the VA facility where they were examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Veterans not covered by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this  section who are determined to be unable to defray the expenses of  necessary care under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Veterans of the Mexican border period or of World War I;  veterans solely seeking care for a disorder associated with exposure to  a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service  in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War (the  period between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998), or for any  illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or  during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided and  limited in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e); Camp Lejeune veterans pursuant to Sec.   17.400; and veterans with 0 percent service-connected disabilities who  are nevertheless compensated, including veterans receiving compensation  for inactive tuberculosis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Veterans who agree to pay to the United States the applicable  copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g) if their income  for the previous year constitutes ``low income'' under the geographical  income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development for the fiscal year that ended on September 30 of the  previous calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, VA will  determine the income of veterans (to include the income of their spouses  and dependents) using the rules in Sec. Sec.  3.271, 3.272, 3.273, and  3.276. After determining the veterans' income and the number of persons  in the veterans' family (including only the spouse and dependent  children), VA will compare their income with the current applicable  ``low-income'' income limit for the public housing and section 8  programs in their area that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development publishes pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). If the  veteran's income is below the applicable ``low-income'' income limits  for the area in which the veteran resides, the veteran will be  considered to have ``low income'' for purposes of this paragraph. To  avoid a hardship to a veteran, VA may use the projected income for the  current year of the veteran, spouse, and dependent children if the  projected income is below the ``low income'' income limit referenced  above. This category is further prioritized into the following  subcategories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who are  in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in a Federal  Register document promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and  who subsequently do not request disenrollment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonservice-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on  a specified date announced in a Federal Register document promulgated  under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request  disenrollment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not  included in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph  (b)(7)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Veterans not included in priority category 4 or 7, who are  eligible for care only if they agree to pay to the United States the  applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g).  This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who were  in an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a  higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible  for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who  subsequently do not request disenrollment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not  included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section and whose income is not  greater than ten percent more than the income that would permit their  enrollment in priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is  higher;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonservice-connected veterans who were in an enrolled status  on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a   higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible  for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who  subsequently do not request disenrollment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph  (b)(8)(iii) of this section and whose income is not greater than ten  percent more than the income that would permit their enrollment in  priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is higher;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not  included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) or paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph  (b)(8)(iii) or paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federal Register notification of eligible enrollees.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is  anticipated that each year the Secretary will consider whether to change  the categories and subcategories of veterans eligible to be enrolled.  The Secretary at any time may revise the categories or subcategories of  veterans eligible to be enrolled by amending paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. The preamble to a Federal Register document announcing which  priority categories and subcategories are eligible to be enrolled must  specify the projected number of fiscal year applicants for enrollment in  each priority category, projected healthcare utilization and  expenditures for veterans in each priority category, appropriated funds  and other revenue projected to be available for fiscal year enrollees,  and projected total expenditures for enrollees by priority category. The  determination should include consideration of relevant internal and  external factors, e.g., economic changes, changes in medical practices,  and waiting times to obtain an appointment for care. Consistent with  these criteria, the Secretary will determine which categories of  veterans are eligible to be enrolled based on the order of priority  specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless changed by a rulemaking document in accordance with  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, VA will enroll the priority categories  of veterans set forth in Sec.  17.36(b) beginning June 15, 2009, except  that those veterans in subcategories (v) and (vi) of priority category 8  are not eligible to be enrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Enrollment and disenrollment process--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application for  enrollment. A veteran may apply to be enrolled in the VA healthcare  system at any time. A veteran who wishes to be enrolled must apply by  submitting a VA Form 10-10EZ to a VA medical facility or via an Online  submission at https://www.1010ez.med.va.gov/sec/vha/1010ez/.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. Upon determining that a  veteran is not in a priority category eligible to be enrolled, the VA  network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health  for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or  equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health  Eligibility Center, will inform the applicant that the applicant is  ineligible to be enrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Placement in enrollment categories. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Veterans will be placed  in priority categories whether or not veterans in that category are  eligible to be enrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A veteran will be placed in the highest priority category or  categories for which the veteran qualifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A veteran may be placed in only one priority category, except  that a veteran placed in priority category 6 based on a specified  disorder or illness will also be placed in priority category 7 or  priority category 8, as applicable, if the veteran has previously agreed  to pay the applicable copayment, for all matters not covered by priority  category 6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A veteran who had been enrolled based on inclusion in priority  category 5 and became no longer eligible for inclusion in priority  category 5 due to failure to submit to VA a current VA   Form 10-10EZ will be changed automatically to enrollment based on  inclusion in priority category 6 or 8 (or more than one of these  categories if the previous principle applies), as applicable, and be  considered continuously enrolled. To meet the criteria for priority  category 5, a veteran must be eligible for priority category 5 based on  the information submitted to VA in a current VA Form 10-10EZ. To be  current, after VA has sent a form 10-10EZ to the veteran at the  veteran's last known address, the veteran must return the completed form  (including signature) to the address on the return envelope within 60  days from the date VA sent the form to the veteran.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Veterans will be disenrolled, and reenrolled, in the order of  the priority categories listed with veterans in priority category 1  being the last to be disenrolled and the first to be reenrolled.  Similarly, within priority categories 7 and 8, veterans will be  disenrolled, and reenrolled, in the order of the priority subcategories  listed with veterans in subcategory (i) being the last to be disenrolled  and first to be reenrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disenrollment. A veteran enrolled in the VA health care system  under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be disenrolled only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The veteran submits to a VA Medical Center or to the VA Health  Eligibility Center, 2957 Clairmont Road, NE., Suite 200, Atlanta,  Georgia 30329-1647, a signed and dated document stating that the veteran  no longer wishes to be enrolled; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under  Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health  Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility,  or Director, Health Eligibility Center, determines that the veteran is  no longer in a priority category eligible to be enrolled, as set forth  in Sec.  17.36(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notification of enrollment status. Notice of a decision by a VA  network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health  for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or  equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health  Eligibility Center, regarding enrollment status will be provided to the  affected veteran by letter and will contain the reasons for the  decision. The letter will include an effective date for any changes and  a statement regarding appeal rights. The decision will be based on all  information available to the decisionmaker, including the information  contained in VA Form 10-10EZ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this  section by a current medical examination that documents that the patient  meets the permanent criteria and will continue to meet such criteria  (permanently) or would continue to meet such criteria (permanently)  without the continuation of on-going treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Quadriplegia and quadriparesis; paraplegia; legal blindness  defined as visual impairment of 20/200 or less visual acuity in the  better seeing eye with corrective lenses, or a visual field restriction  of 20 degrees or less in the better seeing eye with corrective lenses;  persistent vegetative state; or a condition resulting from two of the  following procedures, provided the two procedures were not on the same  limb:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amputation, detachment, or reamputation of or through the hand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disarticulation, detachment, or reamputation of or through the  wrist;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amputation, detachment, or reamputation of the forearm at or  through the radius and ulna;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amputation, detachment, or disarticulation of the forearm at or  through the elbow;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Amputation, detachment, or reamputation of the arm at or through  the humerus;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Disarticulation or detachment of the arm at or through the  shoulder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Interthoracoscapular (forequarter) amputation or detachment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Amputation, detachment, or reamputation of the leg at or  through the tibia and fibula;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Amputation or detachment of or through the great toe;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Amputation or detachment of or through the foot;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Disarticulation or detachment of the foot at or through the  ankle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Amputation or detachment of the foot at or through malleoli of  the tibia and fibula;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Amputation or detachment of the lower leg at or through the  knee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Amputation, detachment, or reamputation of the leg at or  through the femur;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Disarticulation or detachment of the leg at or through the hip;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Interpelviaabdominal (hindquarter) amputation or detachment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dependent in 3 or more Activities of Daily Living (eating,  dressing, bathing, toileting, transferring, incontinence of bowel and/or  bladder), with at least 3 of the dependencies being permanent with a  rating of 1, using the Katz scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A score of 2 or lower on at least 4 of the 13 motor items using  the Functional Independence Measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A score of 30 or lower using the Global Assessment of  Functioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> VA Form 10-10EZ.
