A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history (36 CFR 60.3(d)). The historic district must be included in or be determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Historic property means any pre-historic or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in or been determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior (36 CFR 800.16(l)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> National Register of Historic Places means the National Register of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to expand and maintain under the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 60.1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The offer of space must meet the terms and conditions of this solicitation.
