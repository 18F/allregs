                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reserve requirement. If you are an Early Stage SBIC with  outstanding Leverage, for each Debenture which requires periodic  interest payments to SBA during the first five years of its term, you  must maintain a reserve sufficient to pay the interest and Charges on  such Debenture for the first 21 Payment Dates following the date of  issuance. This reserve may consist of any combination of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Binding unfunded commitments from your Institutional Investors  that cannot be called for any purpose other than the payment of interest  and Charges to SBA, or the payment of any amounts due to SBA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cash maintained in a separate bank account or separate  investment account permitted under Sec. 107.530 of this part and  separately identified in your financial statements as ``restricted  cash'' available only for the purpose of paying interest and Charges to  SBA, or for the payment of any amounts due to SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The required reserve associated with an individual Debenture  shall be reduced on each Payment Date upon payment of the required  interest and Charges. If you prepay a Debenture prior to the 21st  Payment Date following its date of issuance, the reserve requirement  associated with that Debenture shall be correspondingly eliminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your limited partnership agreement must incorporate the reserve  requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
