                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An analog telephone complies with the Commission's volume  control requirements if the telephone is equipped with a receive volume  control that provides, through the receiver in the handset or headset of  the telephone, 12 dB of gain minimum and up to 18 dB of gain maximum,  when measured in terms of Receive Objective Loudness Rating (ROLR), as  defined in paragraph 4.1.2 of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 (Telephone Instruments  With Loop Signaling) . The 12 dB of gain minimum must be achieved  without significant clipping of the test signal. The telephone also  shall comply with the upper and lower limits for ROLR given in table 4.4  of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 when the receive volume control is set to its  normal unamplified level.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (a): Paragraph 4.1.2 of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987  identifies several characteristics related to the receive response of a  telephone. It is only the normal unamplified ROLR level and the change  in ROLR as a function of the volume control setting that are relevant to  the specification of volume control as required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ROLR of an analog telephone shall be determined over the  frequency range from 300 to 3300 HZ for short, average, and long loop  conditions represented by 0, 2.7, and 4.6 km of 26 AWG nonloaded cable,  respectively. The specified length of cable will be simulated by a  complex impedance. (See Figure A.) The input level to the cable  simulator shall be -10 dB with respect to 1 V open circuit from a 900  ohm source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A digital telephone complies with the Commission's volume  control requirements if the telephone is equipped with a receive volume  control that provides, through the receiver of the handset or headset of  the telephone, 12 dB of gain minimum and up to 18 dB of gain maximum,  when measured in terms of Receive Objective Loudness Rating (ROLR), as  defined in paragraph 4.3.2 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991 (Acoustic-To-Digital  and Digital-To-Acoustic Transmission Requirements for ISDN Terminals).  The 12 dB of gain minimum must be achieved without significant clipping  of the test signal. The telephone also shall comply with the limits on  the range for ROLR given in paragraph 4.3.2.2 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991  when the receive volume control is set to its normal unamplified level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ROLR of a digital telephone shall be determined over the  frequency range from 300 to 3300 Hz using the method described in  paragraph 4.3.2.1 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991. No variation in loop  conditions is required for this measurement since the receive level of a  digital telephone is independent of loop length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The ROLR for either an analog or digital telephone shall first  be determined with the receive volume control at its normal unamplified  level. The minimum volume control setting shall be used for this  measurement unless the manufacturer identifies a different setting for  the nominal volume level. The ROLR shall then be determined with the  receive volume control at its maximum volume setting. Since ROLR is a  loudness rating value expressed in dB of loss, more positive values of  ROLR represent lower receive levels. Therefore, the ROLR value  determined for the maximum volume control setting should be subtracted  from that determined for the nominal volume control setting to determine  compliance with the gain requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The 18 dB of receive gain may be exceeded provided that the  amplified receive capability automatically resets to nominal gain when  the telephone is caused to pass through a proper on-hook transition in  order to minimize the likelihood of damage to individuals with normal  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> These incorporations by reference of paragraph 4.1.2 (including  table 4.4) of American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard  ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 and paragraph 4.3.2 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991 were  approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5  U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
