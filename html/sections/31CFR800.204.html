                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term control means the power, direct or indirect, whether or  not exercised, through the ownership of a majority or a dominant  minority of the total outstanding voting interest in an entity, board  representation, proxy voting, a special share, contractual arrangements,  formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, or other means, to  determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting an entity; in  particular, but without limitation, to determine, direct, take, reach,  or cause decisions regarding the following matters, or any other  similarly important matters affecting an entity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, or other transfer of any of  the tangible or intangible principal assets of the entity, whether or  not in the ordinary course of business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reorganization, merger, or dissolution of the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The closing, relocation, or substantial alteration of the  production, operational, or research and development facilities of the  entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Major expenditures or investments, issuances of equity or debt,  or dividend payments by the entity, or approval of the operating budget  of the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The selection of new business lines or ventures that the entity  will pursue;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The entry into, termination, or non-fulfillment by the entity of  significant contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The policies or procedures of the entity governing the treatment  of non-public technical, financial, or other proprietary information of  the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The appointment or dismissal of officers or senior managers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The appointment or dismissal of employees with access to  sensitive technology or classified U.S. Government information; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, constituent  agreement, or other organizational documents of the entity with respect  to the matters described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In examining questions of control in situations where more than  one foreign person has an ownership interest in an entity, consideration  will be given to factors such as whether the foreign persons are related  or have formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, whether they  are agencies or instrumentalities of the national or subnational  governments of a single foreign state, and whether a given foreign  person and another person that has an ownership interest in the entity  are both controlled by any of the national or subnational governments of  a single foreign state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following minority shareholder protections shall not in  themselves be deemed to confer control over an entity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially  all of the assets of an entity or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or  liquidation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The power to prevent an entity from entering into contracts with  majority investors or their affiliates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The power to prevent an entity from guaranteeing the obligations  of majority investors or their affiliates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The power to purchase an additional interest in an entity to  prevent the dilution of an investor's pro rata interest in that entity  in the event that the entity issues additional instruments conveying  interests in the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The power to prevent the change of existing legal rights or  preferences of the particular class of stock held by minority investors,  as provided in the relevant corporate documents governing such shares;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The power to prevent the amendment of the Articles of  Incorporation, constituent agreement, or other organizational documents  of an entity with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (c)(1)  through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Committee will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether  minority shareholder protections other than those listed in paragraph  (c) of this section do not confer control over an entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any transaction in which a foreign person acquires an additional  interest in a U.S. business that was previously the subject of a covered  transaction for which the Committee concluded all action under section  721 shall not be deemed to be a transaction that could result in foreign  control over that U.S. business (i.e., it is not a covered transaction).  However, if a foreign person that did not acquire control of the U.S.  business in the prior transaction is a party to the later transaction,  the later transaction may be a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A is a U.S. business. A U.S. investor owns 50  percent of the voting interest in Corporation A, and the remaining  voting interest is owned in equal shares by five unrelated foreign  investors. The foreign investors jointly financed their investment in  Corporation A and vote as a single block on matters affecting  Corporation A. The foreign investors have an informal arrangement to act  in concert with regard to Corporation A, and, as a result, the foreign  investors control Corporation A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1 with regard to the composition  of Corporation A's shareholders. The foreign investors in Corporation A  have no contractual or other commitments to act in concert, and have no  informal arrangements to do so. Assuming no other relevant facts, the  foreign investors do not control Corporation A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, is a private equity fund  that routinely acquires substantial interests in companies and manages  them for a period of time. Corporation B is a U.S. business. In addition  to its acquisition of seven percent of Corporation B's voting shares,  Corporation A acquires the right to terminate significant contracts of  Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a nine percent  interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. As part of the  transaction, Corporation A also acquires certain veto rights that  determine important matters affecting Corporation B, including the right  to veto the dismissal of senior executives of Corporation B. Corporation  A controls Corporation B.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a thirteen  percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, and  the right to appoint one member of Corporation B's seven-member Board of  Directors. Corporation A receives minority shareholder protections  listed in Sec. 800.204(c), but receives no other positive or negative  rights with respect to Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts,  Corporation A does not control Corporation B.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a twenty  percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business.  Corporation A has negotiated an irrevocable passivity agreement that  completely precludes it from controlling Corporation B. Corporation A  does, however, receive the right to prevent Corporation B from entering  into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates and to  prevent Corporation B from guaranteeing the obligations of majority  investors or their affiliates. Assuming no other relevant facts,  Corporation A does not control Corporation B.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 40 percent  interest and important rights in Corporation B, a U.S. business. The  documentation pertaining to the transaction gives no indication that  Corporation A's interest in Corporation B may increase at a later date.  Following its review of the transaction, the Committee informs the  parties that the notified transaction is a covered transaction, and  concludes action under section 721. Three years later, Corporation A  acquires the remainder of the voting interest in Corporation B. Assuming  no other relevant facts, because the Committee concluded all action with  respect to Corporation A's earlier investment in the same U.S. business,  and because no other foreign person is a party to this subsequent  transaction, this subsequent transaction is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Limited Partnership A comprises two limited partners,  each of which holds 49 percent of the interest in the partnership, and a  general partner, which holds two percent of the interest. The general  partner has sole authority to determine, direct, and decide important  matters affecting the partnership and a fund operated by the  partnership. The general partner alone controls Limited Partnership A  and the fund.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. Same facts as in Example 8, except that each of the  limited partners has the authority to veto major investments proposed by  the general partner and to choose the fund's representatives on the  boards of the fund's portfolio companies. The general partner and the  limited partners each have control over Limited Partnership A and the  fund.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 800.204: See Sec. 800.302(b) regarding the  Committee's treatment of transactions in which a foreign person holds or  acquires ten percent or less of the outstanding voting interest in a  U.S. business solely for the purpose of passive investment.</p>
