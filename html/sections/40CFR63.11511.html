                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Batch electrolytic process tank means a tank used for an  electrolytic process in which a part or group of parts, typically  mounted on racks or placed in barrels, is placed in the tank and  immersed in an electrolytic process solution as a single unit (i.e., as  a batch) for a predetermined period of time, during which none of the  parts are removed from the tank and no other parts are added to the  tank, and after which the part or parts are removed from the tank as a  unit.</p><p class="depth0">Bath means the liquid contents of a tank, as defined in this  section, which is used for electroplating, electroforming,  electropolishing, or other metal coating processes at a plating and  polishing facility.</p><p class="depth0">Bench-scale means any operation that is small enough to be performed  on a bench, table, or similar structure so that the equipment is not  directly contacting the floor.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the collection of components used to capture  gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then  convey the captured gas stream to a control device, as part of a  complete control system. A capture system may include, but is not  limited to, the following components as applicable to a given capture  system design: duct intake devices, hoods, enclosures, ductwork,  dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.</p><p class="depth0">Cartridge filter means a type of control device that uses perforated  metal cartridges containing a pleated paper or non-woven fibrous filter  media to remove PM from a gas stream by sieving and other mechanisms.  Cartridge filters can be designed with single use cartridges, which are  removed and disposed after reaching capacity, or continuous use  cartridges, which typically are cleaned by means of a pulse-jet  mechanism.</p><p class="depth0">Composite mesh pad means a type of control device similar to a mesh  pad mist eliminator except that the device is designed with multiple  pads in series that are woven with layers of material with varying fiber  diameters, which produce a coalescing effect on the droplets or PM that  impinge upon the pads.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous electrolytic process tank means a tank that uses an  electrolytic process and in which a continuous metal strip or other type  of continuous substrate is fed into and removed from the tank  continuously. This process is also called reel-to-reel electrolytic  plating.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means equipment that is part of a control system that  collects and/or reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to  the air. The control device receives emissions that are transported from  the process by the capture system.</p><p class="depth0">Control system means the combination of a capture system and a  control device. The capture system is designed to collect and transport  air emissions from the affected source to the control device. The  overall control efficiency of any control system is a combination of the  ability of the system to capture the air emissions (i.e., the capture  efficiency) and the control device efficiency. Consequently, it is  important to achieve good capture to ensure good overall control  efficiency. Capture devices that are known to provide high capture  efficiencies include hoods, enclosures, or any other duct intake devices  with ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, or fans.</p><p class="depth0">Conversion coatings are coatings that form a hard metal finish on an  object when the object is submerged in a tank bath or solution that  contains the conversion coatings. Conversion coatings for the purposes  of this rule include coatings composed of chromium, as well as the other  plating and polishing metal HAP, where no electrical current is used.</p><p class="depth0">Cyanide plating means plating processes performed in tanks that use  cyanide as a major bath ingredient and that operate at pH of 12 or more,  and use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined  in this section. Electroplating and electroforming are performed with or  without cyanide. The cyanide in the bath works to dissolve the HAP metal  added as a cyanide compound (e.g., cadmium cyanide) and creates free  cyanide in solution, which helps to corrode   the anode. These tanks are self-regulating to a pH of 12 due to the  caustic nature of the cyanide bath chemistry. The cyanide in the bath is  a major bath constituent and not an additive; however, the self- regulating chemistry of the bath causes the bath to act as if wetting  agents/fume suppressants are being used and to ensure an optimum plating  process. All cyanide plating baths at pH greater than or equal to 12  have cyanide-metal complexes in solution. The metal HAP to be plated is  not emitted because it is either bound in the metal-cyanide complex or  reduced at the cathode to elemental metal, and plated onto the immersed  parts. Cyanide baths are not intentionally operated at pH less 12 since  unfavorable plating conditions would occur in the tank, among other  negative effects.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source or an owner  or operator of such an affected source:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this  rule including, but not limited to, any equipment standard (including  emissions and operating limits), management practice, or operation and  maintenance requirement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement  an applicable requirement in this rule and that is included in the  operating permit for any affected facility required to obtain such a  permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any equipment standard (including emission and  operating limits), management standard, or operation and maintenance  requirement in this rule during startup, shutdown, or malfunction.</p><p class="depth2">Dry mechanical polishing means a process used for removing defects  from and smoothing the surface of finished metals and formed products  after plating or thermal spraying with any of the plating and polishing  metal HAP, as defined in this section, using automatic or manually- operated machines that have hard-faced abrasive wheels or belts and  where no liquids or fluids are used to trap the removed metal particles.  The affected process does not include polishing with use of pastes,  liquids, lubricants, or any other added materials.</p><p class="depth2">Electroforming means an electrolytic process using or emitting any  of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, that  is used for fabricating metal parts. This process is essentially the  same as electroplating except that the plated substrate (mandrel) is  removed, leaving only the metal plate. In electroforming, the metal  plate is self-supporting and generally thicker than in electroplating.</p><p class="depth2">Electroless plating means a non-electrolytic process that uses or  emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this  section, in which metallic ions in a plating bath or solution are  reduced to form a metal coating at the surface of a catalytic substrate  without the use of external electrical energy. Electroless plating is  also called non-electrolytic plating. Examples include, but are not  limited to, chromate conversion coating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium  dichromate sealing, and manganese phosphate coating.</p><p class="depth2">Electrolytic plating processes means electroplating and  electroforming that use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal  HAP, as defined in this section, where metallic ions in a plating bath  or solution are reduced to form a metal coating on the surface of parts  and products using electrical energy.</p><p class="depth2">Electroplating means an electrolytic process that uses or emits any  of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, in  which metal ions in solution are reduced onto the surface of the work  piece (the cathode) via an electrical current. The metal ions in the  solution are usually replenished by the dissolution of metal from solid  metal anodes fabricated of the same metal being plated, or by direct  replenishment of the solution with metal salts or oxides; electroplating  is also called electrolytic plating.</p><p class="depth2">Electropolishing means an electrolytic process performed in a tank  after plating that uses or emits any of the plating and polishing metal  HAP, as defined in this section, in which a work piece is attached to an  anode immersed in a bath, and the metal substrate is dissolved  electrolytically, thereby removing the surface contaminant;   electropolishing is also called electrolytic polishing. For the purposes  of this subpart, electropolishing does not include bench-scale  operations.</p><p class="depth2">Fabric filter means a type of control device used for collecting PM  by filtering a process exhaust stream through a filter or filter media.  A fabric filter is also known as a baghouse.</p><p class="depth2">Filters, for the purposes of this part, include cartridge, fabric,  or HEPA filters, as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth2">Flash electroplating means an electrolytic process performed in a  tank that uses or emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as  defined in this section, and that is used no more than 3 cumulative  minutes per hour or no more than 1 cumulative hour per day.</p><p class="depth2">General Provisions of this part (40 CFR part 63, subpart A) means  the section of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that addresses air  pollution rules that apply to all HAP sources addressed in part 63,  which includes the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air  Pollutants (NESHAP).</p><p class="depth2">HAP means hazardous air pollutant as defined from the list of 188  chemicals and compounds specified in the CAA Amendments of 1990; HAP are  also called ``air toxics.'' The five plating and polishing metal HAP, as  defined in this section, are on this list of 188 chemicals.</p><p class="depth2">High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter means a type of  control device that uses a filter composed of a mat of randomly arranged  fibers and is designed to remove at least 99.97 percent of airborne  particles that are 0.3 micrometers or larger in diameter.</p><p class="depth2">Maintenance is any process at a plating and polishing facility that  is performed to keep the process equipment or the facility operating  properly and is not performed on items to be sold as products.</p><p class="depth2">Major facility for HAP is any facility that emits greater than 10  tpy of any HAP, or that emits a combined total of all HAP of over 25  tpy, where the HAP used to determine the total facility emissions are  not restricted to only plating and polishing metal HAP or from only  plating and polishing operations.</p><p class="depth2">Mesh pad mist eliminator means a type of control device, consisting  of layers of interlocked filaments densely packed between two supporting  grids that remove liquid droplets and PM from the gas stream through  inertial impaction and direct interception.</p><p class="depth2">Metal coating operation means any process performed either in a tank  that contains liquids or as part of a thermal spraying operation, that  applies one or more plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this  section, to the surface of parts and products used in manufacturing.  These processes include but are not limited to: non-chromium  electroplating; electroforming; electropolishing; non-electrolytic metal  coating processes, such as chromate conversion coating, electroless  nickel plating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and  manganese phosphate coating; and thermal or flame spraying.</p><p class="depth2">Metal HAP content of material used in plating and polishing is the  HAP content as determined from an analysis or engineering estimate of  the HAP contents of the tank bath or solution, in the case of plating,  metal coating, or electropolishing; or the HAP content of the metal  coating being applied in the case of thermal spraying. Safety data sheet  (SDS) information may be used in lieu of testing or engineering  estimates but is not required to be used.</p><p class="depth2">New source means any affected source for which you commenced  construction or reconstruction after March 14, 2008.</p><p class="depth2">Non-cyanide electrolytic plating and electropolishing processes  means electroplating, electroforming, and electropolishing that uses or  emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this  section, performed without cyanide in the tank. These processes do not  use cyanide in the tank and operate at pH values less than 12. These  processes use electricity and add or remove metals such as metal HAP  from parts and products used in manufacturing. Both electroplating and  electroforming can be performed with cyanide as well.</p><p class="depth2">Non-electrolytic plating means a process that uses or emits any of  the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, in  which metallic ions in a plating bath or solution are reduced to form a  metal coating at the   surface of a catalytic substrate without the use of external electrical  energy. Non-electrolytic plating is also called electroless plating.  Examples include chromate conversion coating, nickel acetate sealing,  electroless nickel plating, sodium dichromate sealing, and manganese  phosphate coating.</p><p class="depth2">Packed-bed scrubber means a type of control device that includes a  single or double packed bed that contains packing media on which PM and  droplets impinge and are removed from the gas stream. The packed-bed  section of the scrubber is followed by a mist eliminator to remove any  water entrained from the packed-bed section.</p><p class="depth2">Plating and polishing facility means a facility engaged in one or  more of the following processes that uses or emits any of the plating  and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section: electroplating  processes other than chromium electroplating (i.e., non-chromium  electroplating); electroless plating; other non-electrolytic metal  coating processes performed in a tank, such as chromate conversion  coating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and  manganese phosphate coating; thermal spraying; and the dry mechanical  polishing of finished metals and formed products after plating or  thermal spraying. Plating is performed in a tank or thermally sprayed so  that a metal coating is irreversibly applied to an object. Plating and  polishing does not include any bench-scale processes.</p><p class="depth2">Plating and polishing metal HAP means any compound of any of the  following metals: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel, or any  of these metals in the elemental form, with the exception of lead.
