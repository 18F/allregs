                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any individual may request amendment of information pertaining  to him which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Board  and which is filed under his name or other individual identifier if he  believes the information is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete.  A request for amendment shall be directed to the Privacy Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for amendment may be made by mail or in person and  shall: (1) Be in writing and signed by the person making the request;  (2) describe the particular record to be amended with sufficient  specificity to permit the record to be located among those maintained by  the Board; and (3) specify the nature of the amendment sought and the  justification for the requested change. The person making the request  may be required to provide the information specified in Sec. Sec.   1007.3 and 1007.4 in order to simplify identification of the record and  permit verification of the identity of the person making the request for  amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receipt of a request for amendment will be acknowledged in  writing within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public  holidays); except that if the individual is given notice within the ten- day period that his or her request will or will not be complied with, no  acknowledgment is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assistance in preparing a request to amend a record may be  obtained from the Privacy Officer, Surface Transportation Board, 1925 K  Street, NW, Washington, DC 20423.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of a request for amendment the Privacy Officer or a  person designated by him shall promptly determine whether the record is  materially inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or is irrelevant or not  timely, as claimed by the individual, and, if so, shall cause the record  to be amended in accordance with the individual's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the Privacy Officer or designee grants the request to amend  the record, the individual shall promptly be advised of the decision and  of the action taken, and notice shall be given of the correction and its  substance to each person or agency to whom the record had previously  been disclosed, as shown on the record of disclosures maintained in  accordance with Sec.  1007.6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the Privacy Officer or designee disagrees in whole or in part  with a request for amendment of a record, the individual shall promptly  be notified of the complete or partial denial of his request and the  reasons for the refusal. The individual shall also be notified of the  procedures for administrative review by the Chairman of any complete or  partial denial of a request for amendment, which are set forth in Sec.   1007.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a request is received for amendment of a record prepared by  another agency which is in the possession or control of the Board, the  request for amendment will be forwarded to that agency. If that agency  determines that the correction should be made, the Board will amend its  records accordingly and notify the individual making the request for  amendment of the change. If the other agency declines to make the  amendment, the Privacy Officer or designee will independently determine  whether the amendment will be made to the record in the Board's  possession or control, considering any explanation given by the other  agency for its decision.
