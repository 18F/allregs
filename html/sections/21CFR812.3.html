FDA may, in order to protect public health, determine that devices placed in subjects for shorter periods are also ``implants'' for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Institution means a person, other than an individual, who engages in the conduct of research on subjects or in the delivery of medical services to individuals as a primary activity or as an adjunct to providing residential or custodial care to humans. The term includes, for example, a hospital, retirement home, confinement facility, academic establishment, and device manufacturer. The term has the same meaning as ``facility'' in section 520(g) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Institutional review board (IRB) means any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an institution to review biomedical research involving subjects and established, operated, and functioning in conformance with part 56.
