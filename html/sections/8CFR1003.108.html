                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complaints and preliminary inquiries. Except as otherwise  provided by law or regulation, information concerning complaints or  preliminary inquiries is confidential. A practitioner whose conduct is  the subject of a complaint or preliminary inquiry, however, may waive  confidentiality, except that the EOIR disciplinary counsel may decline  to permit a waiver of confidentiality if it is determined that an  ongoing preliminary inquiry may be substantially prejudiced by public  disclosure before the filing of a Notice of Intent to Discipline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of information for the purpose of protecting the  public. The EOIR disciplinary counsel may disclose information  concerning a complaint or preliminary inquiry for the protection of the  public when the necessity for disclosing information outweighs the  necessity for preserving confidentiality in circumstances including, but  not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A practitioner has caused, or is likely to cause, harm to  client(s), the public, or the administration of justice, such that the  public or specific individuals should be advised of the nature of the  allegations. If disclosure of information is made pursuant to this  paragraph, the EOIR disciplinary counsel may define the scope of  information disseminated and may limit the disclosure of information to  specified individuals and entities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A practitioner has committed criminal acts or is under  investigation by law enforcement authorities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A practitioner is under investigation by a disciplinary or  regulatory authority, or has committed acts or made omissions that may  reasonably result in investigation by such authorities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A practitioner is the subject of multiple disciplinary  complaints and the EOIR disciplinary counsel has determined not to  pursue all of the complaints. The EOIR disciplinary counsel may inform  complainants whose allegations have not been pursued of the status of  any other preliminary inquiries or the manner in which any other  complaint(s) against the practitioner have been resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure of information for the purpose of conducting a  preliminary inquiry. The EOIR disciplinary counsel, in the exercise of  discretion, may disclose documents and information concerning complaints  and preliminary inquiries to the following individuals and entities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To witnesses or potential witnesses in conjunction with a  complaint or preliminary inquiry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To other governmental agencies responsible for the enforcement  of civil or criminal laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To agencies and other jurisdictions responsible for  disciplinary or regulatory investigations and proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To the complainant or a lawful designee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> To the practitioner who is the subject of the complaint or  preliminary inquiry or the practitioner's counsel of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Resolutions reached prior to the issuance of a Notice of Intent  to Discipline. Resolutions, such as warning letters, admonitions, and  agreements in lieu of discipline, reached prior to the issuance of a  Notice of Intent to Discipline, will remain confidential. However, such  resolutions may become part of the public record if the practitioner  becomes subject to a subsequent Notice of Intent to Discipline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notices of Intent to Discipline and action subsequent thereto.  Notices of Intent to Discipline and any action that takes place  subsequent to their issuance, except for the imposition of private  censures, may be disclosed to the public, except that private censures  may become part of the public record if introduced as evidence of a  prior record of discipline in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding.  Settlement agreements reached after the issuance of a Notice of Intent  to Discipline may be disclosed to the public upon final approval by the  adjudicating official or the Board. Disciplinary hearings are open to  the public, except as noted in Sec. 1003.106(a)(1)(v).  [65 FR 39526, June 27, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 76926, Dec. 18, 2008]</p>
