                            <p class="depth0">An alternate for a member of the Committee shall act in the place  and stead of such member during his absence or in the event of his  removal, resignation, disqualification, or death, until a successor for  such member's unexpired term has been selected and has qualified. In the  event a member and his alternate are unable to attend a meeting of the  Committee, such member or alternate, in that order, may designate an  alternate from the group he represents to act in his place. If neither a  member nor his alternate has designated an alternate as his replacement,  or such designated alternate is unable to serve as the replacement, the  chairman may, with the concurrence of a majority of the members  including alternates acting as members, representing such group,  designate an alternate from such group who is present at the meeting and  is not acting as a member to act in the place and stead of the absent  member.
