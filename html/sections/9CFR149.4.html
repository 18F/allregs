A certified production site may be subject to a spot audit to trace back and investigate any positive test results as a result of testing of certified swine from that site at the slaughter facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All spot audits will be performed by a QVMO. The producer of the certified production site subject to spot audit will not be charged for the spot audit. APHIS will provide the producer with written notification of the results of the spot audit, including documentation of any deficiencies noted during the audit. If the site is found not to be adhering to one or more of the required good production practices, then the site will be subject to a review by APHIS to consider the nature of the infraction and to determine whether to decertify the site, as provided in Sec. 149.2(e)(1). Unless a spot audit results in decertification, it does not otherwise affect the timetables for the completion of site audits set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 149.3.</p>
