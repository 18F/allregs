                            <p class="depth0">International carriers authorized under Section 214 of the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended, must follow the following  requirements and prohibitions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each carrier is responsible for the continuing accuracy of the  certifications made in its application. Whenever the substance of any  such certification is no longer accurate, the carrier shall as promptly  as possible and, in any event, within thirty (30) days, file with the  Commission a corrected   certification referencing the FCC file number under which the original  certification was provided. The information may be used by the  Commission to determine whether a change in regulatory status may be  warranted under Sec. 63.10. See also Sec. 63.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Carriers must file copies of operating agreements entered into  with their foreign correspondents as specified in Sec. 43.51 of this  chapter and shall otherwise comply with the filing requirements  contained in that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carriers regulated as dominant for the provision of a particular  international communications service on a particular route for any  reason other than a foreign carrier affiliation under Sec. 63.10 shall  file tariffs pursuant to Section 203 of the Communications Act, 47  U.S.C. 203, and part 61 of this chapter. Except as specified in Sec.  20.15(d) of this chapter with respect to commercial mobile radio service  providers, carriers regulated as non-dominant, as defined in Sec. 61.3  of this chapter, and providing detariffed international services  pursuant to Sec. 61.19 of this chapter must comply with all applicable  public disclosure and maintenance of information requirements in  Sec. Sec. 42.10 and 42.11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carriers must file annual international telecommunications  traffic and revenue as required by Sec. 43.62 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authorized carriers may not access or make use of specific U.S.  customer proprietary network information that is derived from a foreign  network unless the carrier obtains approval from that U.S. customer. In  seeking to obtain approval, the carrier must notify the U.S. customer  that the customer may require the carrier to disclose the information to  unaffiliated third parties upon written request by the customer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Authorized carriers may not receive from a foreign carrier any  proprietary or confidential information pertaining to a competing U.S.  carrier, obtained by the foreign carrier in the course of its normal  business dealings, unless the competing U.S. carrier provides its  permission in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commission reserves the right to review a carrier's  authorization, and, if warranted, impose additional requirements on U.S.  international carriers in circumstances where it appears that harm to  competition is occurring on one or more U.S. international routes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subject to the requirement of Sec. 63.10 that a carrier  regulated as dominant along a route must provide service as an entity  that is separate from its foreign carrier affiliate, and subject to any  other structural-separation requirement in Commission regulations, an  authorized carrier may provide service through any wholly owned direct  or indirect subsidiaries. The carrier must, within thirty (30) days  after the subsidiary begins providing service, file with the Commission  a notification referencing the authorized carrier's name and the FCC  file numbers under which the carrier's authorizations were granted and  identifying the subsidiary's name and place of legal organization. This  provision shall not be construed to authorize the provision of service  by any entity barred by statute or regulation from itself holding an  authorization or providing service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> An authorized carrier, or a subsidiary operating pursuant to  paragraph (h) of this section, that changes its name (including the name  under which it is doing business) must notify the Commission within  thirty (30) days of the name change. Such notification shall reference  the FCC file numbers under which the carrier's authorizations were  granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Subject to the availability of electronic forms, all  notifications and other filings described in this section must be filed  electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS). A  list of forms that are available for electronic filing can be found on  the IBFS homepage. For information on electronic filing requirements,  see part 1, Sec. Sec. 1.1000 through 1.10018 of this chapter and the  IBFS homepage at http://www.fcc.gov/ibfs. See also Sec. Sec. 63.20 and  63.53.
