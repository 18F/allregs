Appendix A to Part 62--Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal</p><p class="depth0">Insurance Administration, Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement</p><p class="depth0">Purpose: To assist the company in underwriting flood insurance using  the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth0">Accounting Data: Pursuant to Section 1310 of the Act, a Letter of  Credit shall be issued for payment as provided for herein from the  National Flood Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date: October 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0">Issued By: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance  Administration, Washington, DC 20472.</p><p class="depth0">Article I--Findings, Purpose, and Authority</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, the Congress in its ``Finding and Declaration of Purpose''  in the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, (``the Act'' or  ``Act'') recognized the benefit of having the National Flood Insurance  Program (the ``Program'' or ``NFIP'') ``carried out to the maximum  extent practicable by the private insurance industry''; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) within the  Mitigation Division recognizes this Arrangement as coming under the  provisions of Section 1345 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 4081); and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, the goal of the FIA is to develop a program with the  insurance industry where, over time, some risk-bearing role for the  industry will evolve as intended by the Congress (Section 1304 of the  Act (42 U.S.C. 4011)); and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, the insurer (hereinafter the ``Company'') under this  Arrangement shall charge rates established by the FIA; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, FIA has promulgated regulations and guidance implementing  the Act and the Write-Your-Own Program whereby participating private  insurance companies act in a fiduciary capacity utilizing Federal funds  to sell and administer the Standard Flood Insurance Policies, and has  extensively regulated the participating companies' activities when  selling or administering the Standard Flood Insurance Policies; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, any litigation resulting from, related to, or arising from  the Company's compliance with the written standards, procedures, and  guidance issued by FEMA or FIA arises under the Act, regulations, or FIA  guidance, and legal issues thereunder raise a federal question; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, through this Arrangement, the Federal Treasury will back  all flood policy claim payments by the Company; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, this Arrangement has been developed to enable any  interested qualified insurer to write flood insurance under its own  name; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, one of the primary objectives of the Program is to provide  coverage to the maximum number of structures at risk and because the  insurance industry has marketing access through its existing facilities  not directly available to the FIA, it has been concluded that coverage  will be extended to those who would not otherwise be insured under the  Program; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, flood insurance policies issued subject to this Arrangement  shall be only that insurance written by the Company in its own name  under prescribed policy conditions and pursuant to this Arrangement and  the Act; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, over time, the Program is designed to increase industry  participation, and accordingly, reduce or eliminate Government as the  principal vehicle for delivering flood insurance to the public; and</p><p class="depth0">Whereas, the sole parties under this Arrangement are the WYO  Companies and the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0">Now, therefore, the parties hereto mutually undertake the following:</p><p class="depth0">Article II--Undertaking of the Company</p><p class="depth0">A. Eligibility Requirements for Participation in the NFIP:</p><p class="depth0">1. Policy Administration. All fund receipt, recording, control,  timely deposit requirements, and disbursement in connection with all  Policy Administration and any other related activities or  correspondences, must meet all requirements of the Financial Control  Plan. The Company shall be responsible for:</p><p class="depth0">a. Compliance with the Community Eligibility/Rating Criteria</p><p class="depth0">b. Making Policyholder Eligibility Determinations</p><p class="depth0">c. Policy Issuance</p><p class="depth0">d. Policy Endorsements</p><p class="depth0">e. Policy Cancellations</p><p class="depth0">f. Policy Correspondence</p><p class="depth0">g. Payment of Agents' Commissions</p><p class="depth0">2. Claims Processing. All claims processing must be processed in  accordance with the processing of all the companies' insurance policies  and with the Financial Control Plan. Companies will also be required to  comply with FIA Policy Issuances and other guidance authorized by FIA or  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA'').</p><p class="depth0">3. Reports.</p><p class="depth0">a. Monthly Financial Reporting and Statistical Transaction reporting  requirements. All monthly financial reporting and statistical  transaction reporting shall be in accordance with the requirements of  the NFIP Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan for the  Company Program and the Financial Control Plan for business written  under the WYO (Write Your Own) Program. 44 CFR part 62, appendix B.  These data shall be validated/edited/audited in detail and shall be  compared and balanced against Company reports.</p><p class="depth0">b. Monthly financial reporting procedure shall be in accordance with  the WYO Accounting Procedures.</p><p class="depth0">B. Time Standards. Time will be measured from the date of receipt  through the date mailed out. All dates referenced are working days, not  calendar days. In addition to the standards set forth below, all  functions performed by the company shall be in accordance with the  highest reasonably attainable quality standards generally utilized in  the insurance and data processing field. Continual failure to meet these  requirements may result in limitations on the company's authority to  write new business or the removal of the Company from the program.  Applicable time standards are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Application Processing--15 days (note: if the policy cannot be  mailed due to insufficient or erroneous information or insufficient  funds, a request for correction or added moneys shall be mailed within  10 days);</p><p class="depth0">2. Renewal Processing--7 days.</p><p class="depth0">3. Endorsement Processing--15 days.</p><p class="depth0">4. Cancellation Processing--15 days.</p><p class="depth0">5. Claims Draft Processing--7 days from completion of file  examination.</p><p class="depth0">6. Claims Adjustment--45 days average from the receipt of Notice of  Loss (or equivalent) through completion of examination.</p><p class="depth0">C. Single Adjuster Program. To ensure the maximum responsiveness to  the NFIP policy holders following a catastrophic event, e.g., a  hurricane, involving insured wind and flood damage to policyholders, the  Company shall agree to the adjustment of the combined flood and wind  losses utilizing one adjuster under an NFIP-approved Single Adjuster  Program using procedures issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator.  The Single Adjuster procedure shall be followed in the following cases:</p><p class="depth0">1. Where the flood and wind coverage is provided by the Company;</p><p class="depth0">2. Where the flood coverage is provided by the Company and the wind  coverage is provided by a participating State Property Insurance Plan,  Windpool Association, Beach Plan, Joint Underwriting Association, FAIR  Plan, or similar property insurance mechanism; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Where the flood coverage is provided by the Company and the wind  coverage is provided by another property insurer and the State Insurance  Regulator has determined that such property insurer shall, in the  interest of consumers, facilitate the adjustment of its wind loss by the  adjuster engaged to adjust the flood loss of the Company.</p><p class="depth0">D. Policy Issuance.</p><p class="depth0">1. The flood insurance subject to this Arrangement shall be only  that insurance written by the Company in its own name pursuant to the  Act.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Company shall issue policies under the regulations prescribed  by the Federal Insurance Administrator in accordance with the Act.</p><p class="depth0">3. All such policies of insurance shall conform to the regulations  prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administrator pursuant to the Act,  and be issued on a form approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">4. All policies shall be issued in consideration of such premiums  and upon such terms and conditions and in such States or areas or  subdivisions thereof as may be designated by the Federal Insurance  Administrator and only where the Company is licensed by State   law to engage in the property insurance business.</p><p class="depth0">5. The Federal Insurance Administrator may require the Company to  discontinue issuing policies subject to this Arrangement immediately in  the event Congressional authorization or appropriation for the National  Flood Insurance Program is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">E. The Company shall separate Federal flood insurance funds from all  other Company accounts, at a bank or banks of its choosing for the  collection, retention and disbursement of Federal funds relating to its  obligation under this Arrangement, less the Company's expenses as set  forth in Article III, and the operation of the Letter of Credit  established pursuant to Article IV. All funds not required to meet  current expenditures shall be remitted to the United States Treasury, in  accordance with the provisions of the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual.</p><p class="depth0">F. The Company shall investigate, adjust, settle and defend all  claims or losses arising from policies issued under this Arrangement.  Payment of flood insurance claims by the Company shall be binding upon  the FIA.</p><p class="depth0">G. Compliance with Agency Standard and Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">1. The Company shall comply with written standards, procedures, and  guidance issued by FEMA or FIA relating to the NFIP and applicable to  the Company.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Company shall market flood insurance policies in a manner  consistent with marketing guidelines established by FIA.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Company shall notify its agents of the requirement to comply  with State regulations regarding flood insurance agent education, notify  agents of flood insurance training opportunities, and assist FEMA in  periodic assessment of agent training needs.</p><p class="depth0">Article III--Loss Costs, Expenses, Expense Reimbursement, and Premium</p><p class="depth0">Refunds</p><p class="depth0">A. The Company shall be liable for operating, administrative and  production expenses, including any State premium taxes, dividends,  agents' commissions or any other expense of whatever nature incurred by  the Company in the performance of its obligations under this Arrangement  but excluding other taxes or fees, such as surcharges on flood insurance  premium and guaranty fund assessments.</p><p class="depth0">B. The Company may withhold as operating and administrative  expenses, other than agents' or brokers' commissions, an amount from the  Company's written premium on the policies covered by this Arrangement in  reimbursement of all of the Company's marketing, operating, and  administrative expenses, except for allocated and unallocated loss  adjustment expenses described in C. of this article. This amount will  equal the sum of the average of industry expense ratios for ``Other  Acq.'', ``Gen. Exp.'', and ``Taxes'' calculated by aggregating premiums  and expense amounts for each of five property coverages using direct  premium and expense information to derive weighted average expense  ratios. For this purpose, we (the Federal Insurance Administration) will  use data for the property/casualty industry published, as of March 15 of  the prior Arrangement year, in Part III of the Insurance Expense Exhibit  in A.M. Best Company's Aggregates and Averages for the following five  property coverages: Fire, Allied Lines, Farmowners Multiple Peril,  Homeowners Multiple Peril, and Commercial Multiple Peril (non-liability  portion). In addition, this amount will be increased by one percentage  point to reimburse expenses beyond regular property/casualty expenses.</p><p class="depth0">The Company may retain fifteen percent (15%) of the Company's  written premium on the policies covered by this Arrangement as the  commission allowance to meet commissions or salaries of insurance  agents, brokers, or other entities producing qualified flood insurance  applications and other related expenses.</p><p class="depth0">The amount of expense allowance retained by the Company may increase  a maximum of two percentage points, depending on the extent to which the  Company meets the marketing goals for the Arrangement year contained in  marketing guidelines established pursuant to Article II.G. We will pay  the company the amount of any increase after the end of the Arrangement  year.</p><p class="depth0">The Company, with the consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator  as to terms and costs, may use the services of a national rating  organization, licensed under state law, to help us undertake and carry  out such studies and investigations on a community or individual risk  basis, and to determine equitable and accurate estimates of flood  insurance risk premium rates as authorized under the National Flood  Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. We will reimburse the Company for the  charges or fees for such services under the provisions of the WYO  Accounting Procedures Manual.</p><p class="depth0">C. Loss Adjustment Expenses shall be reimbursed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Unallocated loss adjustment expense shall be reimbursed to the  Company pursuant to a ``ULAE Schedule'' coordinated with the Company and  provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocated loss adjustment expense shall be reimbursed to the  Company pursuant to a ``Fee Schedule'' coordinated with the Company and  provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">3. Special allocated loss expenses shall be reimbursed to the  Company in accordance with guidelines issued by the Federal Insurance  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">D. Loss Payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loss payments under policies of flood insurance shall be made by  the Company from Federal funds retained in the bank account(s)  established under Article II, Section E and, if such funds are depleted,  from Federal funds derived by drawing against the Letter of Credit  established pursuant to Article IV.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loss payments include payments as a result of litigation that  arises under the scope of this Arrangement, and the Authorities set  forth herein. All such loss payments and related expenses must meet the  documentation requirements of the Financial Control Plan and of this  Arrangement, and the Company must comply with the litigation  documentation and notification requirements established by FEMA. Failure  to meet these requirements may result in the Federal Insurance  Administrator's decision not to provide reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Limitation on Litigation Costs.</p><p class="depth0">a. Following receipt of notice of such litigation, the FEMA Office  of the Chief Counsel (``OCC'') shall review the information submitted.  If the FEMA OGC finds that the litigation is grounded in actions by the  Company that are significantly outside the scope of this Arrangement,  and/or involves issues of agent negligence, then the FEMA OCC shall make  a recommendation to the Federal Insurance Administrator regarding  whether all or part of the litigation is significantly outside the scope  of the Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the event the Federal Insurance Administrator agrees with the  determination of the FEMA OCC under Article III, Section D.3.a then the  Company will be notified in writing within thirty (30) days of the  Federal Insurance Administrator's decision that any award or judgment  for damages and any costs to defend such litigation will not be  recognized under Article III as a reimbursable loss cost, expense or  expense reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0">c. In the event a question arises whether only part of a litigation  is reimbursable, the FEMA OCC shall make a recommendation to the Federal  Insurance Administrator about the appropriate division of  responsibility, if possible.</p><p class="depth0">d. In the event that the Company wishes to petition for  reconsideration of the determination that it will not be reimbursed for  any part of the award or judgment or any part of the costs expended to  defend such litigation made under Article III, Section D.3.a-c, it may  do so by mailing, within thirty (30) days of the notice that  reimbursement will not be made, a written petition to the Federal  Insurance Administrator, who may request advice on other than legal  matters of the WYO Standards Committee established under the WYO  Financial Control Plan. The WYO Standards Committee will consider the  request at its next regularly scheduled meeting or at a special meeting  called for that purpose by the Chairman and issue a written  recommendation to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The Federal  Insurance Administrator's final determination will be made in writing  within a reasonable time to the Company.</p><p class="depth0">E. Premium refunds to applicants and policyholders required pursuant  to rules contained in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)  ``Flood Insurance Manual'' shall be made by the Company from Federal  flood insurance funds referred to in Article II, Section E, and, if such  funds are depleted, from funds derived by drawing against the Letter of  Credit established pursuant to Article IV. As fiscal agent, the Company  shall not refund any premium to applicants or policyholders in any  manner other than as specified in the NFIP's ``Flood Insurance Manual''  since flood insurance premiums are funds of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV--Undertakings of the Government</p><p class="depth0">A. Letter(s) of Credit shall be established by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) against which the Company may withdraw funds  daily, if needed, pursuant to prescribed procedures implemented by FEMA.  The amounts of the authorizations will be increased as necessary to meet  the obligations of the Company under Article III, Sections C, D, and E.  Request for funds shall be made only when net premium income has been  depleted. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is  administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient  organization for allowable Letter of Credit expenses.</p><p class="depth0">Request for payment on Letters of Credit shall not ordinarily be  drawn more frequently than daily nor in amounts less than $5,000, and in  no case more than $5,000,000 unless so stated on the Letter of Credit.  This Letter of Credit may be drawn by the Company for any of the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment of claim as described in Article III, Section D;</p><p class="depth0">2. Refunds to applicants and policyholders for insurance premium  overpayment, or if the application for insurance is rejected or when  cancellation or endorsement of a policy results in a premium refund as  described in Article III, Section E; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Allocated and unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses as described  in Article III, Section C.</p><p class="depth0">B. The FIA shall provide technical assistance to the Company as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. The FIA's policy and history concerning underwriting and claims  handling.</p><p class="depth0">2. A mechanism to assist in clarification of coverage and claims  questions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other assistance as needed.</p><p class="depth0">Article V--Commencement and Termination</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial period of this Arrangement is from October 1, 2004  through September 30, 2005. Thereafter the Arrangement will be effective  on an annual basis for the period October 1 through September 30. The  FIA shall provide financial assistance only for policy applications and  endorsements accepted by the Company during this period pursuant to the  Program's effective date, underwriting and eligibility rules.</p><p class="depth0">B. Each year, the FIA shall publish in the Federal Register and make  available to the Company the terms for subscription or re-subscription  to this Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement. The Company shall  notify the FIA of its intent to re-subscribe or not re-subscribe within  thirty days of publication.</p><p class="depth0">C. In order to assure uninterrupted service to policyholders, the  Company shall promptly notify the FIA in the event the Company elects  not to participate in the Program during the Arrangement year. If so  notified, or if the FIA chooses not to renew the Company's  participation, the FIA, at its option, may require the continued  performance of all or selected elements of this Arrangement for the  period required for orderly transfer or cessation of business and  settlement of accounts, not to exceed 18 months, and may either require  Article V.C.1 or allow Article V.C.2:</p><p class="depth0">1. The delivery to the FIA of:</p><p class="depth0">a. A plan for the orderly transfer to the FIA of any continuing  responsibilities in administering the policies issued by the Company  under the Program including provisions for coordination assistance; and</p><p class="depth0">b. All data received, produced, and maintained through the life of  the Company's participation in the Program, including certain data, as  determined by FIA, in a standard format and medium; and</p><p class="depth0">c. All claims and policy files, including those pertaining to  receipts and disbursements that have occurred during the life of each  policy. In the event of a transfer of the services provided, the Company  shall provide the FIA with a report showing, on a policy basis, any  amounts due from or payable to insureds, agents, brokers, and others as  of the transition date; and</p><p class="depth0">d. All funds in its possession with respect to any policies  transferred to FIA for administration and the unearned expenses retained  by the Company.</p><p class="depth0">2. Submission of plans for the renewal of the business by another  WYO Company or Companies or the submission of detailed plans for another  WYO Company to assume responsibility for the Company's NFIP policies.  Such plans shall assure uninterrupted service to policyholders and shall  be accompanied by a formal request for FIA approval of such transfers.</p><p class="depth0">D. Financial assistance under this Arrangement may be canceled by  the FIA in its entirety upon thirty (30) days written notice to the  Company by certified mail stating one of the following reasons for such  cancellation: (i) Fraud or misrepresentation by the Company subsequent  to the inception of the Arrangement; or (ii) Nonpayment to the FIA of  any amount due the FIA; or (iii) Material failure to comply with the  requirements of this Arrangement or with the written standards,  procedures, or guidance issued by FEMA or FIA relating to the NFIP and  applicable to the Company. Under these specific conditions, the FIA may  require the transfer of administrative responsibilities and the transfer  of data and records as provided in Article V, Section C.1.a through d.  If transfer is required, the unearned expenses retained by the Company  shall be remitted to the FIA. In such event, the Government will assume  all obligations and liabilities owed to policyholders under such  policies, arising before and after the date of transfer. As an  alternative to transfer of the policies to the Government, the FIA will  consider a proposal, if it is made by the Company, for the assumption of  responsibilities by another WYO Company as provided in Article V,  Section C.2.</p><p class="depth0">E. In the event that the Company is unable or otherwise fails to  carry out its obligations under this Arrangement by reason of any order  or directive duly issued by the Department of Insurance of any  jurisdiction to which the Company is subject, the Company agrees to  transfer, and the Government will accept, any and all WYO policies  issued by the Company and in force as of the date of such inability or  failure to perform. In such event the Government will assume all  obligations and liabilities within the scope of the Arrangement owed to  policyholders arising before and after the date of transfer, and the  Company will immediately transfer to the Government all needed records  and data and all funds in its possession with respect to all such  policies transferred and the unearned expenses retained by the Company.  As an alternative to transfer of the policies to the Government, the FIA  will consider a proposal, if it is made by the Company, for the  assumption of responsibilities by another WYO Company as provided by  Article V, Section C.2.</p><p class="depth0">F. In the event the Act is amended, or repealed, or expires, or if  the FIA is otherwise without authority to continue the Program,  financial assistance under this Arrangement may be canceled for any new  or renewal business, but the Arrangement shall continue for policies in  force that shall be allowed to run their term under the Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Article VI--Information and Annual Statements</p><p class="depth0">The Company shall furnish to FEMA such summaries and analyses of  information including claim file information, and property address,  location, and/or site information in its records as may be necessary to  carry out the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as  amended, in such form as the FIA, in cooperation with the Company, shall  prescribe. The Company shall be a property/casualty insurer domiciled in  a State or territory of the United States. Upon request, the Company  shall file with the FIA a true and correct copy of the Company's Fire  and Casualty Annual Statement, and Insurance Expense Exhibit or  amendments thereof as filed with the State Insurance Authority of the  Company's domiciliary State.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII--Cash Management and Accounting</p><p class="depth0">A. FEMA shall make available to the Company during the entire term  of this Arrangement and any continuation period required by FIA pursuant  to Article V, Section C., the Letter of Credit provided for in Article  IV drawn on a repository bank within the Federal Reserve System upon  which the Company may draw for reimbursement of its expenses as set  forth in Article IV that exceed net written premiums collected by the  Company from the effective date of this Arrangement or continuation  period to the date of the draw. In the event that adequate Letter of  Credit funding is not available to meet current Company obligations for  flood policy claim payments issued, FIA shall direct the Company to  immediately suspend the issuance of loss payments until such time as  adequate funds are available. The Companies are not required to pay  claims from their own funds in the event of such suspension.</p><p class="depth0">B. The Company shall remit all funds, including interest, not  required to meet current expenditures to the United States Treasury, in  accordance with the provisions of the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual  or procedures approved in writing by the FIA.</p><p class="depth0">C. In the event the Company elects not to participate in the Program  in this or any subsequent fiscal year, or is otherwise unable or not  permitted to participate, the Company and FIA shall make a provisional  settlement of all amounts due or owing within three months of the  expiration or termination of this Arrangement. This settlement shall  include net premiums collected, funds drawn on the Letter of Credit, and  reserves for outstanding claims. The Company and FIA agree to make a  final settlement, subject to audit, of accounts for all obligations  arising from this Arrangement within 18 months of its expiration or  termination, except for contingent liabilities that shall be listed by  the Company. At the time of final settlement, the balance, if any, due  the FIA or the Company shall be remitted by the other immediately and  the operating year under this Arrangement shall be closed.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII--Arbitration</p><p class="depth0">If any misunderstanding or dispute arises between the Company and  the FIA with reference to any factual issue under any provisions of this  Arrangement or with respect to the FIA's non-renewal of the Company's  participation, other than as to legal liability under or interpretation  of the standard flood insurance policy, such misunderstanding or dispute  may be submitted to arbitration for a determination that shall be  binding upon approval by the FIA. The Company and the FIA may agree on  and appoint an arbitrator who shall investigate the subject of the  misunderstanding or dispute and make a determination. If the Company and  the FIA cannot agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, then two  arbitrators shall be appointed, one to be chosen by the Company and one  by the FIA.</p><p class="depth0">The two arbitrators so chosen, if they are unable to reach an  agreement, shall select a third arbitrator who shall act as umpire, and  such umpire's determination shall become final only upon approval by the  FIA.</p><p class="depth0">The Company and the FIA shall bear in equal shares all expenses of  the arbitration. Findings, proposed awards, and determinations resulting  from arbitration proceedings carried out under this section, upon  objection by FIA or the Company, shall be inadmissible as evidence in  any subsequent proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">This Article shall indefinitely succeed the term of this  Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX--Errors and Omissions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> if the claim against the  Company is grounded in actions significantly outside the scope of this  Arrangement or (ii) if there is negligence by the agent, FEMA will not  reimburse any costs incurred due to that negligence. The Company will be  notified in writing within thirty (30) days of a decision not to  reimburse. In the event the Company wishes to petition for  reconsideration of the decision not to reimburse, the procedure in  Article III, Section D.3.d shall apply.</p><p class="depth0">However, in the event that the Company has made a claim payment to  an insured   without including a mortgagee (or trustee) of which the Company had  actual notice prior to making payment, and subsequently determines that  the mortgagee (or trustee) is also entitled to any part of said claim  payment, any additional payment shall not be paid by the Company from  any portion of the premium and any funds derived from any Federal Letter  of Credit deposited in the bank account described in Article II, section  E. In addition, the Company agrees to hold the Federal Government  harmless against any claim asserted against the Federal Government by  any such mortgagee (or Trustee), as described in the preceding sentence,  by reason of any claim payment made to any insured under the  circumstances described above.</p><p class="depth0">Article X--Officials Not to Benefit</p><p class="depth0">No Member or Delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall  be admitted to any share or part of this Arrangement, or to any benefit  that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to  extend to this Arrangement if made with a corporation for its general  benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Article XI--Offset</p><p class="depth0">At the settlement of accounts the Company and the FIA shall have,  and may exercise, the right to offset any balance or balances, whether  on account of premiums, commissions, losses, loss adjustment expenses,  salvage, or otherwise due one party to the other, its successors or  assigns, hereunder or under any other Arrangements heretofore or  hereafter entered into between the Company and the FIA. This right of  offset shall not be affected or diminished because of insolvency of the  Company.</p><p class="depth0">All debts or credits of the same class, whether liquidated or  unliquidated, in favor of or against either party to this Arrangement on  the date of entry, or any order of conservation, receivership, or  liquidation, shall be deemed to be mutual debts and credits and shall be  offset with the balance only to be allowed or paid. No offset shall be  allowed where a conservator, receiver, or liquidator has been appointed  and where an obligation was purchased by or transferred to a party  hereunder to be used as an offset.</p><p class="depth0">Although a claim on the part of either party against the other may  be unliquidated or undetermined in amount on the date of the entry of  the order, such claim will be regarded as being in existence as of the  date of such order and any credits or claims of the same class then in  existence and held by the other party may be offset against it.</p><p class="depth0">Article XII--Equal Opportunity</p><p class="depth0">The Company shall not discriminate against any applicant for  insurance because of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, marital  status, or national origin.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIII--Restriction on Other Flood Insurance</p><p class="depth0">As a condition of entering into this Arrangement, the Company agrees  that in any area in which the Federal Insurance Administrator authorizes  the purchase of flood insurance pursuant to the Program, all flood  insurance offered and sold by the Company to persons eligible to buy  pursuant to the Program for coverages available under the Program shall  be written pursuant to this Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">However, this restriction applies solely to policies providing only  flood insurance. It does not apply to policies provided by the Company  of which flood is one of the several perils covered, or where the flood  insurance coverage amount is over and above the limits of liability  available to the insured under the Program.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIV--Access to Books and Records</p><p class="depth0">The FIA and the Comptroller General of The United States, or their  duly authorized representatives, for the purpose of investigation,  audit, and examination shall have access to any books, documents, papers  and records of the Company that are pertinent to this Arrangement. The  Company shall keep records that fully disclose all matters pertinent to  this Arrangement, including premiums and claims paid or payable under  policies issued pursuant to this Arrangement. Records of accounts and  records relating to financial assistance shall be retained and available  for three (3) years after final settlement of accounts, and to financial  assistance, three (3) years after final adjustment of such claims. The  FIA shall have access to policyholder and claim records at all times for  purposes of the review, defense, examination, adjustment, or  investigation of any claim under a flood insurance policy subject to  this Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Article XV--Compliance With Act and Regulations</p><p class="depth0">This Arrangement and all policies of insurance issued pursuant  thereto shall be subject to the provisions of the National Flood  Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of  1973, as amended, the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, and  Regulations issued pursuant thereto and all Regulations affecting the  work that are issued pursuant thereto, during the term hereof.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVI--Relationship Between the Parties (Federal Government and</p><p class="depth0">Company) and the Insured</p><p class="depth0">Inasmuch as the Federal Government is a guarantor hereunder, the  primary relationship between the Company and the Federal Government is  one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are  accounted for and appropriately expended. The Company is a fiscal agent  of the Federal Government, but is not a general agent of the Federal  Government. The Company is solely responsible for its obligations to its  insured under any policy issued pursuant hereto, such that the Federal  Government is not a proper party to any lawsuit arising out of such  policies.

Appendix B to Part 62--National Flood Insurance Program</p><p class="depth0">A Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the</p><p class="depth0">Write Your Own Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under the Write Your Own (WYO) Program, we (the  Federal Insurance Administration (FIA), Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA)) may enter into an arrangement with individual private  sector insurance companies licensed to engage in the business of  property insurance. The arrangement allows these companies--using their  customary business practices--to offer flood insurance coverage to  eligible property owners. To assist companies in marketing flood  insurance coverage, the Federal Government will be a guarantor of flood  insurance coverage for WYO policies issued under the WYO Arrangement. To  account for and ensure appropriate spending of any taxpayer funds, the  WYO companies and we will implement this Financial Control Plan (Plan).  Only the Federal Insurance Administrator may approve any departures from  the requirements of this Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Financial Control Plan. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The WYO Companies are subject to  audit, examination, and regulatory controls of the various States.  Additionally, the operating department of an insurance company is  customarily subject to examinations and audits performed by the  company's internal audit or quality control departments, or both, and  independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firms. This Plan will use  to the extent possible the findings of these examinations and audits as  they pertain to business written under the WYO Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This Plan contains several checks and balances that can, if  properly implemented by the WYO Company, significantly reduce the need  for extensive on-site reviews of the Company's files by us or our  designee. Furthermore, we believe that this process is consistent with  customary reinsurance practices and avoids duplication of examinations  performed under the auspices of individual State Insurance Departments,  NAIC Zone examinations, and independent CPA firms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Standards Committee established. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We establish in this Plan a  Standards Committee for the WYO Program to oversee the performance of  WYO companies under this Plan and to recommend appropriate remedial  actions to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The Standards Committee  will review and recommend to the Federal Insurance Administrator  remedies for any adverse action arising from the implementation of the  Financial Control Plan. Adverse actions include, but are not limited to,  not renewing a particular company's WYO Arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Federal Insurance Administrator appoints the members of the  Standards Committee, which consists of five (5) members from FIA, one  (1) member from FEMA's Office of Chief Financial Officer, and one (1)  member from each of the six (6) designated WYO Companies, pools, or  other entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A WYO company must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial  statements conducted by a CPA firm at the Company's expense to ensure  that the financial data reported to us accurately represents the flood  insurance activities of the Company. The CPA firm must conduct its  audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS)  and the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General  of the United States (commonly known as ``yellow book'' requirements).  The Company must file with us a report of the CPA firm's detailed  biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit report, we will  convey our determination to the Standards Committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will  conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims,  underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at  least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will  reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the  Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan (Part  5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the Standards  Committee (Part 7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO  Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRRP) Plan and the WYO  Accounting Procedures Manual. The National Flood Insurance Program's  (NFIP) Bureau and Statistical Agent will analyze the transactions  reported under the TRRP Plan and submit a monthly report to the WYO  company and to us. The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO  submissions, the disposition of transactions that do not pass systems  edits, and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction  reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's reports.
