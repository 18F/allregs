                            <p class="depth0">The nomenclature employed in this portion of the rating schedule is based upon the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (see Sec.  4.125 for availability information). Rating agencies must be thoroughly familiar with this manual to properly implement the directives in Sec.  4.125 through Sec.  4.129 and to apply the general rating formula for mental disorders in Sec.  4.130. The schedule for rating for mental disorders is set forth as follows:
