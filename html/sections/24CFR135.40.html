                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. In accordance with the findings of the Congress, as  stated in section 3, that other economic opportunities offer an  effective means of empowering low-income persons, a recipient is  encouraged to undertake efforts to provide to low-income persons  economic opportunities other than training, employment, and contract  awards, in connection with section 3 covered assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other training and employment related opportunities. Other  economic opportunities to train and employ section 3 residents include,  but need not be limited to, use of ``upward mobility'', ``bridge'' and  trainee positions to fill vacancies; hiring section 3 residents in   management and maintenance positions within other housing developments;  and hiring section 3 residents in part-time positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other business related economic opportunities. (l) A recipient  or contractor may provide economic opportunities to establish, stabilize  or expand section 3 business concerns, including micro-enterprises. Such  opportunities include, but are not limited to the formation of section 3  joint ventures, financial support for affiliating with franchise  development, use of labor only contracts for building trades, purchase  of supplies and materials from housing authority resident-owned  businesses, purchase of materials and supplies from PHA resident-owned  businesses and use of procedures under 24 CFR part 963 regarding HA  contracts to HA resident-owned businesses. A recipient or contractor may  employ these methods directly or may provide incentives to non-section 3  businesses to utilize such methods to provide other economic  opportunities to low-income persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A section 3 joint venture means an association of business  concerns, one of which qualifies as a section 3 business concern, formed  by written joint venture agreement to engage in and carry out a specific  business venture for which purpose the business concerns combine their  efforts, resources, and skills for joint profit, but not necessarily on  a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally, and  for which the section 3 business concern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work to be  performed and holds management responsibilities in the joint venture;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Performs at least 25 percent of the work and is contractually  entitled to compensation proportionate to its work.
