                                Sec. 10.313  Will OWCP pay for preventive treatment?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The FECA does not authorize payment for preventive measures such as vaccines and inoculations, and in general, preventive treatment may be a responsibility of the employing agency under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7901 (see Sec. 10.303). However, OWCP can authorize treatment for the following conditions, even though such treatment is designed, in part, to prevent further injury:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complications of preventive measures which are provided or sponsored by the agency, such as an adverse reaction to prophylactic immunization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actual or probable exposure to a known contaminant due to an injury, thereby requiring disease-specific measures against infection. Examples include the provision of tetanus antitoxin or booster toxoid injections for puncture wounds; administration of rabies vaccine for a bite from a rabid or potentially rabid animal; or appropriate measures where exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conversion of tuberculin reaction from negative to positive following exposure to tuberculosis in the performance of duty. In this situation, the appropriate therapy may be authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where injury to one eye has resulted in loss of vision, periodic examination of the uninjured eye to detect possible sympathetic involvement of the uninjured eye at an early stage.</p>
