                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taxes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> United States taxes. In computing accumulated taxable  income for any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a deduction the  amount by which Federal income and excess profits taxes accrued during  the taxable year exceed the credit provided by section 33 (relating to  taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States), except  that no deduction shall be allowed for (i) the accumulated earnings tax  imposed by section 531 (or a corresponding section of a prior law), (ii)  the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or a  corresponding section of a prior law), and (iii) the excess profits tax  imposed by subchapter E, chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,  for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1940. The deduction is  for taxes accrued during the taxable year, regardless of whether the  corporation uses an accrual method of accounting, the cash receipts and  disbursements method, or any other allowable method of accounting. In  computing the amount of taxes accrued, an unpaid tax which is being  contested is not considered accrued until the contest is resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxes of foreign countries and United States possessions. In  determining accumulated taxable income for any taxable year, if the  taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901 for such taxable year, a  deduction shall be allowed for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by  foreign countries or possessions of the United States and accrued during  such taxable year, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph  exceed the amount includible in gross income with respect to such taxes  under section 78 and Sec. 1.78-1. The credit for such taxes provided by  section 901 shall not be allowed against the accumulated earnings tax  imposed by section 531. See section 901(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> shall be allowed as a  deduction in computing accumulated taxable income for the taxable year.  However, any excess of the amount of the charitable contributions made  in a prior taxable year over the amount allowed as a deduction under  section 170 for such year shall not be allowed as a deduction from  taxable income in computing accumulated taxable income for the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special deductions disallowed. Sections 241 through 248 provide  for the allowance of special deductions for such items as partially tax- exempt interest, certain dividends received, dividends paid on certain  preferred stock of public utilities, and organizational expenses. Such  special deductions, except the deduction provided by section 248  (relating to organizational expenses) shall be disallowed in computing  accumulated taxable income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Net operating loss. The net operating loss deduction provided in  section 172 is not allowed for purposes of computing accumulated taxable  income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Capital losses. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Losses from sales or exchanges of capital  assets during the taxable year, which are disallowed as deductions under  section 1211(a) in computing taxable income, shall be allowed as  deductions in computing accumulated taxable income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The computation of the capital losses allowable as a deduction  in computing accumulated taxable income may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. X Corporation has capital losses of $30,000 which are  disallowed under section 1211(a) for the taxable year ended December 31,  1956. This amount represents a loss of $25,000 from the sale or exchange  of capital assets during the taxable year ended December 31, 1956, plus  a $5,000 capital loss carryover resulting from the sale or exchange of  capital assets during the taxable year ended December 31, 1955. In  computing accumulated taxable income for the taxable year ended December  31, 1956, only the loss of $25,000 arising from the sale or exchange of  capital assets during that taxable year will be allowed as a deduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Long-term capital gains. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is allowed as a deduction in  computing accumulated taxable income, the excess of the net long-term  capital gain for the taxable year over the net short-term capital loss  for such year (determined without regard to the capital loss carryover  provided in section 1212) minus the taxes attributable to such excess as  provided by section 535(b)(6). The tax attributable to such excess is  the difference between:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxes (except the accumulated earnings tax) imposed by  subtitle A of the Code for such year, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxes (except the accumulated earnings tax) imposed by  subtitle A computed for such year as if taxable income were reduced by  the excess of the net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital  loss (including the capital loss carryover to such year)   Where the tax (except the accumulated earnings tax) imposed by subtitle  A includes an amount computed under section 1201(a)(2), the tax  attributable to such excess is such amount computed under section  1201(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of the rule in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. Assume that D Corporation, for the taxable year ended  December 31, 1956, has taxable income of $103,000 of which $8,000 is the  excess of net long-term capital gain of $12,000 over a net short-term  capital loss of $9,000. The $9,000 net short-term capital loss includes  a capital loss carryover of $5,000. The amount allowable as a deduction  under section 535(b)(6) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is  $7,250, computed as follows: Net long-term capital gain less net short- term capital loss (computed without regard to the capital loss  carryover) is $8,000 (that is, $12,000 net long-term capital gain less  $4,000 net short-term capital loss computed without regard to the  capital loss carryover of $5,000). The tax attributable to the excess of  net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss (computed by  taking the capital loss carryover into account) is $750, that is, 25  percent of such excess of $3,000, computed under section 1201(a)(2). The  difference of $7,250 ($8,000 less $750) is the amount allowable as a  deduction in computing accumulated taxable income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 631(c) (relating to gain or loss in the case of disposal  of coal or domestic iron ore) shall have no application in determining  the amount of the deduction allowable under section 535(b)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Capital loss carrybacks and carryovers. Capital losses carried  to a taxable year under section 1212(a) shall have no application for  purposes of computing accumulated taxable income for such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Bank affiliates. There is allowed the deduction provided by  section 601   in the case of bank affiliates (as defined in section 2 of the Banking  Act of 1933; 12 U. S. C. 221a(c)).
