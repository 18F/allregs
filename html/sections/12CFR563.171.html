The OTS may conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of a savings association at least once during each 18-month period, rather than each 12-month period as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The savings association has total assets of less than $500 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The savings association is well capitalized as defined in Sec. 565.4 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At its most recent examination, the OTS--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assigned the savings association a rating of 1 or 2 for management as part of the savings association's composite rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (commonly referred to as CAMELS), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determined that the savings association was in outstanding or good condition, that is, it received a composite rating, as defined in Sec. 516.5(c) of this chapter, of 1 or 2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The savings association currently is not subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order by the OTS or the FDIC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No person acquired control of the savings association during the preceding 12-month period in which a full-scope, on-site examination would have been required but for this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority to conduct more frequent examinations.
