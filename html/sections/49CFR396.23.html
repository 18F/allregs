In using the roadside inspection, the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider would need to retain a copy of an annual inspection report showing that the inspection was performed in accordance with the

If the motor carrier operating the commercial vehicle is not the party directly responsible for its maintenance, the motor carrier must deliver the roadside inspection report to the responsible party in a timely manner. Before accepting such an inspection report, the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider must ensure that the report complies with the requirements of Sec. 396.21(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> If a commercial motor vehicle is subject to a mandatory State inspection program which is determined by the Administrator to be as effective as Sec. 396.17, the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider must meet the requirement of Sec. 396.17 through that State's inspection program. Commercial motor vehicle inspections may be conducted by State personnel, at State authorized commercial facilities, or by the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider itself under the auspices of a State authorized self-inspection program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a commercial motor vehicle is subject to a mandatory State inspection program which is determined by the Administrator to be as effective as Sec. 396.17, the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider must meet the requirement of Sec. 396.17 through that State's inspection program.
