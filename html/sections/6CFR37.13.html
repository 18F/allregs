                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> States shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicant does not have more than one driver's license or identification card already issued by that State under a different identity. In States where an individual is permitted to hold both a driver's license and identification card, the State shall ensure that the individual has not been issued identification documents in multiple or different names. States shall also comply with the provisions of Sec. 37.29 before issuing a driver's license or identification card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States must verify the documents and information required under Sec. 37.11 with the issuer of the document. States shall use systems for electronic validation of document and identity data as they become available or use alternative methods approved by DHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> States shall verify any document described in Sec. 37.11(c) or (g) and issued by DHS (including, but not limited to, the I-94 form described in Sec. 37.11(c)(vi)) through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system or alternate methods approved by DHS, except that if two DHS-issued documents are presented, a SAVE verification of one document that confirms lawful status does not need to be repeated for the second document. In the event of a non-match, the DMV must not issue a REAL ID driver's license or identification card to an applicant, and must refer the individual to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for resolution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> States must verify SSNs with the Social Security Administration (SSA) or through another method approved by DHS. In the event of a non-match with SSA, a State may use existing procedures to resolve non-matches. If the State is unable to resolve the non-match, and the use of an exceptions process is not warranted in the situation, the DMV must not issue a REAL ID driver's license or identification card to an applicant until the information verifies with SSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> States must verify birth certificates presented by applicants. States should use the Electronic Verification of Vital Events (EVVE) system or other electronic systems whenever the records are available. If the document does not appear authentic upon inspection or the data does not match and the use of an exceptions process is not warranted in the situation, the State must not issue a REAL ID driver's license or identification card to the applicant until the information verifies, and should refer the individual to the issuing office for resolution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> States shall verify documents issued by the Department of State with the Department of State or through methods approved by DHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> States must verify REAL ID driver's licenses and identification cards with the State of issuance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Nothing in this section precludes a State from issuing an interim license

or a license issued under Sec. 37.71 that will not be accepted for official purposes to allow the individual to resolve any non-match.</p>
