                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A benzene baseline application must be submitted for each refinery that plans to generate early credits under Sec. 80.1275. The application must include the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section and must be submitted to EPA at least 60 days before the first averaging period in which the refinery plans to generate early credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For U.S. Postal delivery, the benzene baseline application shall be sent to: Attn: MSAT2 Benzene, Mail Stop 6406J, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. For commercial delivery: MSAT2 Benzene, 202-343-9038, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1310 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The benzene baseline application must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A listing of the names and addresses of all refineries owned by the company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The benzene baseline for gasoline produced in 2004-2005 at the refinery, calculated in accordance with Sec. 80.1280.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copies of the annual reports required under Sec. 80.75 for RFG and Sec. 80.105 for conventional gasoline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A letter signed by the president, chief operating officer, or chief executive officer, of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the benzene baseline determination is true to the best of his/her knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Name, address, phone number, facsimile number and e-mail address of a corporate contact person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For a refinery that may be eligible to generate early credits under Sec. 80.1270(a)(2)(ii), a refiner may submit to EPA a benzene baseline application per the requirements of this section. The refiner must also submit information regarding the nature and cause of the refinery's production activity that resulted in irregular or less than full production, how it affected the baseline benzene concentration, and whether and how an alternative calculation to the calculation specified in Sec. 80.1280 produces a more representative benzene baseline value. Upon consideration of the submitted information, EPA may approve a benzene baseline for such a refinery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EPA will notify the refiner of approval of the refinery's benzene baseline or any deficiencies in the application. However, except for applications submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the refinery's benzene baseline application may be considered approved 60 days after EPA's receipt of the baseline application, subject to paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If at any time the baseline submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section is determined to be incorrect, EPA will notify the refiner of the corrected baseline.</p>
