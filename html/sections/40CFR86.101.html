                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. This subpart describes test procedures for  measuring exhaust, evaporative, and refueling emissions from motor  vehicles subject to emission standards under subpart S of this part.  This generally includes light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks,   and complete heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR. The  following provisions apply for all testing under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provisions of this subpart apply to tests performed by both the  Administrator and manufacturers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> References in this subpart to engine families and emission  control systems apply to durability groups and test groups as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as noted, heavy-duty vehicles are subject to all the same  provisions of this subpart that apply to light-duty trucks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The procedures in this subpart apply for testing vehicles  powered by any fuel, except as specified in subpart S of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For exhaust emission testing, measure emissions for all  pollutants with an applicable emission standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All emission control systems designed for production vehicles  must be functioning during testing. Maintenance to correct component  malfunction or failure must be authorized in accordance with  Sec. 86.1834.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The test sequence for the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) includes  steps to precondition vehicles for evaporative emission measurements;  these steps are required for exhaust testing whether or not testing  includes evaporative emission measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Evaporative emission measurement procedures of this subpart  include specifications for testing methanol-fueled vehicles. For  vehicles fueled with other oxygenated fuels, use good engineering  judgment to apply these procedures. For example, if you are testing an  ethanol-fueled vehicle, perform diagnostics in your evaporative emission  enclosure with ethanol and propane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For exhaust emission testing with ethanol-gasoline blends that  have less than 25% ethanol by volume, if you use NMHC-to-NMOG conversion  factors instead of measuring oxygenates as described in 40 CFR 1066.635,  the testing specifications and diagnostic requirements in this part 86  that are specific to ethanol-gasoline blends do not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Migration to 40 CFR parts 1065 and 1066. This subpart  transitions to rely on the test procedure specifications in 40 CFR parts  1065 and 1066 as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Through model year 2021, manufacturers may use the test  procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or, using  good engineering judgement, elements of both. For any EPA testing before  model year 2022, EPA will use the manufacturer's selected procedures for  applying acceptable speed-tolerance criteria (either Sec. 86.115-78 or  40 CFR 1066.425(c)). For any other parameters, EPA may conduct testing  using either of the specified procedures. As allowed under this part,  manufacturers may use carryover data from previous model years to  demonstrate compliance with emission standards, without regard to the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers must use the following procedures before model  year 2022:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For vehicles certified to any of the Tier 3 emission standards  specified in subpart S of this part, determine overall driver accuracy  based on drive-cycle metrics as described in 40 CFR 1066.425(j).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equipment specifications and measurement procedures that are  specific to PM emissions from 40 CFR part 1066 apply for any vehicles  certified to the Tier 3 PM emission standards specified in subpart S of  this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use 40 CFR 1066.635 to determine NMOG for any vehicles  certified to the Tier 3 NMOG+NOX emission standards in  subpart S of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For model years 2022 and later, manufacturers must use the test  procedures specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Manufacturers may  continue to use data based on the test procedures specified in paragraph  (c) of this section for an engine family in 2022 and later model years,  as long as the engine family is eligible for certification with  carryover emission data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interim procedures. Test vehicles as described in this subpart  for the appropriate model year, through model year 2021, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 86.106 through 86.115 set forth general testing  specifications and equipment requirements. Sections 86.116 through  86.126 discuss calibration methods and frequency. Sections 86.127  through 86.145 describe procedures for   measuring exhaust and evaporative emissions. Sections 86.146 through  86.157 lay out refueling test procedures. Sections 86.158 through 86.166  cover procedures related to the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure and  testing related to air conditioning systems. The test procedure for  measuring fuel system leaks is described in 40 CFR 1066.985.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternate equipment, procedures, and calculation methods may be  used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results, and if approved  in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Long-term procedures. Test vehicles as described in 40 CFR parts  1065 and 1066. The following requirements from this subpart also apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use fuel for testing and service accumulation as specified in  Sec. 86.113.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Perform evaporative emission tests as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use evaporative testing equipment meeting the specifications in  Sec. 86.107. This equipment must meet calibration requirements as  specified in Sec. 86.117.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Generate fuel test temperature profiles as described in  Sec. 86.129-94(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Follow the general provisions and driving schedules described  in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart I. Evaporative testing consists of vehicle  preconditioning as described in Sec. 86.132, diurnal measurement as  described in Sec. 86.133, running loss testing as described in  Sec. 86.134, and hot soak testing as described in Sec. 86.138.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Calculate emission results as described in Sec. 86.143.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keep records as described in Sec. 86.142</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Perform refueling emission tests, calculate emission results,  and keep associated records as described in Sec. 86.146 through 86.157.
