If the distribution is not a redemption to which  section 302(a) or 303 applies or in partial or complete liquidation of  the association, then to the extent that the distribution is not out of  earnings and profits of the taxable year (within the meaning of section  316(a)(2)) or out of earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1951, the distribution shall be treated as  made out of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First, the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans  (determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph), to the extent  thereof,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, the supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the  extent thereof, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Finally, such other accounts as may be proper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions in redemption of stock or in liquidation. If the  distribution is a redemption to which section 302(a) or 303 applies, or  in partial or complete liquidation of the association, the distribution  shall be treated as made out of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First, the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans  (as determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph), to the extent  thereof,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, the supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the  extent thereof,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Third, earnings and profits of the taxable year (within the  meaning of section 316(a)(2)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fourth, earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1951, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Finally, such other accounts as may be proper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule.

This section may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation, a domestic building and loan  association having nonwithdrawable capital stock represented by shares,  was organized in 1946, and makes its returns on the basis of the  calendar year and the reserve method of accounting for bad debts. As of  the close of December 31, 1962, X had $6,900 of earnings and  profitsaccumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1951.  X's taxable income for 1963 is $30,000 (computed prior to the inclusion  of any amount in gross income for such year under section 593(f)) and  during such year X received tax-exempt interest of $500. X's earnings  and profits for 1963 (computed at the close of the taxable year without  diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year)  is $20,400. The opening balance of X's reserve for losses on qualifying  real property loans as of the close of December 31, 1962 (determined  under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(a) of Sec. 1.593-7) was $24,500. Pre-1963  reserves of $22,500 were included in such opening balance, but it is  assumed that pre-1963 reserves of only $2,500 would have been included  in the opening balance if the opening balance had been determined under  the experience method described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(b) of  Sec. 1.593-7. Pre-1952 surplus of $2,000 was deemed included in such  opening balance under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.593-8. The deductible  addition to such reserve for 1963 is $47,000. It is assumed that the  addition to such reserve for 1963 would have been $2,200 if such  addition had been computed under the experience method described in  paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.593-6. On each of four dates during 1963  (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1), X made a $12,000  distribution (which was not a redemption to which section 302(a) or 303  applied or in partial or complete liquidation of X) to its shareholders  with respect to its stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans. For  purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, X's reserve for losses  on qualifying real property loans is $64,800, computed as follows:  Closing balance of reserve for losses on qualifying real         $71,500</p><p class="depth0">property loans after addition for 1963 ($24,500 opening</p><p class="depth0">balance plus $47,000 addition)..............................

Of each $12,000 quarterly  distribution, $5,100 ($20,400) earnings and profits of the taxable year  divided by 4) is out of X's earnings and profits of the taxable year  (within the meaning of section 316(a)(2)); the remainder of the January  1 distribution, $6,900 ($12,000 minus $5,100), is out of X's earnings  andprofits accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31,  1951. Since $20,700 ($6,900 multiplied by 3) is not out of X's earnings  and profits, such amount shall be treated as made out of X's reserve for  losses on qualifying real property loans (as determined under  subdivision (ii) of this example).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amount charged against reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans and included in gross income. The reserve for losses on  qualifying real property loans is charged with, and X's gross income for  1963 is increased by, $43,124, which is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $64,800 (the reserve as of December 31, 1963, as determined  under subdivision (ii) of this example), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> $43,124, i.e., the amount which, when reduced by the amount of  income tax attributable to the inclusion of such amount in gross income,  $22,424 ($43,124 multiplied by a tax rate of 52 percent), is equal to  the amount of such distribution, $20,700.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in example 1 and the  following additional facts: X's taxable income for 1964 is $6,000. The  deductible addition to the reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans for 1964 is $11,000, but it is assumed that only $2,676  would have been the addition to such reserve for 1964 if such addition  had been computed under the experience method described in paragraph (d)  of Sec. 1.593-6. On December 31, 1964, X makes a $10,000 distribution in  a redemption to which section 302(a) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans. For  purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)   of this section, X's reserve for losses on qualifying real property  loans is $30,000, computed as follows:  Closing balance of reserve for losses on qualifying real         $82,500</p><p class="depth0">property loans after addition for 1964 ($71,500 opening</p><p class="depth0">balance plus $11,000 addition)..............................

The reserve for losses on  qualifying real property loans is charged with, and X's gross income for  1964 is increased by, $12,820, which is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $30,000 (the reserve as of December 31, 1964, as determined  under subdivision (ii) of this example), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> $12,820, i.e., the amount which, when reduced by the amount of  income tax attributable to the inclusion of such amount in gross income,  $2,820 ($12,820 multiplied by a tax rate of 22 percent), is equal to the  amount of such distribution, $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation, a domestic building and loan  association having nonwithdrawable capital stock represented by shares,  was organized in 1946, and makes its returns on the basis of the  calendar year and the reserve method of accounting for bad debts. As of  the close of December 31, 1962, X had $6,900 of earnings and profits  accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1951. X's  taxable income for 1963 is $30,000 (computed prior to the inclusion of  any amount in gross income for such year under section 593(f)) and  during such year X received tax-exempt interest of $500. X's earnings  and profits for 1963 (computed at the close of the taxable year without  diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year)  is $20,400. The opening balance of X's reserve for losses on qualifying  real property loans as of theclose of December 31, 1962 (determined  under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(a) of Sec. 1.593-7) was $24,500. Pre-1963  reserves of $24,500 were included in such opening balance, but it is  assumed that pre-1963 reserves of only $4,500 would have been included  in the opening balance if the opening balance had been determined under  the experience method described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(b) of  Sec. 1.593-7. The deductible addition to such reserve for 1963 is $500.  It is assumed that the addition to such reserve for 1963 would have been  $100 if such addition had been computed under the experience method  described in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.593-6. As of December 31, 1963, the  balance of X's supplemental reserve for losses on loans is $30,000. On  each of four dates during 1963 (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October  1), X made a $12,000 distribution (which was not a redemption to which  section 302(a) or 303 applied or in partial or complete liquidation of  X) to its shareholders with respect to its stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans. For  purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, X's reserve for losses  on qualifying real property loans is $20,400, computed as follows:  Closing balance of reserve for losses on qualifying real         $25,000</p><p class="depth0">property loans after addition for 1963 ($24,500 opening</p><p class="depth0">balance plus $500 addition).................................
