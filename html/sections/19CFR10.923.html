                                Sec. 10.923  Packing materials and containers for shipment.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect on tariff shift rule. Packing materials and containers  for shipment, as defined in Sec. 10.913(m) of this subpart, are to be  disregarded in determining whether the non-originating materials used in  the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff  classification set out in General Note 32(n), HTSUS. Accordingly, such  materials and containers are not required to undergo the applicable  change in tariff classification even if they are non-originating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect on regional value content calculation. Packing materials  and containers for shipment, as defined in   Sec. 10.913(m) of this subpart, are to be disregarded in determining  the regional value content of a good imported into the United States.  Accordingly, in applying the build-down, build-up, or net cost method  for determining the regional value content of a good imported into the  United States, the value of such packing materials and containers for  shipment (whether originating or non-originating) is disregarded and not  included in AV, adjusted value, VNM, value of non-originating materials,  VOM, value of originating materials, or NC, net cost of a good.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Peruvian producer A produces good C. Producer A ships good  C to the United States in a shipping container that it purchased from  Company B in Peru. The shipping container is originating. The value of  the shipping container determined under section Sec. 10.916(a)(2) of  this subpart is $3. Good C is subject to a regional value content  requirement. The transaction value of good C is $100, which includes the  $3 shipping container. The U.S. importer decides to use the build-up  method, RVC = (VOM/AV) x 100 (see Sec. 10.915(c) of this subpart), in  determining whether good C satisfies the regional value content  requirement. In determining the AV, adjusted value, of good C imported  into the U.S., paragraph (b) of this section and the definition of AV  require a $3 deduction for the value of the shipping container.  Therefore, the AV is $97 ($100 - $3). In addition, the value of the  shipping container is disregarded and not included in the VOM, value of  originating materials.</p>
