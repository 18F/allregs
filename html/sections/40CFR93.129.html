participate in a conformity pilot program and have developed alternative requirements that have been approved by EPA as an implementation plan revision in accordance with Sec. 51.390 of this chapter. For the duration of the pilot program, areas selected to participate in the pilot program must comply with the conformity requirements of the pilot area's implementation plan revision for Sec. 51.390 of this chapter and all other requirements in 40 CFR parts 51 and 93 that are not covered by the pilot area's implementation plan revision for Sec. 51.390 of this chapter. The alternative conformity requirements in conjunction with any applicable state and/or federal conformity requirements must be proposed to fulfill all of the requirements of and achieve results equivalent to or better than section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act. After the three-year duration of the pilot program has expired, areas will again be subject to all of the requirements of this subpart and 40 CFR part 51, subpart T, and/or to the requirements of any implementation plan revision that was previously approved by EPA in accordance with Sec. 51.390 of this chapter.
