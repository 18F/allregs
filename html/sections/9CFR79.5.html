                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certificates are required as specified by Sec. 79.3 for certain interstate movements of animals. A certificate must show the official ear tag number, individual animal registered breed association registration tattoo, individual animal registered breed association registration brand, individual animal registered breed association registration number, and any other official individual identification of each animal to be moved; provided that, in the case of animals identified with premises identification \4\ that is assigned to the flock of origin and that meets the requirements for individual animal identification, the premises number may be recorded instead of the individual identification numbers. A certificate must also show the number of animals covered by the certificate; the purpose for which the animals are to be moved; the points of origin and destination; the consignor, and the consignee. Certificates must indicate the flock of birth for any breeding sheep born after January 1, 2002, that are covered by the certificate. The certificate must include a statement by the issuing accredited or State or Federal veterinarian that the animals were not exhibiting clinical signs associated with scrapie at the time of examination and an owner statement indicating whether the animal is or is not a scrapie-positive, suspect, high-risk or exposed animal and whether it originated in an infected, source, exposed, or noncompliant flock. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all of the information required by this paragraph must be typed or written on the certificate. Note that in accordance with Sec. 79.3(a), (b), and (c), scrapie-positive, suspect, and high-risk animals, some exposed animals, and animals that originated in an infected or source flock require permits rather than certificates.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ Ownership brands may be used on certificates for sheep and goats moved interstate when premises identification is required under this part, provided the ownership brands are legible and are registered with the official brand recording agency and the animals are accompanied by a brand inspection certificate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Animal identification documents attached to certificates. As an alternative to typing or writing individual animal identification on a certificate, another document may be used to provide this information, but only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The document must be a State form or APHIS form that requires individual identification of animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A legible copy of the document must be stapled to the original and each copy of the certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each copy of the document must identify each animal to be moved with the certificate, but any information pertaining to other animals, and any unused space on the document for recording animal identification, must be crossed out in ink; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following information must be typed or written in ink in the identification column on the original and each copy of the certificate and must be circled or boxed, also in ink, so that no additional information can be added:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either the serial number on the document or, if the document is not imprinted with a serial number, both the name of the person who prepared the document and the date the document was signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ownership brands documents attached to certificates. As an alternative to typing or writing ownership brands on a certificate, an official brand inspection certificate may be used to provide this information, but only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A legible copy of the official brand inspection certificate must be stapled to the original and each copy of the certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each copy of the official brand inspection certificate must show the ownership brand of each animal to be moved with the certificate, but any other ownership brands, and any unused space for recording ownership brands, must be crossed out in ink; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following information must be typed or written in ink in the official identification column on the original and each copy of the certificate and must be circled or boxed, also in ink, so that no additional information can be added:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the attached document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either the serial number on the official brand inspection certificate or, if the official brand inspection certificate is not imprinted with a serial number, both the name of the person who prepared the official brand inspection certificate and the date it was signed.</p>
