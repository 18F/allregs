The purpose  of these regulations is to advance the general intent of title VI of the  Clean Water Act, which is to ensure that each State's program is  designed and operated to continue providing assistance for water  pollution control activities in perpetuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These regulations reflect statutory and program requirements  that have been previously published in the Initial Guidance for State  Revolving Funds, which was signed by the Assistant Administrator for  Water on January 28, 1988, and the supplementary   memorandum to the Initial Guidance for State Revolving Funds, which was  signed by the Assistant Administrator for Water on September 30, 1988.  Copies of both documents can be obtained by writing the Office of  Municipal Pollution Control (WH-546), Environmental Protection Agency,  1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> These regulations supplement title VI by codifying all major  program requirements, applicable to the SRF program. EPA will not impose  additional major program requirements without an opportunity for  affected parties to comment. The process for amending this regulation to  incorporate these requirements will begin within three months of their  issuance.</p>
