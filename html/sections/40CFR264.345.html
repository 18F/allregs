These will be specified on a case-by-case basis as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or in alternative data as specified in Sec. 264.344(b) and included with part B of a facility's permit application) to be sufficient to comply with the performance standards of Sec. 264.343.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the waste feed (including acceptable variations in the physical or chemical properties of the waste feed which will not affect compliance with the performance requirement of Sec. 264.343) to which the operating requirements apply.
