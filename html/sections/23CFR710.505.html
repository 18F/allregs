                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Donations of property being acquired. A non-governmental owner whose real property is required for a Federal-aid project may donate the property to the STD. Prior to accepting the property, the owner must be informed by the agency of his/her right to receive just compensation for the property. The owner shall also be informed of his/her right to an appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser, unless the STD determines that an appraisal is unnecessary because the valuation problem is uncomplicated and the fair market value is estimated at no more than $2500, or the State appraisal waiver limit approved by the FHWA, whichever is greater. All donations of property received prior to the approval of the NEPA document must meet environmental requirements as specified in 23 U.S.C. 323(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit for donations. Donations of real property may be credited to the State's matching share of the project. Credit to the State's matching share for donated property shall be based on fair market value established on the earlier of the following: either the date on which the donation becomes effective, or the date on which equitable title to the property vests in the State. The fair market value shall not include increases or decreases in value caused by the project. Donations may be made at anytime during the development of a project. The STD shall develop sufficient documentation to indicate compliance with paragraph (a) of this section and to support the amount of credit applied. The total credit cannot exceed the State's pro-rata share under the project agreement to which it is applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Donations and conveyances in exchange for construction features or services. A property owner may donate property in exchange for construction features or services. The value of the donation is limited to the fair market value of property donated less the cost of the construction features or services. If the value of the donated property exceeds the cost of the construction features or services, the difference may be eligible for a credit to the State's share of project costs.</p>
