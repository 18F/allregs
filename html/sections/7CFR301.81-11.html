                            <p class="depth0">This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement. Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.81-6. Such compliance agreements shall state the specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on shipments of regulated articles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Detection. (1) Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to eliminate the colonies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Control. Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in a nursery that meets the requirements of this section. Nursery owners must implement a treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed soil surfaces (including sod and mulched areas) on property where plants are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at least once every 6 months. The first application must be performed early in the spring. Followup treatments with a contact insecticide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter must be applied to eliminate all remaining colonies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exclusion. (1) For plants grown on the premises, treatment of soil or potting media in accordance with part 305 of this chapter prior to planting is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For plants grown on the premises, treatment of soil or potting media in accordance with part 305 of this chapter prior to planting is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For plants received from outside sources, to prevent the spread into a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested nursery plants, all plants must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtained from nurseries that comply with the requirements of this section and that operate under a compliance agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.81-6; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treated upon delivery in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, and within the specified number of days be either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Repotted in treated potting soil media;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Retreated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at the specified interval; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Shipped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement. (1) The nursery owner must maintain records of the nursery's surveys and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records must be made available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nursery owner must maintain records of the nursery's surveys and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records must be made available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an inspection

by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for movement will be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment. During this period, certification may be based upon treatments for plants in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin must cease its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are being followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.
