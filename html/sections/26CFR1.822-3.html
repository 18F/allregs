                            <p class="depth0">Section 822(d)(2) makes provision for the appropriate amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount, attributable to the taxable year, on bonds, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821. Such

amortization and accrual is the same as that provided for life insurance companies by section 803(i) and shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.803-6, except that in determining the premium and discount of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 the basis provided in section 1012 shall be used in lieu of the acquisition value.</p>
