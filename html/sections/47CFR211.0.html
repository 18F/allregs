                            <p class="depth0">This part establishes policies and procedures under which government and private entities will be furnished restoration priorities to insure that leased intercity private line telecommunications services vital to the national interest will be maintained during the continuance of a war in which the United States engaged. It supersedes the Director of Telecommunications Management Order of January 15, 1967 (32 FR 791, 47 CFR part 201), which is hereby canceled. To assure the effective ability to implement its provisions, and also in order that government and industry resources may be used effectively under all conditions ranging from national emergencies to international crises, including nuclear attack, a single set of rules and procedures is essential, and they must be applied on a day-to-day basis so that the priorities they establish can be implemented at once when the occasion arises. As provided for in part 18 of Executive Order 11490, as amended (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 820), policies, plans, and procedures developed pursuant to the Executive order shall be in consonance with the plans and policies contained in this part.</p>
