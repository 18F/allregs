                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act if he determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The National Health Service Corps site is financially unable to meet the reimbursement requirements or that compliance with those requirements will unreasonably limit the ability of the site to adequately support the provision of services by assigned Corps personnel. In making these determinations, the Secretary will consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The costs necessary to adequately support the health services provided by the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel and the income and financial resources available to meet the costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ability of the applicant to obtain credit from suppliers, lending institutions, private organizations and individuals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need of the health manpower shortage area for health services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which the National Health Service Corps site utilizes health professions personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A significant percentage of the individuals who are located in the health manpower shortage area and are receiving the health services of the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel are elderly, living in poverty, or have other characteristics which indicate an inability to pay. For purposes of this section, ``elderly'' means persons 65 years or older and the ``CSA Income Poverty Guidelines'' will be used as the standard for determining whether individuals are living in poverty. Other characteristics indicating inability to pay include, but are not to be limited to, the ratio of unemployment in the health manpower shortage area and the area's cost-of-living index.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act if he or she determines that the National Health Service Corps site is a small health center (as defined by section 334(f)(5) of the Act) that needs all

or part of the amount otherwise payable to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Expand or improve its provision of health services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increase the number of individuals served;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Renovate or modernize facilities for its provision of health services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Improve the administration of its health service programs; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Establish a financial reserve to assure its ability to continue providing health services;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the Secretary determines that a National Health Service Corps site is eligible for a waiver under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. the Secretary may waive the application of the reimbursement requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act and apply the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act. The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) for such a site if he or she determines that the National Health Service Corps site meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Funds retained by a National Health Service Corps site as a result of such waiver must be used for the purposes set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requests for a prospective or retrospective waiver must be made at the time and in the manner and contain the documentation prescribed by the Secretary.
