                                Sec. 663.230  What criteria must be used to determine whether an   employment leading to ``self-sufficiency''?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">State Boards or Local Boards must set the criteria for determining  whether employment leads to self-sufficiency. At a minimum, such  criteria must provide that self-sufficiency means employment that pays  at least the lower living standard income level, as defined in WIA  section 101(24). Self-sufficiency for a dislocated worker may be defined  in relation to a percentage of the layoff wage. The special needs of  individuals with disabilities or other barriers to employment should be  taken into account when setting criteria to determine self-sufficiency.</p>
