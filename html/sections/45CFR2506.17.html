                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have the right to request a review  by the Corporation of the existence or the amount of your debt, the  proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or  whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. If you want a  review, you must send a written request to the Corporation official  designated in the notice (see Sec. 2506.16(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must sign your request for review and fully identify and  explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and  witnesses that support your position. Your request for review should be  accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your request for review must be received by the designated  officer or employee of the Corporation on or before the 60th calendar  day following the date of the notice. Timely filing   will stay the commencement of collection procedures. The Corporation may  consider requests filed after the 60-day period provided for in this  section if you:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond  your control; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had  actual notice of the filing deadline).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection of the Corporation records related to the debt. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  If you want to inspect or copy the Corporation records related to the  debt (see Sec. 2506.14(a)(5)), you must send a letter to the  Corporation official designated in the notice. Your letter must be  received within 30 days of the date of the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, the designated Corporation official will notify you of  the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to  the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If personal inspection of the Corporation records related to the  debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you  copies of those records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review official. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When required by Federal law or regulation,  such as in a salary offset situation, the Corporation will request an  administrative law judge, or hearing official from another agency who is  not under the supervision or control of the Chief Executive Officer, to  conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following  the review, submit the review decision to the Chief Executive Officer  for the issuance of the Corporation's final decision (see paragraph (f)  of this section for content of the review decision).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When Federal law or regulation does not require the Corporation  to have the review conducted by an administrative law judge, or by a  hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or  control of the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporation has the right to  appoint a hearing official to conduct the review. In these cases, the  hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision  to the Chief Executive Officer for the issuance of the Corporation's  final decision (see paragraph (f) of this section for the content of the  review decision).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Review procedure. If you request a review, the review official  will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review  official will determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a  review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the FCCS.  Although you may request an oral hearing, such a hearing is required  only when a review of the documentary evidence cannot determine the  question of indebtedness, such as when the validity of the debt turns on  an issue of credibility or truthfulness. In either case, the review  official will conduct the review in accordance with the FCCS. If the  review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the  review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Date of decision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The review official will issue a written  decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence  and information developed at an oral hearing. This decision will be  issued as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date  on which the Corporation received your request for a review, unless you  request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Corporation is unable to issue a decision within 60 days  after the receipt of the request for a hearing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Corporation may not issue a withholding order or take other  action until the review (in whatever form) is held and a decision is  rendered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Corporation previously issued a withholding order to the  debtor's employer, the Corporation must suspend the withholding order  beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the review request and  continuing until a review (in whatever form) is held and a decision is  rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Content of review decision. The review official will prepare a  written decision that includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the facts presented to support the origin,  nature, and amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interest, penalty charge, and administrative cost accrual during  review period. Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs  authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.</p>
