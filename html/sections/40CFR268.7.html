                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for generators: (1) A generator of hazardous waste  must determine if the waste has to be treated before it can be land  disposed. This is done by determining if the hazardous waste meets the  treatment standards in Sec.  268.40, 268.45, or Sec.  268.49. This  determination can be made concurrently with the hazardous waste  determination required in Sec.  262.11 of this chapter, in either of two  ways: testing the waste or using knowledge of the waste. If the  generator tests the waste, testing would normally determine the total  concentration of hazardous constituents, or the concentration of  hazardous constituents in an extract of the waste obtained using test  method 1311 in ``Test Methods of Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/ Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW-846, (incorporated by reference,  see Sec.  260.11 of this chapter), depending on whether the treatment  standard for the waste is expressed as a total concentration or  concentration of hazardous constituent in the waste's extract.  (Alternatively, the generator must send the waste to a RCRA-permitted  hazardous waste treatment facility, where the waste treatment facility  must comply with the requirements of Sec.  264.13 of this chapter and  paragraph (b) of this section.) In addition, some hazardous wastes must  be treated by particular treatment methods before they can be land  disposed and some soils are contaminated by such hazardous wastes. These  treatment standards are also found in Sec.  268.40, and are described in  detail in Sec.  268.42, Table 1. These wastes, and soils contaminated  with such wastes, do not need to be tested (however, if they are in a  waste mixture, other wastes with concentration level treatment standards  would have to be tested). If a generator determines they are managing a  waste or soil contaminated with a waste, that displays a hazardous  characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity,  they must comply with the special requirements of Sec.  268.9 of this  part in addition to any applicable requirements in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>'' of the Generator Paperwork  Requirements Table in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (Alternatively,  if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether the  waste must be treated, the notification must include the EPA Hazardous  Waste Numbers and Manifest Number of the first shipment and must state  ``This hazardous waste may or may not be subject to the LDR treatment  standards. The treatment facility must make the determination.'') No  further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or  facility change, in which case a new notification must be sent and a  copy placed in the generator's file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the waste or contaminated soil meets the treatment standard  at the original point of generation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the initial shipment of waste to each treatment, storage,  or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice  to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility receiving the waste,  and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information  indicated in column ``268.7(a)(3)'' of the Generator Paperwork  Requirements Table in Sec.  268.7(a)(4) and the following certification  statement, signed by an authorized representative:</p><p class="depth0">I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and  am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through  knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste  complies with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR part 268  subpart D. I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate,  and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for  submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine  and imprisonment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For contaminated soil, with the initial shipment of wastes to  each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a  one-time written notice to each facility receiving the waste and place a  copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column  ``268.7(a)(3)'' of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in Sec.   268.7(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice and  certification to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their  files. Generators of hazardous debris excluded from the definition of  hazardous waste under Sec.  261.3(f) of this chapter are not subject to  these requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>'' of the Generator Paperwork  Requirements Table below.

(Generators treating hazardous  debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1, Sec.   268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.)  The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the  following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and  physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s)  being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the  waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this part, including the  selected testing frequency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such plan must be kept in the facility's on-site files and made  available to inspectors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply  with the notification requirements of Sec.  268.7(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a generator determines that the waste or contaminated soil is  restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting  data used to make this determination must be retained on-site in the  generator's files.

The three year record  retention period is automatically extended during the course of any  unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as  requested by the Administrator. The requirements of this paragraph apply  to solid wastes even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior  to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition of  hazardous or solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6, or exempted  from Subtitle C regulation, subsequent to the point of generation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If a generator is managing a lab pack containing hazardous  wastes and wishes to use the alternative treatment standard for lab  packs found at Sec.  268.42(c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the initial shipment of waste to a treatment facility, the  generator must submit a notice that provides the information in column  ``Sec.  268.7(a)(9)'' in the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table of  paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and the following certification. The  certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative and  must be placed in the generator's files, must say the following:</p><p class="depth0">I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and  am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains only wastes  that have not been excluded under appendix IV to 40 CFR part 268 and  that this lab pack will be sent to a combustion facility in compliance  with the alternative treatment standards for lab packs at 40 CFR  268.42(c).
