                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the  ultimate purchaser of each new engine, subject to the standards  prescribed in Sec. 94.8, written instructions for the proper maintenance  and use of the engine as are reasonable and necessary to assure the  proper functioning of the emissions control system, consistent with the  applicable provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maintenance and use instructions required by this section  shall be clear and easily understandable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maintenance instructions required by this section shall  contain a general description of the documentation that would  demonstrate for warranty purposes that the ultimate purchaser or any  subsequent owner had complied with the instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Category 3 engines, the manufacturer must provide in  boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions  notice that Sec. 94.1004 requires that the emissions-related maintenance  be performed as specified in the instructions (or equivalent).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must provide in boldface type on the first  page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance,  replacement, or repair of the emission control devices   and systems may be performed by any engine repair establishment or  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The instructions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will not  include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's or owner's using, in  connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a  component or service provided without charge under the terms of the  purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate  name. Such instructions also will not directly or indirectly distinguish  between service performed by any other service establishments with which  such manufacturer has a commercial relationship and service performed by  independent vessel or engine repair facilities with which such  manufacturer has no commercial relationship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prohibition of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be  waived by the Administrator if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's  satisfaction that the engine will function properly only if the  component or service so identified is used in connection with such  engine; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator, no later  than the time of the submission required by Sec. 94.203, a copy of the  emission-related maintenance instructions that the manufacturer proposes  to supply to the ultimate purchaser or owner in accordance with this  section. The Administrator will review such instructions to determine  whether they are reasonable and necessary to ensure the proper  functioning of the engine's emission control systems. If the  Administrator determines that such instructions are not reasonable and  necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the emission control  systems, he/she may disapprove the application for certification or may  require that the manufacturer modify the instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any revision to the maintenance instructions which will affect  emissions shall be supplied to the Administrator at least 30 days before  being supplied to the ultimate purchaser or owner unless the  Administrator consents to a lesser period of time, and is subject to the  provisions of Sec. 94.210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> specifies emission-related scheduled  maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data for marine  engines. The maintenance intervals specified in this paragraph are  minimum intervals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of  obtaining durability data must occur at the same or longer hours of use  intervals as those specified in the manufacturer's maintenance  instructions furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the engine under  paragraph (a) of this section. This maintenance schedule may be updated  as necessary throughout the testing of the engine, provided that no  maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the  operation has been performed on the test equipment or engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on  equipment, engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically  necessary to ensure in-use compliance with the emission standards. The  manufacturer must submit data which demonstrate to the Administrator  that all of the emission-related scheduled maintenance which is to be  performed is technologically necessary. Scheduled maintenance must be  approved by the Administrator prior to being performed or being included  in the emission-related maintenance instructions provided to the  purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator may require longer maintenance intervals than  those listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section where the  listed intervals are not technologically necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator may allow manufacturers to specify shorter  maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4)  of this section where technologically necessary for Category 2 engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The maintenance intervals listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and  (e)(4) of this section do not apply for Category 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this   section shall occur at 1,500 hours of use and at 1,500-hour intervals  thereafter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exhaust gas recirculation system-related filters and coolers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Positive crankcase ventilation valve.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fuel injector tips (cleaning only).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(vii)</em> of this section shall occur at 3,000 hours  of use and at 3,000-hour intervals thereafter for engines with per- cylinder displacement less than 1.2 liters, or at 4,500-hour intervals  thereafter for engines with per-cylinder displacement greater than or  equal to 1.2 liters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fuel injectors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Turbocharger.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and  actuators.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system (including related  components).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related control  valves and tubing), except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Catalytic convertor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Any other add-on emission-related component (i.e., a component  whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure  will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not  integral to the design and performance of the engine).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scheduled maintenance not related to emissions which is  reasonable and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter  change, fuel filter change, air filter change, cooling system  maintenance, adjustment of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque,  valve lash, injector lash, timing, lubrication of the exhaust manifold  heat control valve, etc.) may be performed on durability engines at the  least frequent intervals recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate  purchaser, (e.g., not the intervals recommended for severe service).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data engines may be  performed once before the low-hour emission test point. Any other  engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair,  removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data vehicles  shall be performed only with advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, equipment, instruments,  or tools may not be used to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or  defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment,  instruments, or tools will be available to dealerships and other service  outlets and are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such  components; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used subsequent to the identification of an engine malfunction,  as provided in paragraph (e) of this section for emission data engines;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifically authorized by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All test data, maintenance reports, and required engineering  reports shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in  accordance with Sec. 94.215.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(vi)</em> of this section are defined as critical emission-related  components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Catalytic convertor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and  actuators.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related  filters, coolers, control valves, and tubing).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Positive crankcase ventilation valve.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any other add-on emission-related component (i.e., a component  whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure  will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not  integral to the design and performance of the engine).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(vi)</em>  of this section will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of  being performed in use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a  connection between emissions and engine performance such that as  emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will  simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical  operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the  Administrator with an 80 percent confidence level that 80 percent of  such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in- use at the recommended interval(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the  Administrator is installed to alert the equipment operator that  maintenance is due. A signal bearing the message ``maintenance needed''  or ``check engine,'' or a similar message approved by the Administrator,  shall be actuated at the appropriate usage point or by component  failure. This signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation  and not be easily eliminated without performance of the required  maintenance. Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the  maintenance operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall  be approved by the Administrator. The system must not be designed to  deactivate upon the end of the useful life of the engine or thereafter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that  a critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible  signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use  experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a  given model year market up to 200 randomly selected engines per critical  emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, and  monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the owners  to show compliance with paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section. This  option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be  repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical  maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be  sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families  in question.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and  clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the  instructions provided under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The manufacturer uses any other method which the Administrator  approves as establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical  maintenance will be performed in-use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Visible signal systems used under paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this  section are considered an element of design of the emission control  system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such  signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance  procedure is a prohibited act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> For Category 3 engines, the manufacturer must provide the  ultimate purchaser with a Technical File meeting the specifications of  section 2.4 of the Annex VI Technical Code (incorporated by reference in  Sec. 94.5). The maintenance instructions required by this part to be  provided by manufacturer may be included in this Technical File. The  manufacturer must provide a copy of this Technical File to EPA upon  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Owners and operators of Category 3 engines shall transfer the  maintenance instructions to subsequent owners and operators of the  engine upon sale or transfer of the engine or vessel.
