Each request for review must contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the request, if in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the written denial issued under Sec. 2002.21; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced in support of disclosure of the original request for the record.
In order to enable the Inspector General of HUD to comply with the time limitations set forth in Sec. 2002.17, both the envelope containing the request for review and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review will be made promptly by the Inspector General of HUD on the basis of the written record described in paragraph (b) of this section. Before a denial, the Inspector General will obtain the concurrence of legal counsel for the Office of Inspector General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The time of receipt for processing of a request for review purposes is the time it is received by the Inspector General of HUD. If a request is misdirected by the requester and is received by one other than the Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General or Department official who receives the request will forward it promptly to the Inspector General and will advise the requester about the delayed time of receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The decision after review will be in writing, will constitute final agency

action on the request, and, if the denial of the request for records is in full or in part upheld, the Inspector General will notify the person making the request of his or her right to seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
