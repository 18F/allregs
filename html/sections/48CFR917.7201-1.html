Program  opportunity notices will be used to provide information concerning  scientific and technological areas encompassed by DOE's programs. DOE  shall, from time to time, issue program opportunity notices for  proposals for demonstrations of various forms of non-nuclear energy and  technology utilization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each program opportunity notice shall as a minimum describe: the  goal of the intended demonstration effort; the time schedule for award;  evaluation criteria; program policy factors; the amount of cost detail  required; and proposal submission information. Program policy factors  are those factors which, while not appropriate indicators of a  proposal's individual merit (i.e., technical excellence, proposer's  ability, cost, etc.), are relevant and essential to the process of  choosing which of the proposals received will, taken together, best  achieve the program objectives. All such factors shall be predetermined   and specified in the notice so as to notify proposers that factors which  are essentially beyond their control will affect the selection process.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 917.73_Program Research and Development Announcements</p><p class="depth2">Source: 61 FR 41707, Aug. 9, 1996, unless otherwise noted.</p>
