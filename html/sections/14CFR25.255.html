specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During flight tests required by paragraph (a) of this section, the limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in Sec. Sec. 25.333(b) and 25.337, and the maneuvering load factors associated with probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes determined under Sec. 25.251(e), need not be exceeded. In addition, the entry speeds for flight test demonstrations at normal acceleration values less than 1 g must be limited to the extent necessary to accomplish a recovery without exceeding VDF/MDF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this section, it must be possible from an overspeed condition at VDF/MDF to produce at least 1.5 g for recovery by applying not more than 125 pounds of longitudinal control force using either the primary longitudinal control alone or the primary longitudinal control and the longitudinal trim system. If the longitudinal trim is used to assist in producing the required load factor, it must be shown at VDF/MDF that the longitudinal trim can be actuated in the airplane nose-up direction with the primary surface loaded to correspond to the least of the following airplane nose-up control forces:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum control forces expected in service as specified in Sec. Sec. 25.301 and 25.397.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The control force required to produce 1.5 g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The control force corresponding to buffeting or other phenomena of such intensity that it is a strong deterrent to further application of primary longitudinal control force.
