                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The grantee may request approval to use unexpended funds in the next budget period. This is permissible if

funds are to be used for a non-severable, non-recurring project or activity within the scope of the PRIME program. Non-severable means a project in its entirety that cannot be subdivided. The request for using unexpended funds in the next budget period must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SF 424, budget pages, and justification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Explanation of why the funds were not expended during the period in which they were awarded; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of match. The match requirement for funds carried over to the next budget period can be met by using any excess of matching funds from the current budget period, new matching funds, or a combination of both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request must be made no later than 60 days before the end of the budget/project period or the de-obligation process will begin. Approved requests will require the issuance of a revised Notice of Award. Expenditures for funds carried over to the next budget period must be tracked separately.</p>
