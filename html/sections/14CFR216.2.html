The deviation by a foreign air carrier from its  authorized route for the purpose of combined carriage to or from the  United States of nonrevenue or other traffic, the carriage of which does  not constitute engaging in foreign air transportation, is governed by  the provisions of part 375 of this chapter.</p>
