                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initiating appeals. Requesters not satisfied with the FOIA  Officer's decision may request review of the decision by the MCRMC FOIA  Appellate Authority. The appeal must be received within 60 days of the  date of the FOIA Officer's decision. Appeals may be made through the  MCRMC Web site at the FOIA tab or in writing, addressed to: FOIA  Appellate Authority, Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization  Commission, Post Office Box 13170, Arlington, VA 22209. As there may be  delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via  facsimile to (703) 697-8330 or email to foia@mcrmc.gov. The requester  may wish to explain why the Appellate Authority should grant the appeal,  to the extent that an explanation could assist the Appellate Authority  in making a decision on the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal decisions. MCRMC's Chief FOIA Officer will decide the  appeal within 20 days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public  holidays) from the date it receives the appeal. If the appeal is denied,  MCRMC will notify the requester in writing of the decision and the  provisions for judicial review. If the appeal is granted, the Chief FOIA  Officer will notify the requester in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mediation. A response to an appeal will advise the requester of  the 2007 FOIA amendments, which created the Office of Government  Information Services (OGIS), which offers mediation services to resolve  disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive  alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS at: Office of  Government Information Services, National Archives and Records  Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740; email:  ogis@nara.gov; telephone: (202) 741-5770; facsimile: (202) 741-5769;  toll free telephone: (877) 684-6448.</p>
