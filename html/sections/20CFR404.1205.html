                                Sec. 404.1205  Absolute coverage groups.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An absolute coverage group is a permanent grouping of  employees, e.g., all the employees of a city or town. It is a coverage  group for coverage and reporting purposes. When used for coverage  purposes, the term refers to groups of employees whose positions are not  under a retirement system. An absolute coverage group may include  positions which were formerly under a retirement system and, at the  State's option, employees who are in positions under a retirement system  but who are ineligible (see Sec. 404.1208) to become members of that  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What an absolute coverage group consists of. An absolute  coverage group consists of one of the following employee groups:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State employees performing services in connection with the  State's governmental functions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State employees performing services in connection with a single  proprietary function of the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employees of a State's political subdivision performing services  in connection with that subdivision's governmental functions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employees of a State's political subdivision performing services  in connection with a single proprietary function of the subdivision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Civilian employees of a State's National Guard units; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Individuals employed under an agreement between a State and the  U.S. Department of Agriculture as agricultural products inspectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designated coverage groups. A State may provide coverage for  designated (i.e., selected) absolute coverage groups of the State or a  political subdivision. When coverage is extended to these designated  groups, the State must specifically identify each group as a designated  absolute coverage group and furnish the effective date of coverage and  any optional exclusion(s) for each group. Where a State has provided  coverage to designated absolute coverage groups, the State may, by  modifying its agreement, extend that coverage to any absolute coverage  group in the State.</p>
