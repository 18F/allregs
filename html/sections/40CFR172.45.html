                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who must submit a Notification. Notwithstanding Sec. 172.3, any  person who plans to conduct small-scale testing of a type of microbial  pesticide identified in paragraph (c) of this section must submit a  Notification to EPA and obtain prior approval for either of the  following tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Small-scale tests that involve an intentional environmental  introduction of that microbial pesticide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Small-scale tests performed in a facility without adequate  containment and inactivation controls as provided in paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative to Notification. In lieu of a Notification, any  person required to submit a Notification under paragraph (a) of this  section may submit an application for an experimental use permit (EUP)  to EPA for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Small-scale testing that requires a Notification. As provided in  paragraph (a) of this section, and notwithstanding any other approval by  any governmental entity, EPA review and approval are required prior to  the initiation of any small-scale test involving either of the following  microbial pesticides:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Microbial pesticides whose pesticidal properties have been  imparted or enhanced by the introduction of genetic material that has  been deliberately modified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonindigenous microbial pesticides that have not been acted upon  by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (i.e., either by issuing or  denying a permit or determining that a permit is unnecessary; or a  permit is not pending with the USDA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Small-scale testing that does not require a Notification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Testing conducted with microbial pesticides identified in paragraph (c)  of this section, but made exempt pursuant to Sec. 172.52, does not  require a Notification. The following microbial pesticides (or classes  of pesticides) are exempt from the notification requirement in paragraph  (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Microbial pesticides resulting from deletions or rearrangements  within a single genome that are brought about by the introduction of  genetic material that has been deliberately modified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing conducted in a facility with adequate containment and  inactivation controls, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section,  does not require a Notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Selection and use of containment and inactivation controls. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Selection and use of containment and inactivation controls for a  particular microbial pesticide shall take into account the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Factors relevant to the microbial pesticide's ability to survive  in the environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Potential routes of release in air, solids, and liquids; in or  on waste materials and equipment; in or on people (including maintenance  and custodial personnel); and in or on other organisms such as insects  and rodents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Procedures for transfer of materials between facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Plans for routine or emergency clean-up and test termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, EPA will  presume that compliance with the containment provisions of the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) ``Guidelines for Research Involving  Recombinant DNA Molecules'' (51 FR 16958, May 7, 1986) constitutes  selection and use of adequate containment and inactivation controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The selection of containment and inactivation controls shall be  approved by an authorized official of the organization that is  conducting the test prior to commencement of the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records shall be developed and maintained describing the  selection and use of the containment and inactivation controls,  including contingency plans for emergency clean-up and test termination,  that will be used during the test. These records shall be available for  inspection at the test facility. In addition, these records shall be  submitted to EPA at EPA's request and within the time frame specified in  EPA's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subsequent to any EPA review of the containment/inactivation  controls selected under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, changes to the  controls necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects must be made  upon EPA request. Failure to comply with EPA's request shall result in  automatic revocation of the exemption from the requirement to submit a  Notification.</p>
