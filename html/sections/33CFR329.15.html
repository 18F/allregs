                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Findings and determinations should be made whenever a question arises regarding the navigability of a waterbody. Where no determination has been made, a report of findings will be prepared and forwarded to the division engineer, as described above. Inquiries may be answered by an interim reply which indicates that a final agency determination must be made by the division engineer. If a need develops for an energency determination, district engineers may act in reliance on a finding prepared as in section 329.14 of this part. The report of findings should then be forwarded to the division engineer on an expedited basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where determinations have been made by the division engineer, inquiries regarding the navigability of specific portions of waterbodies covered by these determinations may be answered as follows:</p><p class="depth0">This Department, in the administration of the laws enacted by Congress for the protection and preservation of the navigable waters of the United States, has determined that ------ (River) (Bay) (Lake, etc.) is a navigable water of the United States from ------ to ------. Actions which modify or otherwise affect those waters are subject to the jurisdiction of this Department, whether such actions occur within or outside the navigable areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specific inquiries regarding the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers can be answered only after a determination whether (1) the waters are navigable waters of the United States or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If not navigable, whether the proposed type of activity may nevertheless so affect the navigable waters of the United States that the assertion of regulatory jurisdiction is deemed necessary.</p>
