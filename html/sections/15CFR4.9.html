                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information obtained by the Department from a submitter will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business information means commercial or financial information, obtained by the Department from a submitter, which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person or entity outside the Federal Government from which the Department obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation of business information. A submitter of business information must use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4). These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to submitters. A component shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information whenever required under paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity under paragraph (f) of this section to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information. Such written notice shall be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means. The notice shall either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records containing the information. If notification of a large number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When notice is required. Notice shall be given to the submitter whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The submitter has designated the information in good faith as protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The component has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. A component shall allow a submitter seven working days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the written notice described in paragraph (d) of this section to provide the component with a statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement must identify any portions of the information the submitter requests to be withheld under FOIA exemption (b)(4), and describe how each qualifies for protection under the exemption: that is, why the information is a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice

within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds under the FOIA for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. If a component decides to disclose business information over a submitter's objection, the component shall give the submitter written notice via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement that the component intends to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The component determines that the information is exempt and will be withheld under a FOIA exemption, other than exemption (b)(4);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with Executive Order 12600; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component shall provide the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice to submitter of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the component shall promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Corresponding notice to requester. Whenever a component provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, the component shall notify the requester that the request is being processed under the provisions of this regulation and, as a consequence, there may be a delay in receiving a response. The notice to the requester will not include any of the specific information contained in the records being requested. Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the component shall notify the requester of such action and, as a consequence, there may be further delay in receiving a response.
