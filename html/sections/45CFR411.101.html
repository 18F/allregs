The care provider facility must implement the recommendations for improvement or must document its reason for not doing so in a written response. Both the report and response must be forwarded to ORR's Prevention of Sexual Abuse Coordinator. Care provider facilities also must collect accurate, uniform data for every reported incident of sexual abuse and sexual harassment using a standardized instrument and set of definitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Care provider facilities must conduct an annual review of all sexual abuse and sexual harassment investigations and resulting incident reviews to assess and improve sexual abuse and sexual harassment detection, prevention, and response efforts.
