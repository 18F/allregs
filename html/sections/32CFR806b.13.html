Requesters need not state why they  want access to their records. Verify the identity of the requester to  avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you verify identity will depend on  the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons may use a notary or an  unsworn declaration in the following format: ``I declare under penalty  of perjury (if outside the United States, add ``under the laws of the  United States of America'') that the foregoing is true and correct.  Executed on (date). (Signature).''</p>
