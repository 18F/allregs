The Board shall determine, upon its own motion or upon the  request of a state, financial institution, or other interested party,  whether the act and this part preempt state law relating to electronic  fund transfers, or dormancy, inactivity, or service fees, or expiration  dates in the case of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use  prepaid cards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards for determination. State law is inconsistent with the  requirements of the act and this part if it:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the federal  law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provides for consumer liability for unauthorized electronic  fund transfers that exceeds the limits imposed by the federal law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Allows longer time periods than the federal law for  investigating and correcting alleged errors, or does not require the  financial institution to credit the consumer's account during an error  investigation in accordance with Sec. 205.11(c)(2)(i); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requires initial disclosures, periodic statements, or receipts  that are different in content from those required by the federal law  except to the extent that the disclosures relate to consumer rights  granted by the state law and not by the federal law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State exemptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Any state may apply for an  exemption from the requirements of the act or this part for any class of  electronic fund transfers within the state. The Board shall grant an  exemption if it determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under state law the class of electronic fund transfers is  subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed by the  federal law; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is adequate provision for state enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. To assure that the federal and state courts continue  to have concurrent jurisdiction, and to aid in implementing the act:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No exemption shall extend to the civil liability provisions of  section 915 of the act; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the Board grants an exemption, the state law requirements  shall constitute the requirements of the federal law for purposes of  section 915 of the act, except for state law requirements not imposed by  the federal law.
