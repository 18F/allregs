                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and 1 CFR part 51.  Copies of WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998) may be obtained from the World  Intellectual Property Organization; 34 chemin des Colombettes; 1211  Geneva 20 Switzerland. Copies may also be inspected at the National  Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the  availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--federal-- regulations/ibr--locations.html. Nucleotides and amino acids are further  defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nucleotides: Nucleotides are intended to embrace only those  nucleotides that can be represented using the symbols set forth in WIPO  Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 1. Modifications, e.g.,  methylated bases, may be described as set forth in WIPO Standard ST.25  (1998), Appendix 2, Table 2, but shall not be shown explicitly in the  nucleotide sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amino acids: Amino acids are those L-amino acids commonly found  in naturally occurring proteins and are listed in WIPO Standard ST.25  (1998), Appendix 2, Table 3. Those amino acid sequences containing D- amino acids are not intended to be embraced by this definition. Any  amino acid sequence that contains post-translationally modified amino  acids may be described as the amino acid sequence that is initially  translated using the symbols shown in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998),  Appendix 2, Table 3 with the modified positions; e.g., hydroxylations or  glycosylations, being described as set forth in WIPO Standard ST.25  (1998), Appendix 2, Table 4, but these modifications shall not be shown  explicitly in the amino acid sequence. Any peptide or protein that can  be expressed as a sequence using the symbols in WIPO Standard ST.25  (1998), Appendix 2, Table 3 in conjunction with a description in the  Feature section to describe, for example, modified linkages, cross links  and end caps, non-peptidyl bonds, etc., is embraced by this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Patent applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide and/ or amino acid sequences, in accordance with the definition in paragraph  (a) of this section, shall, with regard to the manner in which the  nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are presented and described,  conform exclusively to the requirements of Sec. Sec.  1.821 through  1.825.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Patent applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide and/ or amino acid sequences must contain, as a separate part of the  disclosure, a paper or compact disc copy (see Sec.  1.52(e)) disclosing  the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences and associated information  using the symbols and format in accordance with the requirements of   Sec. Sec.  1.822 and 1.823. This paper or compact disc copy is referred  to elsewhere in this subpart as the ``Sequence Listing.'' Each sequence  disclosed must appear separately in the ``Sequence Listing.'' Each  sequence set forth in the ``Sequence Listing'' must be assigned a  separate sequence identifier. The sequence identifiers must begin with 1  and increase sequentially by integers. If no sequence is present for a  sequence identifier, the code ``000'' must be used in place of the  sequence. The response for the numeric identifier <160must  include the total number of SEQ ID NOs, whether followed by a sequence  or by the code ``000.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the description or claims of a patent application discuss  a sequence that is set forth in the ``Sequence Listing'' in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section, reference must be made to the  sequence by use of the sequence identifier, preceded by ``SEQ ID NO:''  in the text of the description or claims, even if the sequence is also  embedded in the text of the description or claims of the patent  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' referred to in paragraph (c)  of this section must also be submitted in computer readable form (CRF)  in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1.824. The computer  readable form must be a copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' and may not be  retained as a part of the patent application file. If the computer  readable form of a new application is to be identical with the computer  readable form of another application of the applicant on file in the  Office, reference may be made to the other application and computer  readable form in lieu of filing a duplicate computer readable form in  the new application if the computer readable form in the other  application was compliant with all of the requirements of this subpart.  The new application must be accompanied by a letter making such  reference to the other application and computer readable form, both of  which shall be completely identified. In the new application, applicant  must also request the use of the compliant computer readable ``Sequence  Listing'' that is already on file for the other application and must  state that the paper or compact disc copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' in  the new application is identical to the computer readable copy filed for  the other application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition to the paper or compact disc copy required by  paragraph (c) of this section and the computer readable form required by  paragraph (e) of this section, a statement that the ``Sequence Listing''  content of the paper or compact disc copy and the computer readable copy  are the same must be submitted with the computer readable form, e.g., a  statement that ``the sequence listing information recorded in computer  readable form is identical to the written (on paper or compact disc)  sequence listing.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If any of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this  section are not satisfied at the time of filing under 35 U.S.C. 111(a)  or at the time of entering the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371,  applicant will be notified and given a period of time within which to  comply with such requirements in order to prevent abandonment of the  application. Any submission in reply to a requirement under this  paragraph must be accompanied by a statement that the submission  includes no new matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If any of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this  section are not satisfied at the time of filing an international  application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which application  is to be searched by the United States International Searching Authority  or examined by the United States International Preliminary Examining  Authority, applicant will be sent a notice necessitating compliance with  the requirements within a prescribed time period. Any submission in  reply to a requirement under this paragraph must be accompanied by a  statement that the submission does not include matter which goes beyond  the disclosure in the international application as filed. If applicant  fails to timely provide the required computer readable form, the United  States International Searching Authority shall search only to the extent  that a meaningful search can be   performed without the computer readable form and the United States  International Preliminary Examining Authority shall examine only to the  extent that a meaningful examination can be performed without the  computer readable form.
