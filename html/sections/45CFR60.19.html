                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy on fees. The fees described in this section apply to all  requests for information from the NPDB. The amount of such fees will be  sufficient to recover the full costs of operating the NPDB. The actual  fees will be announced by the Secretary in periodic notices in the  Federal Register. However, for purposes of verification and dispute  resolution at the time the report is accepted, the NPDB will provide a  copy--at the time a report has been submitted, automatically, without a  request and free of charge, of the record to the health care  practitioner, entity, provider, or supplier who is the subject of the  report and to the reporter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for determining the fee. The amount of each fee will be  determined based on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and  fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs  (including materials and supplies, utilities, insurance, travel, and  rent and depreciation on land, buildings, and equipment),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agency management and supervisory costs,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Costs of enforcement, research, and establishment of regulations  and guidance,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use of electronic data processing equipment to collect and  maintain information--the actual cost of the service, including computer  search time, runs and printouts, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other direct or indirect costs related to the provision of  services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assessing and collecting fees. The Secretary will announce  through notice in the Federal Register from time to time the methods of  payment of NPDB fees. In determining these methods, the Secretary will  consider efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience for the NPDB users  and the Department. Methods may include: credit card, electronic fund  transfer, and other methods of electronic payment.</p>
