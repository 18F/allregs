                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (or, for taxable  years beginning before January 1, 1987, section 166(c)), any bad debt in  respect of a loan (whether or not such loan is an eligible loan) must be  charged to the reserve for losses on loans provided for by Sec. 1.585-1  for the taxable year in which the bad debt occurs. For such a year, any  recovery of a bad debt previously charged to the reserve account in  respect of a loan (whether or not such loan is an eligible loan) must be  credited to such reserve in the taxable year of recovery regardless of  whether such credit causes the reserve to exceed the permissible amount.  If, as a result of net recoveries during the taxable year, the reserve  balance exceeds the permissible amount, a taxpayer is not required to  report the excess as taxable income. In such a case, the excess over the  otherwise permissible amount in the reserve account precludes current  reasonable additions to the reserve and may affect future reasonable  additions. Recoveries of bad debts which were not charged to the reserve  shall not be credited to such reserve, but shall be treated as taxable  income subject to the provisions of section 111. No item other than a  loan as defined in Sec. 1.585-2 (e)(2) shall be charged to the reserve  for losses on loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4))))</em>  [T.D. 7532, 43 FR 3114, Jan. 23, 1978, as amended by T.D. 8513, 58 FR  68757, Dec. 29, 1993]</p>
