                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes procedures for measuring carbon monoxide (CO)  and nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions and determining fuel economy  on a cold day using the FTP test cycle (see Sec.  1066.801). The  following figure illustrates the test procedure:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.134</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Follow the exhaust emission measurement procedures specified in  Sec. Sec.  1066.410 through 1066.425 and Sec.  1066.815(d), subject to  the following exceptions and additional provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measure and control ambient conditions as specified in paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the vehicle's heater and defroster as specified in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Precondition and stabilize the vehicle as specified in  paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. Ensure that there is no  precipitation or dew on the vehicle before the emission test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For dynamometers that have independently heated bearings, start  the emission test within 20 minutes after warming up the dynamometer;  for other types of dynamometers, start the emission test within 10  minutes after warming up the dynamometer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adjust the dynamometer to simulate vehicle operation on the road  at -7 [deg]C. Base this adjustment on the road-load force profile at -7  [deg]C, or on a 10 percent decrease in the target coastdown time used  for FTP testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Analyze samples for NMHC, CO, and CO2. You do not  need to analyze samples for other pollutants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maintain ambient conditions as follows instead of following the  specifications in subpart E of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ambient temperature for emission tests. Measure and record  ambient temperature in the test cell at least once every 60 seconds  during the sampling period. The temperature must be (-7.0 1.7) [deg]C at the start of the test and average  temperature must be (-7.0 2.8) [deg]C during the  test. Instantaneous temperature values may be above -4.0 [deg]C or below  -9.0 [deg]C, but not for more than 3 minutes at a time during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ambient temperature for preconditioning. Instantaneous ambient  temperature values may be above -4.0 [deg]C or below -9.0 [deg]C but not  for more than 3 minutes at a time during the preconditioning period. At  no time may the ambient temperatures be below -12.0 [deg]C or above -1.0  [deg]C. The average ambient temperature during preconditioning must be  (-7.0 2.8) [deg]C. You may precondition vehicles  at temperatures above -7.0 [deg]C or with a temperature tolerance  greater than that described in this section (or both) if you determine  that this will not cause NMHC, CO, or CO2 emissions to  decrease; if you modify the temperature specifications for vehicle  preconditioning, adjust the procedures described in this section  appropriately for your testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ambient humidity. Maintain humidity low enough to prevent  condensation on the dynamometer rolls during testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Heater and defroster. During the test, operate the vehicle's  interior climate control system with the heat on and set to primarily  defrost the front window. Turn air conditioning off. You may not use any  supplemental auxiliary heat during this testing. You may set the heater  to any temperature and fan setting during vehicle preconditioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual control. Unless you rely on automatic control as  specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, take the following steps  to control heater settings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set the climate control system as follows before the first  acceleration (t=20 s), or before starting the vehicle if the climate  control system allows it:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Temperature. Set controls to maximum heat. For automatic control  systems running in manual mode, set the heater control to 72 [deg]F or  higher.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fan speed. Set the fan speed to full off or the lowest available  speed if a full off position is not available.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Airflow direction. Direct airflow to the front window (window  defrost mode).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Air source. If independently controllable, set the system to  draw in outside air.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the second idle of the test cycle, which occurs 125 seconds  after the start of the test, set the fan speed to maximum. Complete by  130 seconds after the start of the test. Leave temperature and air  source settings unchanged.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the sixth idle of the test interval, which occurs at the  deceleration to zero miles per hour 505 seconds after the start of the  test, set the fan speed to the lowest setting that maintains air flow.  Complete these changes by 510 seconds after the start of the test. You  may use different vent and fan speed settings for the remainder of the  test. Leave the temperature and air source settings unchanged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Automatic control. For vehicles with automatic control systems  running in automatic mode, set the temperature to 72 [deg]F and the air  flow control to the front window defrost mode for the whole test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiple-zone systems. For vehicles that have separate driver  and passenger controls or separate front and rear controls, you must set  all temperature and fan controls as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and  (2) of this section, except that rear controls need not be set to  defrost the front window.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alternative test procedures. We may approve the use of other  settings under 40 CFR 86.1840 if a vehicle's climate control system is  not compatible with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Take the following steps to prepare and precondition vehicles  for testing under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare the vehicle as described in Sec.  1066.810(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fill the fuel tank to approximately 40% of the manufacturer's  nominal fuel tank capacity with the appropriate test fuel for cold  temperature testing as specified 40 CFR Part 1065, subpart H. The  temperature of the dispensed test fuel must be at or below 15.5 [deg]C.  If the leftover fuel in the fuel tank before the refueling event does  not meet these specifications, drain the fuel tank before refueling. You  may operate the vehicle prior to the preconditioning drive to eliminate  fuel effects on adaptive memory systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may start the preconditioning drive once the fuel in the  fuel tank reaches (12.6 to -1.4) [deg]C. Precondition the vehicle as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Push or drive the vehicle onto the dynamometer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operate the vehicle over one UDDS. You may perform additional  vehicle preconditioning with repeated driving over the UDDS, subject to  our advance approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Turn off the test vehicle and any cooling fans within 5  minutes after completing the preconditioning drive. Ambient temperature  must be between (-12.0 and -1.0) [deg]C in the 5 minutes following the  preconditioning drive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Do not manually purge or load the evaporative canister.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>. If you move a stabilized vehicle through a warm area when  transporting it to the dynamometer for testing, you must restabilize the  vehicle by holding it at an ambient temperature within the range  specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for at least six times as  long as the vehicle was exposed to warmer temperatures. Use one of the  following methods to reach a stabilized condition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cold storage. Measure and record ambient temperature in the test  cell at least once every 60 seconds during the ambient cold soak period.  These ambient temperatures may be above -4.0 [deg]C or below -9.0  [deg]C, but not for more than 3 minutes at a time. Use measured values  to calculate an hourly average temperature. Each hourly average  temperature must be (-7.0 [deg]C 2.8) [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forced-cooling or warming. Position fans to blow temperature- controlled air onto the vehicle to stabilize the vehicle at the  specified temperatures for emission testing. Position fans to target the  vehicle's drive train, engine block, and radiator rather than the oil  pan. You may not place fans under the vehicle. You may consider the  vehicle to be stabilized at the test temperature when the bulk oil  temperature reaches (-8.7 to -5.3) [deg]C; measure oil temperature at  one or more points away from the side or bottom surfaces of the oil pan.  Each oil temperature measurement must be within the specified range  before stabilization is complete. Once the vehicle reaches this  stabilized condition, cold soak the vehicle within the stabilized  temperature range for at least one hour before starting the emission  test. During this time, keep the ambient temperature within the range  specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  [79 FR 23823, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9122, Feb. 19, 2015]</p>
