                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The powerplant limitations prescribed in this section must be established so that they do not exceed the corresponding limits for which the engines or propellers are type certificated. In addition, other powerplant limitations used in determining compliance with this part must be established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Takeoff operation. The powerplant takeoff operation must be limited by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum rotational speed (rpm);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable manifold pressure (for reciprocating engines);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum allowable gas temperature (for turbine engines);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time limit for the use of the power or thrust corresponding to the limitations established in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The maximum allowable cylinder head (as applicable), liquid coolant and oil temperatures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuous operation. The continuous operation must be limited by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum rotational speed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable manifold pressure (for reciprocating engines);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum allowable gas temperature (for turbine engines); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The maximum allowable cylinder head, oil, and liquid coolant temperatures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel grade or designation. The minimum fuel grade (for reciprocating engines), or fuel designation (for turbine engines), must be established so that it is not less than that required for the operation of the engines within the limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ambient temperature. For all airplanes except reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, ambient temperature limitations (including limitations for winterization installations if applicable) must be established as the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature at which compliance with the cooling provisions of Sec. Sec. 23.1041 through 23.1047 is shown.
