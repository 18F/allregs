                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies shall ensure that contractors comply with the reporting  requirements of 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First- Tier Subcontract Awards. Agencies shall review contractor reports on a  quarterly basis to ensure the information is consistent with contract  information. The agency is not required to address data for which the  agency would not normally have supporting information, such as the  compensation information required of contractors and first-tier  subcontractors. However, the agency shall inform the contractor of any  inconsistencies with the contract information and require that the  contractor correct the report, or provide a reasonable explanation as to  why it believes the information is correct. Agencies may review the  reports at http://www.fsrs.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When contracting officers report the contract action to the  Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) in accordance with FAR subpart  4.6, certain data will then pre-populate from FPDS, to assist  contractors in completing and submitting their reports. If data  originating from FPDS is found by the contractor to be in error when the  contractor completes the subcontract report, the contractor should  notify the Government contracting officer, who is responsible for  correcting the data in FPDS. Contracts reported using the generic DUNS  number allowed at FAR 4.605(c)(2) will interfere with the contractor's  ability to comply with this reporting requirement, because the data will  not pre-populate from FPDS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the contractor fails to comply with the reporting  requirements, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate  contractual remedies. In addition, the contracting officer shall make  the contractor's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a  part of the contractor's performance information under Subpart 42.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There is a reporting exception in 52.204-10(g) for contractors  and subcontractors who had gross income in the previous tax year under  $300,000.
