                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Apply criteria of adverse effect. In consultation with the SHPO/ THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches  religious and cultural significance to identified historic properties,  the agency official shall apply the criteria of adverse effect to  historic properties within the area of potential effects. The agency  official shall consider any views concerning such effects which have  been provided by consulting parties and the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria of adverse effect. An adverse effect is found when an  undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the  characteristics of a   historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the  National Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the  property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,  or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying  characteristics of a historic property, including those that may have  been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the property's  eligibility for the National Register. Adverse effects may include  reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur  later in time, be farther removed in distance or be cumulative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of adverse effects. Adverse effects on historic  properties include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the  property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alteration of a property, including restoration,  rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material  remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent  with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties  (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Removal of the property from its historic location;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Change of the character of the property's use or of physical  features within the property's setting that contribute to its historic  significance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Introduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that  diminish the integrity of the property's significant historic features;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except  where such neglect and deterioration are recognized qualities of a  property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or  Native Hawaiian organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of Federal ownership  or control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or  conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property's historic  significance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Phased application of criteria. Where alternatives under  consideration consist of corridors or large land areas, or where access  to properties is restricted, the agency official may use a phased  process in applying the criteria of adverse effect consistent with  phased identification and evaluation efforts conducted pursuant to Sec.  800.4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Finding of no adverse effect. The agency official, in  consultation with the SHPO/THPO, may propose a finding of no adverse  effect when the undertaking's effects do not meet the criteria of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the undertaking is modified or  conditions are imposed, such as the subsequent review of plans for  rehabilitation by the SHPO/THPO to ensure consistency with the  Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR  part 68) and applicable guidelines, to avoid adverse effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consulting party review. If the agency official proposes a  finding of no adverse effect, the agency official shall notify all  consulting parties of the finding and provide them with the  documentation specified in Sec. 800.11(e). The SHPO/THPO shall have 30  days from receipt to review the finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disagreement with finding. (i) If within the 30 day review  period the SHPO/THPO or any consulting party notifies the agency  official in writing that it disagrees with the finding and specifies the  reasons for the disagreement in the notification, the agency official  shall either consult with the party to resolve the disagreement, or  request the Council to review the finding pursuant to paragraphs  (c)(3)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The agency official shall  include with such request the documentation specified in Sec.  800.11(e). The agency official shall also concurrently notify all  consulting parties that such a submission has been made and make the  submission documentation available to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an  agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The agency official should seek the concurrence of any Indian  tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that has made known to the agency  official that it attaches religious and cultural significance to a  historic property subject to the finding. If such Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization disagrees with the finding, it may within the 30  day review period specify the reasons for disagreeing with the finding  and request the Council to review and object to the finding pursuant to  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Council review of findings. (i) When a finding is submitted to  the Council pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, the Council  shall review the finding and provide the agency official and, if the  Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with  its opinion as to whether the adverse effect criteria have been  correctly applied. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head  of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part.  The Council will provide its opinion within 15 days of receiving the  documented finding from the agency official. The Council at its  discretion may extend that time period for 15 days, in which case it  shall notify the agency of such extension prior to the end of the  initial 15 day period. If the Council does not respond within the  applicable time period, the agency official's responsibilities under  section 106 are fulfilled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the  agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the  Council's opinion in reaching a final decision on the finding.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency  official or the head of the agency) shall prepare a summary of the  decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of  consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council,  the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties. The head of the agency may  delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior  policy official. If the agency official's initial finding will be  revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the  revised finding. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the  initial finding of no adverse effect, once the summary of the decision  has been sent to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties,  the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Council shall retain a record of agency responses to Council  opinions on their findings of no adverse effects. The Council shall make  this information available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Results of assessment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No adverse effect. The agency  official shall maintain a record of the finding and provide information  on the finding to the public on request, consistent with the  confidentiality provisions of Sec. 800.11(c). Implementation of the  undertaking in accordance with the finding as documented fulfills the  agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and this part. If  the agency official will not conduct the undertaking as proposed in the  finding, the agency official shall reopen consultation under paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adverse effect. If an adverse effect is found, the agency  official shall consult further to resolve the adverse effect pursuant to  Sec. 800.6.  [65 FR 77725, Dec. 12, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 40553, July 6, 2004]</p>
