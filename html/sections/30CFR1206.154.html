The net output of gas plant products allocable to each lease will be determined by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant product content of the gas, and dividing the arithmetical product thus obtained by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the arithmetic quotient obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A lessee may request ONRR approval of other methods for determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease. If approved, such method will be applicable to all gas production from Federal leases that is processed in the same plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas that may be sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point will not be subject to royalty provided that such loss is determined to have been unavoidable by BLM or BSEE, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas that may be sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point will not be subject to royalty provided that such loss is determined to have been unavoidable by BLM or BSEE, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and Sec. 1202.151(c), royalties are due on 100 percent of the volume determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. There can be no reduction in that determined volume for actual losses after the quantity basis has been determined or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products as provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. There can be no deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products to compensate for actual losses after the quantity basis has been determined, or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place.
