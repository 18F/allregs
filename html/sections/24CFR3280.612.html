                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Water system. All water piping in the water distribution system  shall be subjected to a pressure test. The test shall be made by  subjecting the system to air or water at 100 psi for 15 minutes without  loss of pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drainage and vent system and plumbing fixtures. The waste and  vent system shall be tested by one of the three following alternate  methods for evidence or indication of leakage:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Water test. Before plumbing fixtures are connected, all of the  openings into the piping shall be plugged and the entire piping system  subjected to a static water test for 15 minutes by filling it with water  to the top of the highest vent opening. There shall be no evidence of  leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Air test. After all fixtures have been installed, the traps  filled with water, and the remaining openings securely plugged, the  entire system shall be subjected to a 2-inch (manometer) water column  air pressure test. If the system loses pressure, leaks may be located  with smoke pumped into the system, or with soap suds spread on the  exterior of the piping (Bubble test).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flood level test. The manufactured home shall be in a level  position, all fixtures shall be connected, and the entire system shall  be filled with water to the rim of the water closet bowl. (Tub and  shower drains shall be plugged). After all trapped air has been  released, the test shall be sustained for not less than 15 minutes  without evidence of leaks. Then the system shall be unplugged and  emptied. The waste piping above the level of the water closet bowl shall  then be tested and show no indication of leakage when the high fixtures  are filled with water and emptied simultaneously to obtain the maximum  possible flow in the drain piping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fixture test. The plumbing fixtures and connections shall be  subjected to a flow test by filling them with water and checking for  leaks and retarded flow while they are being emptied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Shower compartments. Shower compartments and receptors shall be  tested for leaks prior to being covered by finish material. Each pan  shall be filled with water to the top of the dam for not less than 15  minutes without evidence of leakage.
