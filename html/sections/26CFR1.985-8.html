REG. Sec. 1.985-8.'' For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), an affected taxpayer shall be in the case where the QBU is: a QBU of an individual U.S. resident (as a result of the activities of such individual), the individual; a QBU branch of a U.S. corporation, the corporation; a controlled foreign corporation (as described in section 957)(or QBU branch thereof), each United States shareholder (as described in section 951(b)); a partnership, each partner separately; a noncontrolled section 902 corporation

Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, a legacy currency denominated section 988 transaction (determined after applying section 988(d)) outstanding on the last day of the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change shall continue to be treated as a section 988 transaction after the change and the principles of section 988 shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, a legacy currency denominated section 988 transaction (determined after applying section 988(d)) outstanding on the last day of the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change shall continue to be treated as a section 988 transaction after the change and the principles of section 988 shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (c)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a calendar year QBU on the cash method of accounting, uses the deutschmark as its functional currency. X is not described in section 1281(b). On July 1, 1998, X converts 10,000 deutschmarks (DM) into Dutch guilders (fl) at the spot rate of fl1 = DM1 and loans the 10,000 guilders to Y (an unrelated party) for one year at a rate of 10% with principal and interest to be paid on June 30, 1999. On January 1, 1999, X changes its functional currency to the euro pursuant to this section. Assume that the euro/deutschmark conversion rate is set by the European Council at [euro]1= DM2. Assume further that the euro/guilder conversion rate is set at [euro]1 = fl2.25. Accordingly, under the terms of the note, on June 30, 1999, X will receive [euro]4444.44 (fl10,000/2.25) of principal and [euro]444.44 (fl1,000/2.25) of interest. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), X will realize an exchange loss on the principal computed under the principles of Sec. 1.988-2(b)(5). For this purpose, the exchange rate used under Sec. 1.988-2(b)(5)(i) shall be the guilder/euro conversion rate. The amount under Sec. 1.988-2(b)(5)(ii) is determined by translating the fl10,000 at the guilder/deutschmark spot rate on July 1, 1998, and translating that deutschmark amount into euros at the deutschmark/euro conversion rate. Thus, X will compute an exchange loss for 1999 of [euro]555.56 determined as follows: [[euro]4444.44 (fl10,000/2.25)-5000 ((fl10,000/1)/2) = -[euro]555.56]. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), the character and source of the loss are determined pursuant to section 988 and regulations thereunder. Because X uses the cash method of accounting for the interest on this debt instrument, X does not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of that interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar year QBU on the accrual method of accounting, uses the deutschmark as its functional currency. On February 1, 1998, X converts 12,000 deutschmarks into Dutch guilders at the spot rate of fl1 = DM1 and loans the 12,000 guilders to Y (an unrelated party) for one year at a rate of 10% with principal and interest to be paid on January 31, 1999. In addition, assume the average rate (deutschmark/guilder) for the period from February 1, 1998, through December 31, 1998 is fl1.07 = DM1. Pursuant to Sec. 1.988-2(b)(2)(ii)(C), X will accrue eleven months of interest on the note and recognize interest income of DM1028.04 (fl1100/1.07) in the 1998 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On January 1, 1999, the euro will replace the deutschmark as the national currency of Germany pursuant to the Treaty on European Union signed February 7, 1992. Assume that on January 1, 1999, X changes its functional currency to the euro pursuant to this section. Assume that the euro/deutschmark conversion rate is set by the European Council at [euro]1 = DM2. Assume further that the euro/guilder conversion rate is set at [euro]1 = fl2.25. In 1999, X will accrue one month of interest equal to [euro]44.44 (fl100/2.25). On January 31, 1999, pursuant to the note, X will receive interest denominated in euros of [euro]533.33 (fl1200/2.25). Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), X will realize an exchange loss in the 1999 taxable year with respect to accrued interest computed under the principles of Sec. 1.988-2(b)(3). For this purpose, the exchange rate used under Sec. 1.988-2(b)(3)(i) is the guilder/euro conversion rate and the exchange rate used under Sec. 1.988-2(b)(3)(ii) is the deutschmark/euro conversion rate. Thus, with respect to the interest accrued in 1998, X will realize exchange loss of [euro]25.13 under Sec. 1.988-2(b)(3) as follows: [[euro]488.89 (fl1100/2.25) - [euro]514.02 (DM1028.04/2) = -[euro]25.13]. With respect to the one month of interest accrued in 1999, X will realize no exchange gain or loss

since the exchange rate when the interest accrued and the spot rate on the payment date are the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> X will realize exchange loss of [euro]666.67 on repayment of the loan principal computed in the same manner as in Example 1 [[euro]5333.33 (fl12,000/2.25) - [euro]6000 fl12,000/1)/2)]. The losses with respect to accrued interest and principal are characterized and sourced under the rules of section 988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for legacy nonfunctional currency. The QBU shall realize or otherwise take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to nonfunctional currency (as described in section 988(c)(1)(C)(ii)) that is denominated in a legacy currency as if the currency were disposed of on the last day of the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change. The character and source of the gain or loss are determined under section 988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Legacy currency denominated accounts receivable and payable--(A) In general. A QBU may elect to realize or otherwise take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to a legacy currency denominated item described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) as if the item were terminated on the last day of the taxable year ending prior to the year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A QBU may elect to realize or otherwise take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to a legacy currency denominated item described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) as if the item were terminated on the last day of the taxable year ending prior to the year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Time and manner of election. With respect to a QBU that makes an election described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, an affected taxpayer (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) shall attach a statement to its tax return for the taxable year ending immediately prior to the year of change which includes the following: ``TAXPAYER CERTIFIES THAT A QBU OF THE TAXPAYER HAS ELECTED TO REALIZE CURRENCY GAIN OR LOSS ON LEGACY CURRENCY DENOMINATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE UPON CHANGE OF FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TO THE EURO.'' A QBU making the election must do so for all legacy currency denominated items described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments when a branch changes its functional currency to the euro--(i) Branch changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which taxpayer's functional currency is other than the euro. If a branch changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the taxpayer's functional currency is other than the euro, the branch's euro equity pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the equity pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the basis pool is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Branch changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which taxpayer's functional currency is other than the euro. If a branch changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the taxpayer's functional currency is other than the euro, the branch's euro equity pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the equity pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the basis pool is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Branch changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which taxpayer's functional currency is the euro. If a branch changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the taxpayer's functional currency is the euro, the taxpayer shall realize gain or loss attributable to the branch's equity pool under the principles of section 987, computed as if the branch terminated on the last day prior to the year of change. Adjustments under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) shall be taken into account by the taxpayer ratably over four taxable years beginning with the taxable year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjustments to a branch's accounts when a taxpayer changes to the euro--(i) Taxpayer changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which a branch's functional currency is other than the euro. If a taxpayer changes its functional currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the functional currency of a branch of the taxpayer is other than the euro, the basis pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the basis pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the equity pool is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which a branch's functional currency is other than the euro. If a taxpayer changes its functional currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the functional currency of a branch of the taxpayer is other than the euro, the basis pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the basis pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the equity pool is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxpayer changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which a branch's functional currency is the euro. If a taxpayer changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the functional currency of a branch of the taxpayer is the euro, the taxpayer shall take into account gain or loss as determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Additional adjustments that are necessary when a corporation changes its functional currency to the euro. The

amount of a corporation's euro currency earnings and profits and the amount of its euro paid-in capital shall equal the product of the legacy currency amounts of these items multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. The foreign income taxes and accumulated profits or deficits in accumulated profits of a foreign corporation that were maintained in foreign currency for purposes of section 902 and that are attributable to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 1987, also shall be translated into the euro at the conversion rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of legacy currency section 988 transactions with respect to a QBU that has the euro as its functional currency--(1) In general. This Sec. 1.985-8(d) applies to a QBU that has the euro as its functional currency and that holds a section 988 transaction denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency that is substituted by the euro. For example, this paragraph (d) will apply to a German QBU with the euro as its functional currency if the QBU is holding Country X currency or other section 988 transactions denominated in such currency on the day in the year 2005 when the euro is substituted for the Country X currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This Sec. 1.985-8(d) applies to a QBU that has the euro as its functional currency and that holds a section 988 transaction denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency that is substituted by the euro. For example, this paragraph (d) will apply to a German QBU with the euro as its functional currency if the QBU is holding Country X currency or other section 988 transactions denominated in such currency on the day in the year 2005 when the euro is substituted for the Country X currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply. With respect to a QBU described in paragraph (d) of this section, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply. For example, if a German QBU with the euro as its functional currency is holding a Country X currency denominated debt instrument on the day in the year 2005 when the euro is substituted for the Country X currency, the instrument shall continue to be treated as a section 988 transaction pursuant to the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. However, if such QBU holds Country X currency, the QBU shall take into account any unrealized exchange gain or loss pursuant to the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section as if the currency was disposed of on the day prior to the day the euro is substituted for the Country X currency. Similarly, if the QBU makes an election under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, the QBU shall take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to a legacy currency denominated item described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) as if the item were terminated on the day prior to the day the euro is substituted for the Country X currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section applies to tax years ending after July 29, 1998.
