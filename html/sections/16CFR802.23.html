                                Sec. 802.23  Amended or renewed tender offers.

                            <p class="depth0">Whenever a tender offer is amended or renewed after notification has  been filed by the offeror, no new notification shall be required, and  the running of the waiting period shall be unaffected, except as  follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the number of voting securities to be acquired pursuant to  the offer is increased such that a greater notification threshold would  be met or exceeded, only the acquiring person need again file  notification, but a new waiting period must be observed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>, the waiting period shall expire on the 15th day  after the date of receipt (determined in accordance with Sec.  803.10(c)) of the amended tender offer, or on the 30th day after filing  notification, whichever is earlier; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c))</em> of the amended tender offer, or on the 30th day after filing  notification, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2">Examples: 1. Assume that corporation A makes a tender offer for 20  percent of the voting securities of corporation B and that ``A'' files  notification. Under this section, if A subsequently amends its tender  offer only as to the amount of consideration offered, the waiting period  so commenced is not affected, and no new notification need be filed.</p><p class="depth2">2. In the previous example, assume that A makes an amended tender  offer for 27 percent of the voting securities of B, valued at greater  than $1 billion. Since a new notification threshold will be crossed,  this section requires that ``A'' must again file notification and  observe a new waiting period. Paragraph (a) of this section, however,  provides that ``B'' need not file notification again.</p><p class="depth2">3. Assume that ``A'' makes a tender offer for shares of corporation  B. ``A'' includes its voting securities as part of the consideration.  ``A'' files notification. Five days later, ``A'' changes its tender  offer to a cash tender offer, and on the same day files copies of its  amended tender offer with the offices designated in Sec. 803.10(c).  Under paragraph (b) of   this section, the waiting period expires (unless extended or terminated)  15 days after the receipt of the amended offer (on the 20th day after  filing notification), since that occurs earlier than the expiration of  the original waiting period (which would occur on the 30th day after  filing).</p><p class="depth2">4. Assume that ``A'' makes a cash tender offer for shares of  corporation B and files notification. Six days later, ``A'' amends the  tender offer and adds voting securities as consideration, and on the  same day files copies of the amended tender offer with the offices  designated in Sec. 803.10(c). Under paragraph (c) of this section, the  waiting period expires (unless extended or terminated) on the 30th day  following the date of filing of notification (determined under Sec.  803.10(c)), since that occurs later than the 15th day after receipt of  the amended tender offer (which would occur on the 21st day).
