A QHP issuer must be accredited  within the   timeframe established by the Exchange in accordance with Sec. 155.1045  of this subchapter. The QHP issuer must maintain accreditation so long  as the QHP issuer offers QHPs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accreditation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recognition of accrediting entity by HHS--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Application. An accrediting entity may apply to HHS for recognition. An  application must include the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)  of this section and demonstrate, in a concise and organized fashion how  the accrediting entity meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and  (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proposed notice. Within 60 days of receiving a complete  application as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, HHS  will publish a notice in the Federal Register identifying the  accrediting entity making the request, summarizing HHS's analysis of  whether the accrediting entity meets the criteria described in  paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, and providing no less than a  30-day public comment period about whether HHS should recognize the  accrediting entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Final notice. After the close of the comment period described  in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, HHS will notify the public in  the Federal Register of the names of the accrediting entities recognized  and those not recognized as accrediting entities by the Secretary of HHS  to provide accreditation of QHPs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other recognition. Upon completion of conditions listed in  paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, HHS recognized, and  provided notice to the public in the Federal Register, the National  Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and URAC as accrediting entities  by the Secretary of HHS to provide accreditation of QHPs meeting the  requirement of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scope of accreditation.

Recognized accrediting entities must  provide accreditation at the Exchange product type level unless the  product type level of accreditation is not methodologically sound. In  such cases, the recognized accrediting entity must demonstrate that the  Exchange product type level accreditation is not methodologically sound  as a condition of the Exchange granting an exception to authorize  accreditation at an aggregated level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Network adequacy. The network adequacy standards for  accreditation used by the recognized accrediting entities must, at a  minimum, be consistent with the general requirements for network  adequacy for QHP issuers codified in Sec. 156.230(a)(2) and (a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methodological and scoring criteria for accreditation.
