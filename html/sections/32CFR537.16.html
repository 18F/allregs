Claims for salvage services are based upon labor cost, per diem rates for the use of salvage vessels and other equipment, and repair or replacement costs for materials and equipment damaged or lost during the salvage operation. The sum claimed is usually intended to compensate the United States for operational costs only, reserving, however, the government's right to assert a claim on a salvage bonus basis in accordance with commercial practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The United States has three years from the date a maritime claim accrues under this section to file suit against the responsible party or parties.</p>
