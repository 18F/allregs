                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each new on-track roadway maintenance machine shall be equipped  with:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A horn or other audible warning device that produces a sound  loud enough to be heard by roadway workers and other machine operators  within the immediate work area. The triggering mechanism for the device  shall be clearly identifiable and within easy reach of the machine  operator; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An automatic change-of-direction alarm which provides an audible  signal that is at least three seconds long and is distinguishable from  the surrounding noise. Change of direction alarms may be interrupted by  the machine operator when operating the machine in the work mode if the  function of the machine would result in a constant, or almost constant,  sounding of the device. In any action brought by FRA to enforce the  change-of-direction alarm requirement, the employer shall have the  burden of proving that use of the change-of-direction alarm in a  particular work function would cause a constant, or almost constant,  sounding of the device.</p>
