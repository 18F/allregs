An insured state nonmember bank controlling or holding an interest in a financial subsidiary under section 46(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831w) must meet and continue to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section as long as the insured state nonmember bank holds the financial subsidiary and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclose and continue to disclose the capital separation required in paragraph (a)(3) in any published financial statements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply and continue to comply with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c-1) as if the subsidiary were a financial subsidiary of a national bank; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comply and continue to comply with the financial and operational standards provided by section 5136A(d) of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 24A(d)), unless otherwise determined by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Securities underwriting.

and prospective customers of the financial subsidiary that the financial subsidiary is a separate organization from the insured state nonmember bank and that the insured state nonmember bank is not responsible for and does not guarantee the obligations of the financial subsidiary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bank must adopt policies and procedures, including appropriate limits on exposure, to govern its participation in financing transactions underwritten by its financial subsidiary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The bank must not express an opinion on the value or the advisability of the purchase or sale of securities underwritten or dealt in by its financial subsidiary unless the bank notifies the customer that the entity underwriting, making a market, distributing or dealing in the securities is a financial subsidiary of the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applications for exceptions to certain requirements.

The FDIC may take any appropriate action or impose any limitations, including requiring that the insured state nonmember bank to divest control of any such financial subsidiary, on the conduct or activities of the insured state nonmember bank or any financial subsidiary of the insured state bank that fails to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meet the requirements listed in Sec. 362.18(a) and (b) at the time that any new section 46 activity is commenced or control of a financial subsidiary is acquired by an insured state nonmember bank; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Meet and continue to meet the requirements listed in Sec. 362.18(c) and (d), as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Coordination with section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act--(1) Continuing authority under section 24.

the section 24 order or regulation approving the activity as well as other applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuing authority under section 24(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
