                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A permit may be issued under this section  to authorize removal or relocation of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An active or inactive nest where necessary to alleviate a safety  emergency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An inactive eagle nest when the removal is necessary to ensure  public health and safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An inactive nest that is built on a human-engineered structure  and creates a functional hazard that renders the structure inoperable  for its intended use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An inactive nest, provided the take is necessary to protect an  interest in a particular locality and the activity necessitating the  take or the mitigation for the take will, with reasonable certainty,  provide a clear and substantial benefit to eagles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where practicable and biologically warranted, the permit may  require a nest to be relocated, or a substitute nest provided, in a  suitable site within the same territory to provide a viable nesting  option for eagles within that territory, unless such relocation would  create a threat to safety. However, we may issue permits to remove nests  that we determine cannot or should not be relocated. The permit may  authorize take of eggs or nestlings if present. The permit may also  authorize the take of adult eagles (e.g., disturbance or capture)  associated with the removal or relocation of the nest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A programmatic permit may be issued under this section to cover  multiple nest takes over a period of up to 5 years, provided the  permittee complies with comprehensive measures that are developed in  coordination with the Service, designed to reduce take to the maximum  degree technically achievable, and specified as conditions of the  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This permit does not authorize intentional, lethal take of  eagles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for take that is necessary to alleviate  an immediate threat to human or eagle safety, only inactive eagle nests  may be taken under this permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an active nest must be removed under this permit, any take  of nestlings or eggs must be conducted by a Service-approved, qualified,  and permitted agent, and all nestlings and viable eggs must be  immediately transported to foster/recipient nests or a rehabilitation  facility permitted to care for eagles, as directed by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Possession of the nest for any purpose other than removal or  relocation is prohibited without a separate permit issued under this  part authorizing such possession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must submit a report consisting of a summary of the  activities conducted under the permit to the Service within 30 days  after the permitted take occurs, except that for programmatic permits,  you must report each nest removal within 10 days after the take and  submit an annual report by January 31 containing all the information  required in Form 3-202-16 for activities conducted during the preceding  calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may be required to monitor the area and report whether  eagles attempt to build or occupy another nest at another site in the  vicinity for the duration specified in the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You may be required under the terms of the permit to harass  eagles from the area following the nest removal when the Service  determines it is necessary to prevent eagles from re-nesting in the  vicinity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You must comply with all avoidance, minimization, or other  mitigation measures determined by the Director as reasonable and  specified in the terms of your permit to compensate for the detrimental  effects, including indirect effects, of the permitted activity on--and  for permits issued under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, to  provide a net benefit to--the regional eagle population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Service may amend or revoke a programmatic permit issued  under this section if new information indicates that revised permit  conditions are necessary, or that suspension or revocation is necessary,  to safeguard local or regional eagle populations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 13.26 of this subchapter,  you remain responsible for all outstanding monitoring requirements and  mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that  occurs prior to cancellation, expiration, suspension, or revocation of  the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The authorization granted by permits issued under this section  is not valid unless you are in compliance with all Federal, tribal,  State, and local laws and regulations applicable to take of eagles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applying for a permit to take eagle nests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the take is  necessary to address an immediate threat to human or eagle safety,  contact your local U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Migratory  Bird Permit Office (http://www.fws.gov/permits/mbpermits/addresses.html)  at the earliest possible opportunity to inform the Service of the  emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your application must consist of a completed application Form 3- 200-72 and all required attachments. Send applications to the Regional  Director of the Region in which the disturbance would occur--Attention:  Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find the current addresses for the  Regional Directors in Sec. 2.2 of subchapter A of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation of applications. In determining whether to issue a  permit, we will evaluate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The direct and indirect effects of the take and required  mitigation, together with the cumulative effects of other permitted take  and additional factors affecting eagle populations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether there is a practicable alternative to nest removal that  will protect the interest to be served;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether issuing the permit would preclude the Service from  authorizing another take necessary to protect an interest of higher  priority, as set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For take that is not necessary to alleviate an immediate safety  emergency, whether suitable nesting and   foraging habitat is available to accommodate eagles displaced by the  nest removal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any additional factors that may be relevant to our decision  whether to issue the permit, including, but not limited to, the cultural  significance of a local eagle population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required determinations. Before issuing a permit under this  section, we must find that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The direct and indirect effects of the take and required  mitigation, together with the cumulative effects of other permitted take  and additional factors affecting eagle populations, are compatible with  the preservation of the bald eagle or the golden eagle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For inactive nests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The take is necessary to ensure public health and safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nest is built on a human-engineered structure and creates a  functional hazard that renders the structure inoperable for its intended  use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The take is necessary to protect a legitimate interest in a  particular locality, and the activity necessitating the take or the  mitigation for the take will, with reasonable certainty, provide a clear  and substantial benefit to eagles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For active nests, the take is necessary to alleviate an  immediate threat to human safety or eagles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There is no practicable alternative to nest removal that would  protect the interest to be served; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Issuing the permit will not preclude the Service from  authorizing another take necessary to protect an interest of higher  priority, according to the following prioritization order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Safety emergencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Native American religious use for rites and ceremonies that  require eagles be taken from the wild;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Renewal of programmatic nest-take permits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Non-emergency activities necessary to ensure public health and  safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Resource development or recovery operations (under Sec.  22.25,  for golden eagle nests only);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For take that is not necessary to alleviate an immediate threat  to human safety or eagles, we additionally must find that suitable  nesting and foraging habitat is available to the area nesting population  of eagles to accommodate any eagles displaced by the nest removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tenure of permits. The tenure of any permit to take eagle nests  under this section is set forth on the face of the permit and will not  be longer than 5 years.  [74 FR 46877, Sept. 11, 2009]</p>
