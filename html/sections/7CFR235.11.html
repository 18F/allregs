                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State funds. Expenditures of funds from State sources in any  fiscal year for the administration of the National School Lunch Program,  School Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care  Food Program shall not be less than that expended or obligated in fiscal  year 1977. Failure of a State to maintain this level of funding will  result in the total withdrawal of SAE funds. State agencies shall follow  the provisions of 7 CFR part 3016 in identifying and documenting  expenditures of funds from State revenues to meet the State funding  requirement of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sanctions imposed. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may recover, withhold or cancel  payment of up to one hundred (100) percent of the funds payable to a  State agency under this part, whenever it is determined by FNS that the  State agency has failed to comply with the requirements contained in  this part and in parts 210, 215, 220 and 226 of this title and in part  250 of this title as it applies to the operation of the Food  Distribution Program in schools and child and adult care institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the general provisions found in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, FNS may, for any fiscal year, recover, withhold or  cancel payment of up to thirty-three and one-third (33\1/3\) percent of  the funds payable to, and to be used by, a State agency under  Sec. 235.4(a)(1) and Sec. 235.4(b)(3) for administration of school  nutrition programs in FNS determines that a State agency is deficient in  one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Implementing the requirements in Sec. 210.18;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conducting the number of reviews required in Sec. 210.18 within  the timeframes specified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Covering the areas of review set forth in the Sec. 210.18,  carrying out corrective action, and assessing and recovering claims as  prescribed in Sec. Sec. 210.18 and 210.19 of this title;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Conducting reviews with sufficient thoroughness to identify  violations of the areas of review identified in Sec. 210.18; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Meeting the reporting deadlines prescribed for the forms (FNS-10  and SF-269) required under Sec. 210.5(d) of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Furthermore, FNS may for any fiscal year, recover, withhold or  cancel payment of up to thirty-three and one-third (33\1/3\) percent of  the funds payable to, and to be used by, a State agency under  Sec. 235.4(a)(2), Sec. 235.4(b)(1) and Sec. 235.4(b)(4) for  administration of the Child and Adult Care Food Program if FNS  determines that a State agency is deficient in meeting the reporting  deadlines prescribed for the forms (FNS-44 and SF-269) required under  Sec. 226.7(d) of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In establishing the amounts of funds to be recovered, withheld  or cancelled under paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, FNS  shall determine the current or projected rate of funds usage by the  State agency for all funds subject to sanction, and after considering  the severity and longevity of the cumulative deficiencies, shall apply  an appropriate sanction percentage to the amount so determined. During  the fiscal year under sanction, a State agency may not use funds not  included in the determination of funds usage to replace sanctioned  funds. The maximum sanction percentage that may be imposed against a  State agency for failure within one or more of the five deficiency areas  specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for any fiscal year shall  be thirty-three and one-third (33\1/3\) percent of the funds payable  under Sec. 235.4(a)(1) and Sec. 235.4(b)(3) for administration of school  nutrition programs for such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Before carrying out any sanction against a State agency under  this section, the following procedures shall be implemented:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> FNS shall notify the Chief State School Officer or equivalent of  the deficiencies found and of its intention to impose sanctions unless  an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted and approved by FNS  within 60 calendar days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency shall develop a corrective action plan with  specific timeframes to correct the deficiencies and/or prevent their  future recurrence. The plan will include dates by which the State agency  will accomplish such corrective action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> FNS shall review the corrective action plan. If it is  acceptable, FNS shall issue a letter to the Chief State School Officer  or equivalent approving the corrective action plan, and detailing the  technical assistance that is available to the State agency to correct  the deficiencies. The letter shall advise the Chief State School Officer  or equivalent of the specific sanctions to be imposed if the corrective  action plan is not implemented within timeframes set forth in the  approved plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon advice from the State agency that corrective action has  been taken, FNS shall assess such action and, if necessary, shall  perform a follow-up review to determine if the noted deficiencies have  been corrected. FNS shall then advise the State agency if the actions  taken are in compliance with the corrective action plan or if additional  corrective action is needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If an acceptable corrective action plan is not submitted and  approved within 60 calendar days, or if corrective action is not  completed within the time limits established in the corrective action  plan, FNS may impose a sanction by assessing a claim against the State  agency or taking action in accordance with 7 CFR part 3016. FNS shall  notify the Chief State School Officer or equivalent of any such action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If, subsequent to the imposition of any sanction, FNS  determines that the noted deficiencies have been resolved and that the  programs for which SAE funds were made available are being operated in  an acceptable manner, FNS may return to the State agency or restore to  the State agency's Letter of Credit (LOC) part or all of any sanctioned  SAE funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In carrying out sanctions under this part for any fiscal year,  FNS may reduce the amount of allocated SAE funds payable to a State  agency in whole or in part during such fiscal year and during following  fiscal years if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any State agency which has a sanction imposed against it in  accordance with this paragraph shall not be eligible to participate in  any reallocation of SAE funds under Sec. 235.5(d) of   this part during any fiscal year in which such sanction is being  applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination for convenience. FNS and the State agency may  terminate the State agency's participation under this part in whole, or  in part, when both parties agree that continuation would not produce  beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds.  The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including  the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion  to be terminated. The State agency shall not incur new obligations for  the terminated portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as  many outstanding obligations as possible. FNS shall allow full credit to  the State agency for the Federal share of the noncancellable  obligations, properly incurred by the State agency prior to termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In taking any action under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this  section, FNS and the State agency shall comply with the provisions of 7  CFR part 3016 concerning grant suspension, termination and closeout  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State requirements. Nothing contained in this part shall prevent  a State agency from imposing additional operating requirements which are  not inconsistent with the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administrative review process. When FNS asserts a sanction  against a State agency under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this  section, the State agency may appeal the case and be afforded a review  by an FNS Administrative Review Officer of the record including any  additional written submissions prepared by the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS shall provide a written notice and shall ensure the receipt  of such notice when asserting a sanction against a State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State agency aggrieved by a sanction asserted against it may  file a written request with the Director, Administrative Review Staff,  U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, 3101 Park  Center Drive, Alexandria, Va. 22302 for a review of the record. Such  request must be postmarked within 30 calendar days of the date of  delivery of the sanction notice and the envelope containing the request  shall be prominently marked ``REQUEST FOR REVIEW.'' If the State agency  does not request a review within 30 calendar days of the date of  delivery of the sanction notice, the administrative decision on the  sanction shall be final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a request for review, FNS shall promptly provide  the State agency with a written acknowledgment of the request. The  acknowledgment shall include the name and address of the FNS  Administrative Review Officer reviewing the sanction. The acknowledgment  shall also notify the State agency that any additional information in  support of its position must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the  receipt of the acknowledgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a review is requested, the FNS Administrative Review  Officer shall review all available information and shall make a final  determination within 45 calendar days after receipt of the State  agency's additional information. The final determination shall take  effect upon delivery of the written notice of this final decision to the  State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The final determination of the FNS Administrative Review Officer  will be the Department's final decision in the case and will not be  subject to reconsideration.
