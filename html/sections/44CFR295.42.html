                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initiating arbitration. A Claimant who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Administrative Appeal may initiate binding arbitration by submitting a written request for arbitration to the Arbitration Administrator for Cerro Grande Claims, Alternate Dispute Resolution Office, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., room 214, Washington, DC 20472 on a form provided by OCGFC. The written request for arbitration must be received not later than 60 days after the date that appears on the Administrative Appeal decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permissible claims. A Claimant may not arbitrate an issue unless it was raised and decided in the Administrative Appeal. Arbitration will be conducted on the evidence in the Administrative Record. Evidence not previously entered into the Administrative Record will not be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Settlement and mediation alternatives. At any time after a request for arbitration is filed and before the time a decision is rendered, either party may request in writing that the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office stay further proceedings in the arbitration to facilitate settlement discussions. A mediator may be appointed (if requested by the parties) to facilitate settlement discussions. If both parties concur in the request, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will stay the arbitration and appoint a mediator at our expense. The stay may be terminated and the arbitration resumed upon written request of either party to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the dispute is settled, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will issue an order terminating the arbitration and provide the Claimant with a Release and Certification Form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Selection of arbitrator. Arbitrators will be selected from a list of qualified arbitrators who have agreed to serve provided by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the amount in dispute is $300,000 or less, the arbitration will be decided by one arbitrator selected by the Claimant from the list. If the amount in dispute exceeds $300,000, a panel of three arbitrators selected at random by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will decide the arbitration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conduct of arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in a manner determined by the arbitrator consistent with guidelines established by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will provide these guidelines upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Hearings. The arbitrator may convene a hearing at a location designated by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. Whenever possible hearings will be held in Los Alamos, New Mexico unless the parties jointly agree to a different location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Decision. After reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator(s) will render a decision in writing to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will transmit the decision to the Claimant and the Director of OCGFC. If a panel

of three arbitrators conducts the arbitration, at least two of the three arbitrators must sign the decision. The decision will be rendered no later than 10 Days after a hearing is concluded or 60 Days after the arbitration is initiated, whichever is earlier. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office may extend the time for a decision. The decision will establish the compensation due to the Claimant, if any, and the reasons therefore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Action on arbitration decision. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will forward the arbitration decision and a Release and Certification Form to the Claimant. A Claimant who has received or who has been awarded any compensation under the CGFAA must sign and return the Release and Certification Form, regardless of whether any additional compensation is awarded by the arbitration. Additional compensation awarded in the arbitration will be paid to the Claimant after the signed Release and Certification Form is received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Final decision. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on all parties and will not be subject to any administrative or judicial review. The arbitrator may correct clerical, typographical or computational errors as requested by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Administration of arbitration. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will serve as arbitration administrator and will conclusively resolve any procedural disputes arising in the course of the arbitration. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will pay the fees of the arbitrator and reimburse the arbitrator for arbitration related expenses unless the parties jointly agree otherwise.</p>
