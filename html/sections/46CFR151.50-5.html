                            <p class="depth0">When table 151.05 refers to this section, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Independent tanks shall be designed and tested for a head of at  least 8 feet above the top of the tank using   the specific gravity of the product to be carried. In addition, tank  design calculations shall demonstrate that the tank can withstand,  without rupture, a single loading to the highest level to which the  product may rise, if that exceeds 8 feet. In general, plate less than  five-sixteenths inch in thickness shall not be used in the fabrication  of independent tanks unless otherwise approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cargo tanks transporting liquids having a Reid vapor pressure  exceeding 14 pounds per square inch absolute or vented at a gauge  pressure exceeding 4 pounds per square inch, or where air or water  pressure is used to discharge the cargo, shall be fabricated as arc- welded unfired pressure vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unfired pressure vessel cargo tanks shall be designed for a  pressure not less than the vapor pressure, in pounds per square inch  gauge, of the lading at 115 [deg]F, or the maximum air or water pressure  used to discharge the cargo, whichever is greater, but in no case shall  the design pressure of such tanks be less than 30 pounds per square inch  gauge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Piping. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pumps and piping used for cargo transfer shall  be independent of all other piping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where multiple cargoes are carried, and the cargo piping  conveying cargoes covered under this section are led through cargo tanks  containing other products, the piping shall be encased in a tunnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where cargo lines handling other products, or bilge and ballast  piping are led through tanks containing cargoes covered by this section,  the piping shall be enclosed in a tunnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Gravity type cargo tanks shall be fitted with an approved  pressure-vacuum relief valve of not less than 2\1/2\-inch size, which  shall be set at a pressure of not less than 3 pounds per square inch  gauge, but not in excess of the design pressure of the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The discharge fittings from each safety relief or pressure  vacuum relief valve shall be directed in such a manner as to not impinge  on another tank, piping or any other equipment which would increase the  fire hazard should burning products be discharged from the safety or  pressure vacuum relief valve as a result of a fire or other casualty. In  addition, the discharges shall be directed away from areas where it is  likely that persons might be working and as remote as practicable from  ventilation inlets and ignition sources. A common discharge header may  be employed if desired. The area near the discharge fittings shall be  clearly marked as a hazardous area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A means shall be provided for either the reclamation or safe  venting of vapors during the loading and unloading operations. For this  purpose the safety relief or pressure vacuum relief valve shall be  provided with a valved bypass to a vapor return line shore connection  which shall be used whenever vapor return shore facilities are  available. In the event vapors must be vented to the atmosphere, a vent  riser shall extend at least 12 feet above the highest level accessible  to personnel. The vent riser may be collapsible for ease of stowage when  not in use. Vapor return lines or vent risers for tanks carrying the  same class product may be connected to a common header system if  desired. Tanks carrying cargoes covered by this section shall be vented  independent of tanks carrying other products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The pump room ventilation outlet duct exhausts shall terminate  at a distance of at least 6 feet above the enclosed space or pump room  and at least 6 feet from any entrance to the interior part of the  vessel. The discharge end of the exhaust ducts shall be located so as to  preclude the possibility of recirculating contaminated air through the  pump room, or other spaces where personnel may be present.
