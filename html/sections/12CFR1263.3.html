                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. FHFA hereby authorizes the Banks to approve or deny all applications for membership, subject to the requirements of this part. The authority to approve membership applications may be exercised only by a committee of the Bank's board of directors, the Bank president, or a senior officer who reports directly to the Bank president, other than an officer with responsibility for business development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision resolution. For each applicant, the Bank shall prepare a written resolution duly adopted by the Bank's board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors, or by an officer with delegated authority to approve

membership applications. The decision resolution shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the statements in the digest are accurate to the best of the Bank's knowledge, and are based on a diligent and comprehensive review of all available information identified in the digest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Bank's decision and the reasons therefor. Decisions to approve an application should state specifically that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant is authorized under the laws of the United States and the laws of the appropriate State to become a member of, purchase stock in, do business with, and maintain deposits in, the Bank to which the applicant has applied; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant meets all of the membership eligibility criteria of the Bank Act and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action on applications. The Bank shall act on an application within 60 calendar days of the date the Bank deems the application to be complete. An application is ``complete'' when a Bank has obtained all the information required by this part, and any other information the Bank deems necessary, to process the application. If an application that was deemed complete subsequently is deemed incomplete because the Bank determines during the review process that additional information is necessary to process the application, the Bank may stop the 60-day clock until the application again is deemed complete, and then resume the clock where it left off. The Bank shall notify an applicant in writing when its application is deemed by the Bank to be complete, and shall maintain a copy of such letter in the applicant's membership file. The Bank shall notify an applicant if the 60-day clock is stopped, and when the clock is resumed, and shall maintain a written record of such notifications in the applicant's membership file. Within three business days of a Bank's decision on an application, the Bank shall provide the applicant and FHFA with a copy of the Bank's decision resolution.</p>
