                            <p class="depth0">Another requirement for exemption under section 7(b)(3) is that the  enterprise must be ``independently owned and controlled''. Since this  requirement is in the conjunctive, it must be established that the  enterprise which is engaged in the wholesale or bulk distribution of  petroleum products is both independently owned and independently  controlled. (Wirtz v. Lunsford, 404 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 6).) At the hearing  before the Senate Labor Subcommittee, when the amendment was proposed  which eventually was incorporated in the Act as section 13(b)(10) by the  1961 amendments (later repealed by the 1966 amendments to the Act and  replaced by section 7(b)(3)), a spokesman for proponents of the  amendment made the following statement, which bears on this requirement  for exemption:</p><p class="depth0">The designation ``independent'' as applied to an oil jobber means  that he owns his own office, bulk storage, and delivery facilities; pays  his own personnel, and in all respects   conducts his business as any other independent businessman.</p><p class="depth0">It also means that the jobber is not a subsidiary of nor controlled  by any so-called major oil company, although the jobber may sell the  branded products of such a company.</p><p class="depth0">Some jobbers own service stations which they lease to independent  dealers and a small percentage of jobbers may operate one or more  service stations with their own salaried personnel. (Senate Hearings on  the Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, 87th Cong., first  session, p. 411.)   It appears, therefore, that the purpose of the requirement limiting the  exemption to the enterprises which are ``independently owned and  controlled,'' is to confine the exemption to those petroleum jobbers who  own their own facilities and equipment and who are not subsidiaries nor  controlled by any producer, refinery, terminal supplier or so-called  major oil company. (See Wirtz v. Lunsford, cited above.) The fact that  the petroleum jobber sells a branded product of a major oil company will  not, of itself, affect the status of his enterprise as one which is  ``independently owned and controlled''. So also the fact that the jobber  owns gasoline service stations, which he leases or which he operates  himself, will not affect the status of his enterprise as being  ``independently owned and controlled''.    Sec. 794.115  ``Independently owned.''</p><p class="depth0">Ownership of the enterprise may be vested in an individual petroleum  jobber, or a partnership, or a corporation, so long as such ownership is  not shared by a major oil company, or other producer, refiner,  distributor or supplier of petroleum products, so as to affect the  independent ownership of the enterprise. As noted in Sec. 794.114, an  enterprise will not be considered independently owned where it does not  own its own office, bulk storage, and delivery facilities. The  enterprise may also not be considered ``independently owned'' where it  does not own its stock-in-trade. (See Wirtz v. Lunsford, 404 F.2d 693  (C.A. 6).) It is recognized that, in the ordinary course of business  dealings, an independently owned enterprise may purchase its goods on  credit and this, of course, will not affect its characterization as  being ``independently owned'' within the meaning of the exemption.  However, there may well be a question as to whether the enterprise is  ``independently owned'' where the enterprise receives its petroleum  products on consignment and the supplier lays claim to the ownership of  the account receivable. Of possible relevance also is the intent evident  in the statutory language to provide exemption only for an enterprise  which can meet the specified tests which depend on ``the sales of such  enterprise.'' The determination in such cases, as in other cases  involving questions of independent ownership, will necessarily depend on  all the facts.    Sec. 794.116  ``Independently * * * controlled.''</p><p class="depth0">As explained in Sec. 794.114, the enterprise in addition to being  independently owned must also be ``independently controlled.'' The test  here is whether the individual, partnership, or corporation which owns  the enterprise also controls the enterprise as an independent  businessman, free of control by any so-called major oil company or other  person engaged in the petroleum business. Control by others may be  evidenced by ownership; but control may exist in the absence of any  ownership. For example where an enterprise engaged in the wholesale or  bulk distribution of petroleum products enters into franchise or other  arrangements which have the effect of restricting the products it  distributes, the prices it may charge, or otherwise controlling the  activities of the enterprise in those respects which are the common  attributes of an independent businessman, these facts may establish that  the enterprise is not ``independently controlled'' as required by the  exemption under section 7(b)(3).
