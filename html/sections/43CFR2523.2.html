Unless the entry be perfected under  the Act of February 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 349; 43 U.S.C. 339), the only  payments made to the Government are the original payment of 25 cents an  acre at the time of making the application and the final payment of $1  an acre, to be paid at the time of making the final proof. On all final  proofs made before the authorizing officer, the claimant must pay to the  authorizing officer the costs of reducing the testimony to writing, as  determined by the authorizing officer. No proof shall be accepted or  approved until all charges have been paid.
