                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When certification is required. Whenever all of the deposit liabilities of an insured depository institution are assumed by one or more insured depository institutions by merger, consolidation, other statutory assumption, or by contract, the transferring insured depository institution, or its legal successor, shall provide an accurate written certification to the FDIC that its deposit liabilities have been assumed. No certification shall be required when deposit liabilities are assumed by an operating insured depository institution from an insured depository institution in default, as defined in section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(x)(1)), and that has been placed under FDIC receivership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification requirements. The certification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided on official letterhead of the transferring insured depository institution or its legal successor, signed by a duly authorized official, and state the date the assumption took effect. The certification shall indicate the date on which the transferring institution's authority to engage in banking has terminated or will terminate as well as the method of termination (e.g., whether by the surrender of its charter, by the cancellation of its charter or license to conduct a banking business, or otherwise). The certification may follow the form contained in Appendix A of this part. In a merger or consolidation where there is only one surviving entity which is the legal successor to both the transferring and assuming institutions, the surviving entity shall provide any required certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing. The certification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided within 30 calendar days after the assumption takes effect, and shall be submitted to the appropriate Regional Director of the FDIC's Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, as defined in 12 CFR 303.2(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence of assumption. The receipt by the FDIC of an accurate certification for a total assumption as required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall constitute satisfactory evidence of such deposit assumption, as required by section 8(q) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(q)), and the insured status of the transferring institution shall terminate on the date of the

receipt of the certification. In appropriate circumstances, the FDIC, in its sole discretion, may require additional information, or may consider other evidence of a deposit assumption to constitute satisfactory evidence of such assumption for purposes of section 8(q).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance of an order. The Executive Secretary, upon request from the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection and with the concurrence of the General Counsel, or their respective designees, shall issue an order terminating the insured status of the transferring insured depository institution as of the date of receipt by the FDIC of satisfactory evidence of such assumption, pursuant to section 8(q) of the FDI Act and this regulation. Generally, no order shall be issued, under this paragraph, and insured status shall be cancelled by operation of law:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the charter of the transferring institution has been cancelled, revoked, rescinded, or otherwise terminated by operation of applicable state or federal statutes or regulations, or by action of the chartering authority for the transferring institution essentially contemporaneously, that is, generally within five business days after all deposits have been assumed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transferring institution is an insured depository institution in default and for which the FDIC has been appointed receiver.</p>
