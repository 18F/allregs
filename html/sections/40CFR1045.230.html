                                Sec.  1045.230  How do I select engine families?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, divide your product line into  families of engines that are expected to have similar emission  characteristics throughout their useful life as described in this  section. Your engine family is limited to a single model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Group engines into the same engine family if they are the same  in all the following aspects:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combustion cycle and fuel. See paragraph (e) of this section  for special provisions that apply for dual-fuel engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of air aspiration (for example, turbocharged vs.  naturally aspirated).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number, location, volume, and composition of catalytic  converters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The number, arrangement (such as in-line or vee configuration),  and approximate bore diameter of cylinders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Method of control for engine operation, other than governing  (i.e., mechanical or electronic).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The numerical level of the applicable emission standards. For  example, an engine family may not include engines certified to different  family emission limits, though you may change family emission limits  without recertifying as specified in Sec.  1045.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may subdivide a group of engines that is identical under  paragraph (b) of this section into different engine families if you show  the expected emission characteristics are different during the useful  life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may group engines that are not identical with respect to the  things listed in paragraph (b) of this section into the same engine  family, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In unusual circumstances, you may group such engines into the  same engine family if you show that their emission characteristics  during the useful life will be similar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a small-volume engine manufacturer, you may group all  your high-performance engines into a single engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (e) do not exempt any engines  from meeting all the emission standards and requirements in subpart B of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may certify dual-fuel or flexible-fuel engines in a single  engine family. You may include dedicated-fuel versions of this same  engine model in the same engine family, as long as they are identical to  the engine configuration with respect to that fuel type for the dual- fuel or flexible-fuel version of the engine. For example, if you produce  an engine that can alternately run on gasoline and natural gas, you can  include the gasoline-only and natural gas-only versions of the engine in  the same engine family as the dual-fuel engine if engine operation on  each fuel type is identical with or without installation of components  for operating on the other fuel.
