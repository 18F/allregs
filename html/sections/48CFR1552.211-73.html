The Government hereby orders __ direct labor hours for the base period, which represents the Government's best estimate of the level of effort to fulfill these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Direct labor includes personnel such as engineers, scientists, draftsmen, technicians, statisticians, and programmers and not support personnel such as company management, typists, and key punch operators even though such support personnel are normally treated as direct labor by the Contractor. The level of effort specified in paragraph (a) includes Contractor, subcontractor, and consultant labor hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Contractor provides less than 90 percent of the level of effort specified for the base period or any optional period ordered, an equitable downward adjustment of the fixed fee, if any, for that period will be made. The Government may require the Contractor to provide additional effort up to 110 percent of the level of effort for any period until the estimated cost for that period has been reached. However, this additional effort shall not result in any increase in the fixed fee, if any. If this is a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract, the term ``fee'' in this paragraph means ``base fee and incentive fee.'' If this is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract, the term ``fee'' in this paragraph means ``base fee and award fee.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the level of effort specified to be ordered during a given base or option period is not ordered during that period, that level of effort may not be acumulated and ordered during a subsequent period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of either the ``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
