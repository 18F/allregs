In all  cases, mitigation shall include the requirement for hiring preferences  for employees whose positions have been terminated (except for  termination for cause) as a result of changes to the work force at the  facility due to restructuring accomplished under the requirements of  section 3161. Where applicable, contractors may take additional actions  to mitigate consistent with the Department's Workforce Restructuring  Plan for the facility or site.</p>
