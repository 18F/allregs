                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements set forth in this part 802 describe certain specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for grain weighing equipment and related grain handling systems used in performing Class X and Class Y weighing services, official inspection services, and commercial services under the Act. All scales used for

official grain weight and inspection certification services provided by FGIS must meet applicable requirements contained in the FGIS Weighing Handbook, the General Code, the Scales Code, the Automatic Bulk Weighing Systems Code, and the Weights Code of the 2008 edition of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 44, ``Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices'' (Handbook 44); and NIST Handbook 105-1 (1990 Edition), ``Specifications and Tolerances for Reference Standards and Field Standard Weights and Measures,'' (Handbook 105-1). These requirements are confirmed to be met by having National Type Evaluation Program type approval. Scales used for commercial purposes will be required to meet only the applicable requirements of the 2008 edition of the NIST Handbook-44. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a), with the exception of the Handbook 44 requirements listed in paragraph (b), the materials in Handbooks 44 and 105-1 are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of approval and a notice of any change in these materials will be published in the Federal Register. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register on March 8, 2011, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The NIST Handbooks are for sale by the National Conference of Weights and Measures (NCWM), 1135 M Street, Suite 110, Lincoln, Nebraska 68508. Information on these materials may be obtained from NCWM by calling 402-434-4880, by E-mailing nfo@ncwm.net, or on the Internet at http://www.nist.gov/owm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following Handbook 44 requirements are not incorporated by reference:</p><p class="depth2">Scales (2.20)
