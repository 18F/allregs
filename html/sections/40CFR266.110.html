                            <p class="depth0">Boilers that operate under the special requirements of this section,  and that do not burn hazardous waste containing (or derived from) EPA  Hazardous Waste Nos. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027, are  considered to be in conformance with the DRE standard of Sec.   266.104(a), and a trial burn to demonstrate DRE is waived. When burning  hazardous waste:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A minimum of 50 percent of fuel fired to the device shall be  fossil fuel, fuels derived from fossil fuel, tall oil, or, if approved  by the Director on a case-by-case basis, other nonhazardous fuel with  combustion characteristics comparable to fossil fuel. Such fuels are  termed ``primary fuel'' for purposes of this section. (Tall oil is a  fuel derived from vegetable and rosin fatty acids.) The 50 percent  primary fuel firing rate shall be determined on a total heat or mass  input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of primary  fuel fired;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Boiler load shall not be less than 40 percent. Boiler load is  the ratio at any time of the total heat input to the maximum design heat  input;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Primary fuels and hazardous waste fuels shall have a minimum as- fired heating value of 8,000 Btu/lb, and each material fired in a burner  where hazardous waste is fired must have a heating value of at least  8,000 Btu/lb, as-fired;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The device shall operate in conformance with the carbon monoxide  standard provided by Sec.  266.104(b)(1). Boilers subject to the waiver  of the DRE trial burn provided by this section are not eligible for the  alternative carbon monoxide standard provided by Sec.  266.104(c);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The boiler must be a watertube type boiler that does not feed  fuel using a stoker or stoker type mechanism; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The hazardous waste shall be fired directly into the primary  fuel flame zone of the combustion chamber with an air or steam  atomization firing system, mechanical atomization system, or a rotary  cup atomization system under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Viscosity. The viscosity of the hazardous waste fuel as-fired  shall not exceed 300 SSU;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particle size. When a high pressure air or steam atomizer, low  pressure atomizer, or mechanical atomizer is used, 70% of the hazardous  waste fuel must pass through a 200 mesh (74 micron) screen, and when a  rotary cup atomizer is used, 70% of the hazardous waste must pass  through a 100 mesh (150 micron) screen;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mechanical atomization systems. Fuel pressure within a  mechanical atomization system and fuel flow rate shall be maintained  within the design range taking into account the viscosity and volatility  of the fuel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rotary cup atomization systems. Fuel flow rate through a rotary  cup atomization system must be maintained within the design range taking  into account the viscosity and volatility of the fuel.
