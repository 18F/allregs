                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures described herein establish an ``ability to pay'' test  which will be applied to all flood control projects. As a result of the  application of the test, some projects will be cost-shared by the non- Federal interest at a lower level than the standard non-Federal share  that would be required under the provisions of section 103 of Pub. L.  99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213. The ``standard share'', as used herein, refers  to the non-Federal share that would apply to the project before any  ability to pay consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> be  subject to the ability to pay test. The test must therefore be applied  not only to projects specifically authorized by Congress, but to the  continuing authority projects constructed under section 14 of the 1946  Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701r), section 205 of the 1948 Flood  Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701s), and section 208 of the 1954 Flood Control  Act (33 U.S.C. 701g), all as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ability to pay test shall be conducted independently of any  analysis of a project sponsor's ability to finance its ultimate share of  proposed project costs. The ability to finance is addressed in a  statement of financial capability which considers current borrowing  constraints, alternative sources of liquidity, etc. It is therefore much  more narrowly defined than the ability to pay test, which considers the  underlying resource base of the community as a whole. The ability to pay  test shall not be used to affect project scope, or to change budgetary  priorities among projects competing for scarce Federal funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any reductions in the level of non-Federal cost-sharing as a  result of the application of this test will be applied to construction  costs only. Operations, maintenance and rehabilitation responsibilities  are unaffected by the ability to pay test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, the ability to pay test will be applied  before any adjustments are made for credits. If the ability to pay test  results in a lower non-Federal   share, the allowable amount of credits will be limited by the lower  share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The test is based on the following principles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Since the standard non-Federal cost-share is substantilly less  than full costs in every case, the ability to pay test should be  structured so that reductions in the level of cost-sharing will be  granted in only a limited number of cases of severe economic hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test should depend not only on the economic circumstances  within a project area, but also on the conditions of the state(s) in  which the project area is located. Although states' policies with  respect to supporting local interests on flood control projects are not  uniform, the state represents a potential source of financial assistance  which should be considered in the analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alternative level of cost-sharing determined under the  ability to pay principle should be governed in part by project benefits.  If, as a result of the project, local beneficiaries receive more income,  or are required to use fewer resources on flood damage repair or  replacement, or on flood insurance, a portion of these resources should  be available to pay for the non-Federal share, even in those cases where  an analysis of current economic conditions indicates that there are  relatively limited resources in the project area and its state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Since project benefits represent availability of resources in  the future, but not the present, project sponsors should be permitted to  defer a certain percentage of the non-Federal share whenever current  economic circumstances suggest that non-Federal resources may be  limited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Non-Federal interest may, at its discretion, waive the  application of the ability to pay test. In this case, the Non-Federal  interest shall be considered to have the ability to pay the standard  cost-share and no further economic inquiry will be required.</p>
