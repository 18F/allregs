                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general, your social security benefits are based on your  earnings that are on our records. (Subpart I of this part explains how  we keep earnings records.) Basically, you receive credit only for  earnings that are covered for social security purposes. The earnings are  covered only if your work is covered. If you are an employee, your  employer files a report of your covered earnings. If you are self- employed, you file a report of your covered earnings. Some work is  covered by social security and some work is not. Also, some earnings are  covered by social security and some are not. It is important that you  are aware of what kinds of work and earnings are covered so that you  will know whether your earnings should be on our records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are an employee, your covered work is called employment.  This subpart explains our rules on the kinds of work that are covered as  employment and the kinds that are not. We also explain who is an  employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your work is employment, your covered earnings are called  wages. This subpart explains our rules on the kinds of earnings that are  covered as wages and the kinds that are not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you work for yourself, you are self-employed. The subpart  explains our rules on the kinds of self-employment that are covered and  the kinds that are not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you are self-employed, your covered earnings are called self- employment income which is based on your net earnings from self- employment during a taxable year. This subpart explains our rules on the  kinds of earnings that are covered as net earnings from self-employment  and the kinds that are not. We also explain how to figure your net  earnings from self-employment and determine your self-employment income  which is the amount that goes on our records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We include basically only the rules that apply to current work  or that the law requires us to publish as regulations. We generally do  not include rules that are seldom used or do not apply to current work  because of changes in the law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code (Code)  have similar provisions on coverage of your earnings because the one law  specifies the earnings for which you will receive credit for benefit  purposes and the other the earnings on which you must pay social  security taxes. Because the Code (title 26 U.S.C.) has some provisions  that are not in the Act but which may affect you, you may need to refer  to the Code or the Internal Revenue Service regulations (title 26 of the  Code of Federal Regulations) to get complete information about your  social security coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The rules are organized in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 404.1003 through 404.1010 include the rules on  employment. We discuss what we mean by employment, what work is covered  as employment for social security purposes, and describe the kinds of  workers who are considered employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In Secs. 404.1012 through 404.1038 we discuss various types of  work that are not covered as employment for social security purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rules on wages are found in Secs. 404.1041 through 404.1059.  We describe what is meant by the term wages, discuss the various types  of pay that count as wages, and state when the pay counts for Social  Security purposes. We include explanations of agriculture labor,  domestic services, service not in the course of the employer's business,  and home worker services under wages because special standards apply to  these services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Our rules on self-employment and self-employment income are  found in Secs. 404.1065 through 404.1096. We discuss what we mean by  self-employment, what we mean by a trade or business, what types of  activities are considered self-employment, how to determine self- employment income, and how net earnings from self-employment are  figured.
