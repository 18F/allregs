To determine the stipend amount, VA first will determine the eligible veteran's level of dependency based on the degree to which the eligible veteran is unable to perform one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), or the degree to which the eligible veteran is in need of supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> VA will clinically rate the eligible veteran's inability to perform each of the seven ADLs listed in the definition of that term in Sec. 71.15.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> VA will clinically rate the eligible veteran's need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury using the seven impairments listed in the definition of that term in Sec. 71.15.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Clinical ratings under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section will be scored as follows: VA will assign a zero if the eligible veteran completes the task/activity without assistance; one if the eligible veteran requires minimal assistance (can complete 75 percent or more of the task without supervision or assistance); two if the eligible veteran requires moderate assistance (can complete 50 percent to 74 percent of the task without assistance); three if the eligible veteran requires maximal assistance (can complete 25 percent to 49 percent of the task without assistance); or four if the eligible veteran requires total assistance (can complete less than 25 percent of the task or is unable to do the task without assistance).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the sum of all of the ratings assigned is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 21 or higher, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 40 hours per week of caregiverassistance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 13 to 20, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 25 hours per week of caregiver assistance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 1 to 12, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 10 hours per week of caregiver assistance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The monthly stipend payment will be calculated by multiplying the combined rate by the number of weekly hours of caregiverassistance required under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. This product will then be multiplied by 4.35.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Stipend payments for the first month will be adjusted based on the number of days remaining in the month. Stipend payments will also be prorated where a Primary Family Caregiver's status is revoked and/or a

new Primary Family Caregiver is designated prior to the end of a month. See Sec. 71.45, Revocation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an employment relationship between the Secretary and an individual in receipt of assistance or support under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date and payment date of benefits-- (1) Effective date. Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date on which the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home, whichever is later. However, benefits will not be provided until the individual is designated as a Family Caregiver. Individuals who apply to be Family Caregivers must complete all necessary education, instruction, and training so that VA can complete the designation process no later than 45 days after the date that the joint application was submitted or, if the application has been placed on hold for a GAF assessment, 45 days after the hold has been lifted, or a new joint application will be required to serve as the date of application for payment purposes. VA may extend the 45-day period for up to 90 days after the date the joint application was submitted or, if the application has been placed on hold for a GAF assessment, for up to 90 days after the hold has been lifted. Such an extension may either be based on training identified under Sec. 71.25(d) that is still pending completion, or hospitalization of the eligible veteran.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective date.
