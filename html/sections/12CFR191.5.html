Except as provided in Sec. 191.4(c) and (d)(4) of this  part, due-on-sale practices of Federal savings associations and other  lenders shall be governed exclusively by the OCC's regulations, in  preemption of and without regard to any limitations imposed by state law  on either their inclusion or exercise including, without limitation,  state law prohibitions against restraints on alienation, prohibitions  against penalties and forfeitures, equitable restrictions and state law  dealing with equitable transfers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific limitations. With respect to any loan on the security  of a home occupied or to be occupied by the borrower,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A lender shall not (except with regard to a reverse mortgage)  exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the  lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of  rights of occupancy in the property: Provided, That such lien or  encumbrance is not created pursuant to a contract for deed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The creation of a purchase-money security interest for  household appliances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the  death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The granting of a leasehold interest which has a term of three  years or less and which does not contain an option to purchase (that is,  either a lease of more than three years or a lease with an option to  purchase will allow the exercise of a due-on-sale clause);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A transfer, in which the transferee is a person who occupies or  will occupy the property, which is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of the  borrower;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A transfer where the spouse or child(ren) becomes an owner of  the property; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A transfer resulting from a decree of dissolution of marriage,  legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement  agreement by which the spouse becomes an owner of the property; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is  and remains the beneficiary and occupant of the property, unless, as a  condition precedent to such transfer, the borrower refuses to provide  the lender with reasonable means acceptable to the lender by which the  lender will be assured of timely notice of any subsequent transfer of  the beneficial interest or change in occupancy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A lender shall not impose a prepayment penalty or equivalent fee   when the lender or party acting on behalf of the lender.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Declares by written notice that the loan is due pursuant to a  due-on-sale clause or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commences a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding to  enforce a due-on-sale clause or to seek payment in full as a result of  invoking such clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, a qualified  transferee is a person who qualifies for the loan under the lender's  applicable underwriting standards and who occupies or will occupy the  security property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A lender waives its option to exercise a due-on-sale clause as  to a specific transfer if, before the transfer, the lender and the  existing borrower's prospective successor in interest agree in writing  that the successor in interest will be obligated under the terms of the  loan and that interest on sums secured by the lender's security interest  will be payable at a rate the lender shall request. Upon such agreement  and resultant waiver, a lender shall release the existing borrower from  all obligations under the loan instruments, and the lender is deemed to  have made a new loan to the existing borrower's successor in interest.  The waiver and release apply to all loans secured by homes occupied by  borrowers made by a Federal savings association after July 31, 1976, and  to all loans secured by homes occupied by borrowers made by other  lenders after the effective date of this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be construed  to restrict a lender's right to enforce a due-on-sale clause upon the  subsequent occurrence of any event which disqualifies a transfer for a  previously-applicable exception under that paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Policy considerations. Paragraph (b) of this section does not  prohibit a lender from requiring, as a condition to an assumption,  continued maintenance of mortgage insurance by the existing borrower's  successor in interest, whether by endorsement of the existing policy or  by entrance into a new contract of insurance.</p>
