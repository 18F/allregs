                            <p class="depth0">To apply for a pre-disaster mitigation loan your business must submit a complete Pre-Disaster Mitigation Small Business Loan Application (application) within the announced filing period. Complete applications mailed to SBA and postmarked within the announced filing period will be accepted. The complete application serves as your business' loan request. A complete application supplies all of the filing requirements specified on the application form including a written statement from the local or State coordinator confirming:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The business that is the subject of the mitigation measure is located within the participating pre-disaster mitigation community; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The mitigation measure is in accordance with the specific priorities and goals of the local participating pre-disaster mitigation community in which the business is located. (The local or State coordinator's written statement does not constitute an endorsement or technical approval of the project and is not a guarantee that the project will prevent damage in future disasters).</p>
