                                Sec. 9701.313  Homeland Security Compensation Committee.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DHS will establish a Homeland Security Compensation Committee to  provide options and/or recommendations for consideration by the  Secretary or designee on strategic compensation matters such as  Departmental compensation policies and principles, the annual allocation  of funds between market and performance pay adjustments, and the annual  adjustment of rate ranges and locality and special rate supplements. The  Compensation Committee will consider factors such as turnover,  recruitment, and local labor market conditions in providing options and  recommendations for consideration by the Secretary. The Secretary's or  designee's determination with regard to those options and/or  recommendations is final and not subject to further review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Compensation Committee will be chaired by the DHS  Undersecretary for Management. The Compensation Committee has 14  members, including 4 officials of labor organizations granted national  consultation rights (NCR) in accordance with Sec. 9701.518(d)(2). An OPM  official will serve as an ex officio member of the Compensation  Committee. DHS will provide technical staff to support the Compensation  Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DHS will establish procedures governing the membership and  operation of the Compensation Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An individual will be selected by the Chair to facilitate  Compensation Committee meetings. The facilitator will be selected from a  list of nominees developed jointly by representatives of the Department  and NCR labor organizations, the latter acting as a single party,  according to procedures and time limits established by implementing  directives. Nominees must be known for their integrity, impartiality,  and expertise in facilitation and compensation. If the Department and  the labor organizations are unable to reach agreement on a joint list of  nominees, they will enlist the services of the Federal Mediation and  Conciliation Service (FMCS) to assist them. If the parties are unable to  reach agreement with FMCS assistance, each party will prepare a list of  up to three nominees and provide those separate lists to FMCS; FMCS may  add up to three additional nominees. From that combined list of  nominees, the Department and the labor organizations, the latter acting  as a single party, will alternately strike names from the list until  five names remain; those five nominees will be submitted to the Chair  for consideration. The Chair may request that the parties develop an  additional list of nominees. If the representatives of the Department's  NCR labor organizations, acting as a single party, do not participate in  developing the list of nominees in accordance with this section, the  Chair will select the facilitator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After considering the views of all Compensation Committee  members, the Chair prepares and provides options and/or recommendations  to the Secretary or designee. Members may present their views on the  final recommendations in writing as part of the final recommendation  package. The Secretary or designee will make the final decision and  notify the Compensation Committee. This process is not subject to the  requirements established by Secs. 9701.512 (regarding conferring on  procedures for the exercise of management rights), 9701.517(a)(5)  (regarding enforcement of the duty to consult or negotiate), 9701.518  (regarding the duty to bargain, confer, and consult), or 9701.519  (regarding impasse procedures).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Secretary retains the right to make determinations regarding  the annual allocation of funds between market and performance pay  adjustments, the annual adjustment of rate ranges and locality and  special rate supplements, or any other matter recommended by the  Compensation Committee, and to make such determinations effective at any  time.</p>
