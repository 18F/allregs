An act or practice committed outside the United States by a foreign bank or its directors or trustees which would otherwise be a ground for termination of insured status under this section shall be a ground for termination if the Board of Directors finds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The act or practice has been, is, or is likely to be a cause of, or carried on in connection with or in furtherance of, an act or practice committed within any state, territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia that, in and of itself, would be an appropriate basis for action by the FDIC; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The act or practice committed outside the United States, if proven, would adversely affect the insurance risk of the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure of foreign bank to secure removal of personnel.
