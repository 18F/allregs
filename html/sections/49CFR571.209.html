Webbing from three seat belt assemblies shall be conditioned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and tested for breaking strength in a testing machine of capacity verified to have an error of not more than one percent in the range of the breaking strength of the webbing in accordance with ASTM E4-79 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5). The machine shall be equipped with split drum grips illustrated in Figure 1, having a diameter between 51 and 102 mm. The rate of grip separation shall be between 51 and 102 mm per minute. The distance between the centers of the grips at the start of the test shall be between 102 and 254 mm. After placing the specimen in the grips, the webbing shall be stretched continuously at a uniform rate to failure. Each value shall be not less than the applicable breaking strength requirement in S4.2(b), but the median value shall be used for determining the retention of breaking strength in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elongation. Elongation shall be measured during the breaking strength test described in paragraph (b) of this section by the following procedure: A preload between 196 N and 245 N shall be placed on the webbing mounted in the grips of the testing machine and the needle points of an extensometer, in which the points remain parallel during test, are inserted in the center of the specimen. Initially the points shall be set at a known distance apart between 102 and 203 mm. When the force on the webbing reaches the value specified in S4.2(c), the increase in separation of the points of the extensometer shall be measured and the percent elongation shall be calculated to the nearest 0.5 percent. Each value shall be not more than the appropriate elongation requirement in S4.2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Resistance to abrasion. The webbing from three seat belt assemblies shall be tested for resistance to abrasion by rubbing over the hexagon bar prescribed in Figure 2 in the following manner: The webbing shall be mounted in the apparatus shown schematically in Figure 2.

The webbing shall be passed over the two new abrading edges of the hexagon bar (C) and the other end attached to an oscillating drum (D) which has a stroke of 330 mm. Suitable guides shall be used to prevent movement of the webbing along the axis of hexagonal bar C. Drum D shall be oscillated for 5,000 strokes or 2,500 cycles at a rate of 60 2 strokes per minute or 30 1 cycles per minute. The abraded webbing shall be conditioned as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section and tested for breaking strength by the procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section. The median values for the breaking strengths determined on abraded and unabraded specimens shall be used to calculate the percentage of breaking strength retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Resistance to light. Webbing at least 508 mm in length from three seat belt assemblies shall be suspended vertically on the inside of the specimen track in a Type E carbon-arc light exposure apparatus described in ASTM G23-81 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5), except that the filter used for 100 percent polyester yarns shall be chemically strengthened soda-lime glass with a transmittance of less than 5 percent for wave lengths equal to or less than 305 nanometers and 90 percent or greater transmittance for wave lengths of 375 to 800 nanometers. The apparatus shall be operated without water spray at an air temperature of 60[deg] 2 [deg]Celsius ([deg]C) measured at a point 25 5 mm outside the specimen rack and midway in height. The temperature sensing element shall be shielded from radiation. The specimens shall be exposed to light from the carbon-arc for 100 hours and then conditioned as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. The colorfastness of the exposed and conditioned specimens shall be determined on the AATCC Gray Scale for Evaluating Change in Color (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5). The breaking strength of the specimens

shall be determined by the procedure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. The median values for the breaking strengths determined on exposed and unexposed specimens shall be used to calculate the percentage of breaking strength retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Resistance to micro-organisms. Webbing at least 508 millimeters (mm) in length from three seat belt assemblies shall first be preconditioned in accordance with appendix A(1) and (2) of AATCC Test Method 30-1981 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5), and then subjected to Test I, ``Soil Burial Test'' of that test method. After soil-burial for a period of 2 weeks, the specimen shall be washed in water, dried and conditioned as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. The breaking strengths of the specimens shall be determined by the procedure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. The median values for the breaking strengths determined on exposed and unexposed specimens shall be used to calculate the percentage of breaking strength retained.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This test shall not be required on webbing made from material which is inherently resistant to micro-organisms.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2 Hardware.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corrosion resistance. Three seat belt assemblies shall be tested in accordance with ASTM B117-73 (Reapproved 1979) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5).

The period of test shall be 50 hours for all attachment hardware at or near the floor, consisting of two periods of 24 hours exposure to salt spray followed by 1 hour drying and 25 hours for all other hardware, consisting of one period of 24 hours exposure to salt spray followed by 1 hour drying. In the salt spray test chamber, the parts from the three assemblies shall be oriented differently, selecting those orientations most likely to develop corrosion on the larger areas. At the end of test, the seat belt assembly shall be washed thoroughly with water to remove the salt. After drying for at least 24 hours under standard laboratory conditions specified in S5.1(a) attachment hardware shall be examined for ferrous corrosion on significant surfaces, that is, all surfaces that can be contacted by a sphere 19 mm in diameter, and other hardware shall be examined for ferrous and nonferrous corrosion which may be transferred, either directly or by means of the webbing, to a person or his clothing during use of a seat belt assembly incorporating the hardware.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When attachment and other hardware are permanently fastened, by sewing or other means, to the same piece of webbing, separate assemblies shall be used to test the two types of hardware. The test for corrosion resistance shall not be required for attachment hardware made from corrosion-resistant steel containing at least 11.5 percent chromium or for attachment hardware protected with an electrodeposited coating of nickel, or copper and nickel, as prescribed in S4.3(a).

The vertical force shall be released, and a force of 667 N 9 N shall be applied horizontally as near as possible to the free end of the retainer latch. The movement of the latch by this force at the point of load application shall be measured.

After completion of the corrosion-resistance test described in paragraph (a) of this section, the webbing shall be fully extended and allowed to dry for at least 24 hours under standard laboratory conditions specified in S5.1(a). The retractor shall be examined for ferrous and nonferrous corrosion which may be transferred, either directly or by means of the webbing, to a person or his clothing during use of a seat belt assembly incorporating the retractor, and for ferrous corrosion on significant surfaces if the retractor is part of the attachment hardware. The webbing shall be withdrawn manually and allowed to retract for 25 cycles. The retractor shall be mounted in an apparatus capable of extending the webbing fully, applying a force of 89 N at full extension, and allowing the webbing to retract freely and completely. The webbing shall be withdrawn from the retractor and allowed to retract repeatedly in this apparatus until 2,500 cycles are completed. The retractor and webbing shall then be subjected to the temperature resistance test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. The retractor shall be subjected to 2,500 additional cycles of webbing withdrawal and retraction. Then, the retractor and webbing shall be subjected to dust in a chamber similar to one illustrated in Figure 8 containing about 0.9 kg of coarse grade dust conforming to the specification given in SAE Recommended Practice J726 SEP79 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5). The dust shall be agitated every 20 minutes for 5 seconds by compressed air, free of oil and moisture, at a gage pressure of 550 55 kPa entering through an orifice 1.5 0.1 mm in diameter. The webbing shall be extended to the top of the chamber and kept extended at all times except that the webbing shall be subjected to 10 cycles of complete retraction and extension within 1 to 2 minutes after each agitation of the dust. At the end of 5 hours, the assembly shall be removed from the chamber. The webbing shall be fully withdrawn from the retractor manually and allowed to retract completely for 25 cycles.

The locking mechanism of an emergency locking retractor shall be actuated at least 10,000 times within 50 to 100 percent extension of webbing during the 50,000 cycles. At the end of test, compliance of the retractors with applicable requirements in S4.3 (h), (i), and (j) shall be determined. Three retractors shall be tested for performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Type 1 seat belt assembly. Three complete seat belt assemblies, including webbing, straps, buckles, adjustment and attachment hardware, and retractors, arranged in the form of a loop as shown in Figure 5, shall be tested in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The testing machine shall conform to the requirements specified in S5.1(b). A double-roller block shall be attached to one head of the testing machine.

The rollers shall be mounted on antifriction bearings and spaced 305 mm between centers, and shall have sufficient capacity so that there is no brinelling, bending or other distortion of parts which may affect the results. An anchorage bar shall be fastened to the other head of the testing machine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The attachment hardware furnished with the seat belt assembly shall be attached to the anchorage bar. The anchor points shall be spaced so that the webbing is parallel in the two sides of the loop. The attaching bolts shall be parallel to, or at an angle of 45[deg] or 90[deg] to the webbing, whichever results in an angle nearest to 90[deg] between webbing and attachment hardware except that eye bolts shall be vertical, and attaching bolts or nonthreaded anchorages of a seat belt assembly designed for use in specific models of motor vehicles shall be installed to

produce the maximum angle in use indicated by the installation instructions, utilizing special fixtures if necessary to simulate installation in the motor vehicle. Rigid adapters between anchorage bar and attachment hardware shall be used if necessary to locate and orient the adjustment hardware. The adapters shall have a flat support face perpendicular to the threaded hole for the attaching bolt and adequate in area to provide full support for the base of the attachment hardware connected to the webbing.

The length of the assembly loop shall then be adjusted by applying a force between 89 and 98 N to the free end of the webbing at the buckle, or by the retraction force of an automatic-locking or emergency-locking retractor. A seat belt assembly that cannot be adjusted to this length shall be adjusted as closely as possible. An automatic-locking or emergency locking retractor when included in a seat belt assembly shall be locked at the start of the test with a tension on the webbing slightly in excess of the retractive force in order to keep the retractor locked.

If there is insufficient webbing on either side of the cut to make such a test for breaking strength, another seat belt assembly shall be used with the webbing repositioned in the hardware. A tensile force of 11,120 111 N shall be applied to the components or a force of 22,241 222 N shall be applied to the assembly loop.

The force shall be reduced to 334 22 N and the buckle release force measured as prescribed in S5.2(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any component of the seat belt assembly common to both pelvic and upper torso restraint shall be subjected to a tensile force of 13,344 134 N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> After the buckle is released in tests of pelvic and upper torso restraints, the webbing shall be examined for cutting by the hardware. If the yarns are partially or completely severed in a line for a distance of 10 percent or more of the webbing width, the cut webbing shall be tested for breaking strength as specified in S5.1(b) locating the cut in the free length between grips. If there is insufficient webbing on either side of the cut to make such a test for breaking strength, another seat belt assembly shall be used with the webbing repositioned in the hardware. The force applied shall be 11,120 111 N for components of pelvic restraint, and 6,672 67 N for components of upper torso restraint. After the force is removed, the breaking strength of the cut webbing shall be determined as prescribed above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a Type 2 seat belt assembly includes an automatic-locking retractor or an emergency-locking retractor the webbing and retractor shall be subjected to a tensile force of 11,120 111 N with the webbing fully extended from the retractor, or to a tensile force of 6,672 67 N with the webbing fully extended from the retractor if the design of the assembly permits only upper torso restraint forces on the retractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a seat belt assembly has a buckle in which the tongue is capable of inverted insertion, one of the three assemblies shall be tested with the tongue inverted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Resistance to buckle abrasion. Seat belt assemblies shall be tested for resistance to abrasion by each buckle or manual adjusting device normally used to adjust the size of the assembly. The webbing of the assembly to be used in this test shall be exposed for 4 hours to an atmosphere having relative humidity of 65 per cent and temperature of 18 [deg]C. The webbing shall be pulled back and forth through the buckle or manual adjusting device as shown schematically in Figure 7. The anchor end of the webbing (A) shall be attached to a mass (B) of 1.4 kg. The webbing shall pass through the buckle (C), and the other end (D) shall be attached to a reciprocating device so that the webbing forms an angle of 8[deg] with the hinge stop (E). The reciprocating device shall be operated for 2,500 cycles at a rate of 18 cycles per minute with a stroke length of 203 mm. The abraded webbing shall be tested for breaking strength by the procedure described in paragraph S5.1(b).</p><p class="depth0">S5.4 Tolerances on angles. Unless a range of angles is specified or a tolerance is otherwise explicitly provided, all angles and orientations of seat belt assemblies and components specified in this standard shall have a tolerance of 3 degrees.
