                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. HUD will review the performance of each grantee in carrying out its responsibilities under this part whenever determined necessary by HUD, but at least annually. In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the grantee's records and reports, findings from onsite monitoring, audit reports, and information generated from the disbursement and information system established by HUD. Where applicable, HUD may also consider relevant information pertaining to a grantee's performance gained from other sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and litigation. Reviews to determine compliance with specific requirements of this part will be conducted as necessary, with or without prior notice to the grantee. Onsite comprehensive performance reviews under the standards in paragraph (b) of this section will be conducted after prior notice to the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for comprehensive performance review. A grantee's performance will be comprehensively reviewed periodically, as prescribed by HUD, to determine whether the grantee has committed and expended the HTF funds as required by Sec. 93.400; has met the requirements of this part, particularly eligible activities, income targeting, affordability, and property standards; has awarded the funds in accordance with its HTF allocation plan and requirements of this part; has reviewed its subgrantees and recipients to determine whether they have satisfied the requirements of this part and the terms of their written agreements; and has met its performance measures in its consolidated plan.</p>
