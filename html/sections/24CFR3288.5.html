                            <p class="depth0">Retailer notice at the time of signing. At the time of signing a  contract for sale or lease for a manufactured home, the retailer must  provide the purchaser with a retailer notice. This notice may be in a  separate document from the sales contract or may be incorporated clearly  in a separate section on consumer dispute resolution information at the  top of the sales contract. The notice must include the following  language:</p><p class="depth0">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program is available to resolve  disputes among manufacturers, retailers, or installers concerning  defects in manufactured homes. Many states also have a consumer  assistance or dispute resolution program. For additional information  about these programs, see sections titled ``Dispute Resolution Process''  and ``Additional Information--HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution  Program'' in the Consumer Manual required to be provided to the  purchaser. These programs are not warranty programs and do not replace  the manufacturer's, or any other person's, warranty program.</p>
