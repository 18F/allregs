A copy of the findings shall be forwarded to the Senior Procurement Executive at the time of approval. If prolonged coverage is necessary, a letter contract shall be issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All pre-contract cost authorizations shall be reviewed and approved at a management level above the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retroactive precontract cost authorization and the predating of contractual agreements shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pre-contract cost authorizations shall not authorize the delivery or furnishing of any goods or services from a contractor until after the contract is executed.
