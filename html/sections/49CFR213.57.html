                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The maximum elevation of the outside rail of a curve may not be  more than 8 inches on track Classes 1 and 2, and 7 inches on track  Classes 3 through 5. The outside rail of a curve may not be lower than  the inside rail by design, except when engineered to address specific  track or operating conditions; the limits in Sec. 213.63 apply in all  cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The maximum allowable posted timetable operating speed for each  curve is determined by the following formula-- [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MR13.007  Where--  Vmax = Maximum allowable posted timetable operating speed</p><p class="depth2"><em>(m.p.h.)</em>. Ea = Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches).\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Actual elevation, Ea, for each 155-foot track segment  in the body of the curve is determined by averaging the elevation for 11  points through the segment at 15.5-foot spacing. If the curve length is  less than 155 feet, the points are averaged through the full length of  the body of the curve. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Eu = Qualified cant deficiency \2\ (inches) of the vehicle</p><p class="depth2">type. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ If the actual elevation, Ea, and degree of curvature,  D, change as a result of track degradation, then the actual cant  deficiency for the maximum allowable posted timetable operating speed,  Vmax, may be greater than the qualified cant deficiency,  Eu. This actual cant deficiency for each curve may not exceed  the qualified cant deficiency, Eu, plus 1 inch.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">D = Degree of curvature (degrees).\3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Degree of curvature, D, is determined by averaging the degree of  curvature over the same track segment as the elevation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All vehicles are considered qualified for operating on track  with a cant deficiency, Eu, not exceeding 3 inches. Table 1  of appendix A to this part is a table of speeds computed in accordance  with the formula in paragraph (b) of this section, when Eu  equals 3 inches, for various elevations and degrees of curvature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em>  or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When positioned on a track with a uniform superelevation equal  to the proposed cant deficiency:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No wheel of the vehicle type unloads to a value less than 60  percent of its static value on perfectly level track; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For passenger cars, the roll angle between the floor of the  equipment and the horizontal does not exceed 8.6 degrees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When operating through a constant radius curve at a constant  speed corresponding to the proposed cant deficiency, and a test plan is  submitted to and approved by FRA in accordance with Sec. 213.345(e) and  (f):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The steady-state (average) load on any wheel, throughout the  body of the curve, is not less than 60 percent of its static value on  perfectly level track; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For passenger cars, the steady-state (average) lateral  acceleration measured on the floor of the carbody does not exceed 0.15g.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The track owner or railroad shall transmit the results of the  testing specified in paragraph (d) of this section to FRA's Associate  Administrator for Railroad Safety/Chief Safety Officer (FRA) requesting  approval for the vehicle type to operate at the desired curving speeds  allowed under the formula in paragraph (b) of this section. The request  shall be made in writing and contain, at a minimum, the following  information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the vehicle type involved, including schematic  diagrams of the suspension system(s) and the estimated location of the  center of gravity above top of rail;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test procedure,\4\ including the load condition under which  the testing was performed, and description of the instrumentation used  to qualify the vehicle type, as well as the maximum values for wheel  unloading and roll angles or accelerations that were observed during  testing; and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\4\ The test procedure may be conducted whereby all the wheels on  one side (right or left) of the vehicle are raised to the proposed cant  deficiency, the vertical wheel loads under each wheel are measured, and  a level is used to record the angle through which the floor of the  vehicle has been rotated. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For vehicle types not subject to parts 229 or 238 of this  chapter, procedures or standards in effect that relate to the  maintenance of all safety-critical components of the suspension  system(s) for the particular vehicle type. Safety-critical components of  the suspension system are those that impact or have significant  influence on the roll of the carbody and the distribution of weight on  the wheels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In approving the request made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this  section, FRA may impose conditions necessary for safely operating at the  higher curving speeds. Upon FRA approval of the request, the track owner  or railroad shall notify FRA in writing no less than 30 calendar days  prior to the proposed implementation of the approved higher curving  speeds allowed under the formula in paragraph (b) of this section. The  notification shall contain, at a minimum, identification of the track  segment(s) on which the higher curving speeds are to be implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The documents required by this section must be provided to FRA  by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The track owner; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A railroad that provides service with the same vehicle type over  trackage of one or more track owner(s), with the written consent of each  affected track owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicle types permitted by FRA to operate at cant  deficiencies, Eu, greater than 3 inches but not more than 5  inches shall be considered qualified under this section to operate at  those permitted cant deficiencies for any track segment. The track owner  or railroad shall notify FRA in writing no less than 30 calendar days  prior to the proposed implementation of such curving speeds in  accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle types permitted by FRA to operate at cant deficiencies,  Eu, greater than 5 inches shall be considered qualified under  this section to operate at those permitted cant deficiencies only for  the previously operated or identified track segments(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For vehicle types intended to operate at any curving speed  producing more than 5 inches of cant deficiency, the following  provisions of subpart G of this part shall apply: Secs. 213.333(a)  through (g), (j)(1), (k) and (m), 213.345, and 213.369(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicle means a locomotive, as defined in Sec. 229.5 of this  chapter; a freight car, as defined in Sec. 215.5 of this chapter; a  passenger car, as defined in Sec. 238.5 of this chapter; and any rail  rolling equipment used in a train with either a freight car or a  passenger car.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle type means like vehicles with variations in their  physical properties, such as suspension, mass, interior arrangements,  and dimensions that do not result in significant changes to their  dynamic characteristics.
