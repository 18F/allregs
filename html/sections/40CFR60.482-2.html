A pump that begins operation in light liquid service after the initial startup date for the process unit must be monitored for the first time within 30 days after the end of its startup period, except for a pump that replaces a leaking pump and except as provided in Sec. 60.482-1(c) and (f) and paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each pump in light liquid service shall be monitored monthly to detect leaks by the methods specified in Sec. 60.485(b), except as provided in Sec. 60.482-1(c) and (f) and paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.
