(1) On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's revised statutory penalty levels which are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's revised statutory penalty levels which are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Voluntary Protection Program. On June 24, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's plan supplement, which is generally identical to the Federal STAR Voluntary Protection Program. South Carolina's ``Palmetto'' VPP is limited to the STAR Program in general industry, excludes the MERIT AND DEMONSTRATION Programs and excludes the construction industry. Also, injury rates must be at or below 50 percent of the State industry average rather than the National industry average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary labor camps/field sanitation. Effective February 3, 1997, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's plan amendment, dated August 1, 1996, relinquishing coverage for the issues of field sanitation (29 CFR 1928.110) and temporary labor camps (29 CFR 1910.142) in agriculture (except for agricultural temporary labor camps associated with egg, poultry or red meat production, or the post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.) The Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, has assumed responsibility for enforcement of these Federal OSHA standards in agriculture in South Carolina pursuant to Secretary of Labor's Order 5-96, dated December 27, 1996.
