                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Years to which loss may be carried. In order to  compute the operations loss deduction of a life insurance company the  company must first determine the part of any losses   from operations for any preceding or succeeding taxable years which are  carryovers or carrybacks to the taxable year in issue. Except as  otherwise provided by this paragraph, a loss from operations for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1954, shall be carried back to each  of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be carried  forward to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year. Except  as limited by section 812(e)(2) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.812-6, if  the life insurance company is a new company (as defined in section  812(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em> for the loss year, the loss from operations shall be carried  back to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be  carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years succeeding the loss year.  In determining the span of years for which a loss from operations may be  carried, taxable years in which a company does not qualify as a life  insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)), or is not treated as a  new company, shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special transitional rules. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A loss from operations for any  taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958, shall not be carried back  to any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1955. Furthermore, a  loss from operations for any taxable year beginning after December 31,  1957, shall not be carried back to any taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1958.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If for any taxable year a life insurance company has made an  election under section 810(e) (relating to certain decreases in reserves  for voluntary employees' beneficiary associations) which is effective  for such taxable year, the provisions of section 812(b)(1) and  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any  loss from operations for any taxable year beginning before January 1,  1958.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 812(b)(1)  and of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. P, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a  loss from operations of $1,000 in 1958. This loss cannot be carried  back, but shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years  following 1958.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Q, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a  loss from operations of $1,200 in 1959. This loss shall be carried back  to the taxable year 1958 and then shall be carried forward to each of  the 5 taxable years following 1959.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. R, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a  loss from operations of $1,300 for the taxable year 1956. This loss  shall first be carried back to the taxable year 1955 and then shall be  carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years following 1956. The loss  for 1956, carryback to 1955, and carryover to 1957 shall each be  computed as if part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (as in effect  for 1958) applied to such taxable years.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. S, a life insurance company, organized in 1958 and  meeting the provisions of section 812(e) (rules relating to new  companies), has a loss from operations of $1,400 for the taxable year  1958. This loss cannot be carried back, but shall be carried forward to  each of the 8 taxable years following 1958, provided, however, S is not  a nonqualified corporation at any time during the loss year (1958) or  any taxable year thereafter.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. T, a life insurance company, organized in 1954 and  meeting the provisions of section 812(e) (rules relating to new  companies), has a loss from operations of $1,500 for the taxable year  1956. This loss shall first be carried back to the taxable year 1955 and  then carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years following 1956,  provided, however, T is not a nonqualified corporation at any time  during the loss year (1956) or any taxable year thereafter. The loss for  1956, carryback to 1955, and carryover to 1957 shall each be computed as  if part I of subchapter L (as in effect for 1958) applied to such  taxable years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Periods of less than 12 months. A fractional part of a year  which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) is a  preceding or a succeeding taxable year for the purpose of determining  under section 812 the first, second, etc., preceding or succeeding  taxable year. For the determination of the loss from operations for  periods of less than 12 months, see section 818(d) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Amount of loss to be carried. The amount which is carried back  or carried over to any taxable year is the loss from operations to the  extent it was not absorbed in the computation of gain from operations  for other taxable years, preceding such taxable year, to which it may be  carried back or carried over. For the purpose of determining the gain  from operations for any such preceding taxable year, the various  operations loss carryovers and carrybacks to such taxable year are  considered to be applied in reduction of   the gain from operations in the order of the taxable years from which  such losses are carried over or carried back, beginning with the loss  for the earliest taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Corporate acquisitions. For the computation of the operations  loss carryovers in the case of certain acquisitions of the assets of a  life insurance company by another life insurance company, see section  381(c)(22) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Portion of loss from operations which is a carryback or a  carryover to the taxable year in issue--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manner of computation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A  loss from operations shall first be carried back to the earliest taxable  year permissible under section 812(b) and paragraph (a) of this section  for which such loss is allowable as a carryback or a carryover. The  entire amount of the loss from operation shall be carried back to such  earliest year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 812(b)(2) provides that the portion of the loss from  operations which shall be carried to each of the taxable years  subsequent to the earliest taxable year shall be the excess (if any) of  the amount of the loss from operations over the sum of the offsets (as  defined in section 812(d) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.812-5) for all  prior taxable years to which the loss from operations may be carried.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Illustration of principles. The application of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. T, a life insurance company (which is not a new company as  defined in section 812(e)(1)), has a loss from operations for 1960. The  entire amount of the loss from operations for 1960 shall first be  carried back to 1958. The amount of the carryback to 1959 is the excess  (if any) of the 1960 loss over the offset for 1958. The amount of the  carryover to 1961 is the excess (if any) of the 1960 loss over the sum  of the offsets for 1958 and 1959. The amount of the 1960 loss remaining  (if any) to be carried over to 1962, 1963, or 1964 shall be computed in  a like manner.  [T.D. 6535, 26 FR 537, Jan. 20, 1961]</p>
