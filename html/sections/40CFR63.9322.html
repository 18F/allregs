                            <p class="depth0">You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to  determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by  Sec. 63.9310.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> and (2) of this section are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix  M to 40 CFR part 51 for a potential to emit (PTE) and directs all the  exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All engine test operations creating exhaust gases for which the  test is applicable are conducted within the capture system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measuring capture efficiency. If the capture system does not  meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you  must use one of the   two protocols described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to  measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use  total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) capture efficiency as a surrogate for  organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocol in paragraph (c) of  this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three  test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours in duration or the  length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the  purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a  single engine test to go from the beginning to the end.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (5) of this  section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to- gas protocol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around  the engine test cell/stand and all areas where emissions from the engine  testing subsequently occur. The enclosure must meet the applicable  definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in  Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to  measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission  capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at  the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement,  substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to  40 CFR part 51 measurement must be upstream from the add-on control  device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system  and entering the add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the  add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions  entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in  each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device  must be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to  measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by  the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the  temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture  efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each  occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure  is a temporary total enclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the  enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency  measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the  building enclosure, other than the engine test cell/stand operation for  which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all  fans and blowers must be operating normally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent  capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 1 of  this section: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.004  Where:  CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the</p><p class="depth0">add-on control device, percent TVHcaptured = total mass of TVH captured by the emission</p><p class="depth0">capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control</p><p class="depth0">device during the emission capture efficiency</p><p class="depth0">test run, kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(2) of this</p><p class="depth0">section TVHuncaptured = total mass of TVH that is not captured by the</p><p class="depth0">emission capture system and that exits from the temporary</p><p class="depth0">total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture</p><p class="depth0">efficiency test run, kg, determined according to paragraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determine the capture efficiency the emission capture system as  the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternative capture efficiency protocol. As an alternative to  the procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you may  determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol  and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality  objective or lower control limit approach as described in appendix A to  subpart KK of this part.</p>
