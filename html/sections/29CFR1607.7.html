                            <p class="depth0">A. Validity studies not conducted by the user. Users may, under  certain circumstances, support the use of selection procedures by  validity studies conducted by other users or conducted by   test publishers or distributors and described in test manuals. While  publishers of selection procedures have a professional obligation to  provide evidence of validity which meets generally accepted professional  standards (see section 5C above), users are cautioned that they are  responsible for compliance with these guidelines. Accordingly, users  seeking to obtain selection procedures from publishers and distributors  should be careful to determine that, in the event the user becomes  subject to the validity requirements of these guidelines, the necessary  information to support validity has been determined and will be made  available to the user.</p><p class="depth0">B. Use of criterion-related validity evidence from other sources.  Criterion-related validity studies conducted by one test user, or  described in test manuals and the professional literature, will be  considered acceptable for use by another user when the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Validity evidence. Evidence from the available studies meeting  the standards of section 14B below clearly demonstrates that the  selection procedure is valid;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Job similarity. The incumbents in the user's job and the  incumbents in the job or group of jobs on which the validity study was  conducted perform substantially the same major work behaviors, as shown  by appropriate job analyses both on the job or group of jobs on which  the validity study was performed and on the job for which the selection  procedure is to be used; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fairness evidence. The studies include a study of test fairness  for each race, sex, and ethnic group which constitutes a significant  factor in the borrowing user's relevant labor market for the job or jobs  in question. If the studies under consideration satisfy paragraphs (1)  and (2) of this paragraph B.,\1/4\ above but do not contain an  investigation of test fairness, and it is not technically feasible for  the borrowing user to conduct an internal study of test fairness, the  borrowing user may utilize the study until studies conducted elsewhere  meeting the requirements of these guidelines show test unfairness, or  until such time as it becomes technically feasible to conduct an  internal study of test fairness and the results of that study can be  acted upon. Users obtaining selection procedures from publishers should  consider, as one factor in the decision to purchase a particular  selection procedure, the availability of evidence concerning test  fairness.</p><p class="depth2">C. Validity evidence from multiunit study. if validity evidence from  a study covering more than one unit within an organization statisfies  the requirements of section 14B below, evidence of validity specific to  each unit will not be required unless there are variables which are  likely to affect validity significantly.</p><p class="depth2">D. Other significant variables. If there are variables in the other  studies which are likely to affect validity significantly, the user may  not rely upon such studies, but will be expected either to conduct an  internal validity study or to comply with section 6 above.</p>
