                            <p class="depth0">The Act of June 15, 1955 (Pub. L. 74, 84th Cong., 69 Stat. 134),  provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prepaid income.  Section 452 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is hereby repealed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reserves for estimated expenses, etc. Section 462 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is hereby repealed.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 2. Technical amendments. The following provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 are hereby amended as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subsection (c) of section 381 is amended by striking out  paragraph (7) (relating to carryover of prepaid income in certain  corporate acquisitions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The table of sections for subpart B of part II of subchapter E  of chapter 1 (relating to taxable year for which items of gross income  included) is amended by striking out</p><p class="depth0">``Sec. 452. Prepaid income.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The table of sections for subpart C of such part II (relating to  taxable year for which deductions are taken) is amended by striking out:</p><p class="depth0">``Sec. 462. Reserves for estimated expenses, etc.''</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 3. Effective date. The amendments made by this act shall apply  with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and  ending after August 16, 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Filing of statement. If:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the amount of any tax required to be paid for any taxable year  ending on or before the date of the enactment of this act is increased  by reason of the enactment of this act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the last date prescribed for payment of such tax (or any  installment thereof) is before December 15, 1955,  then the taxpayer shall, on or before December 15, 1955, file a  statement which shows the increase in the amount of such tax required to  be paid by reason of the enactment of this act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Form and effect of statement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form of statement, etc. The  statement required by subsection (a) shall be filed at the place fixed  for filing the return. Such statement shall be in such form, and shall  include such information necessary or appropriate to show the increase  in the amount of the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by  reason of the enactment of this act, as the Secretary of the Treasury or  his delegate shall by regulations prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment as amount shown on return. The amount shown on a  statement filed under subsection (a) as the increase in the amount of  the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by reason of the  enactment of this act shall, for all purposes of the internal revenue  laws, be treated as tax shown on the return. Notwithstanding the  preceding sentence, that portion of the amount of increase in tax for  any taxable year which is attributable to a decrease (by reason of the  enactment of this act) in the net operating loss for a succeeding  taxable year shall not be treated as tax shown on the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver of interest in case of payment on or before December 15,  1955. If the taxpayer, on or before December 15, 1955, files the  statement referred to in subsection (a) and pays in full that portion of  the amount shown thereon for which the last date prescribed for payment  is before December 15, 1955, then for purposes of computing interest  (other than interest on overpayments) such portion shall be treated as  having been paid on the last date prescribed for payment. This paragraph  shall not apply if the amount shown on the statement as the increase in  the amount of the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by reason  of the enactment of this act is greater than the actual increase unless  the taxpayer establishes, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the  Treasury or his delegate, that his computation of the greater amount was  based upon a reasonable interpretation and application of sections 452  and 462 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as those sections existed  before the enactment of this act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest for period before enactment.  Interest shall not be imposed on the amount of any increase in tax  resulting from the enactment of this act for any period before the day  after the date of the enactment of this act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Estimated tax. Any addition to the tax under section 294(d) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be computed as if this act   had not been enacted. In the case of any installment for which the last  date prescribed for payment is before December 15, 1955, any addition to  the tax under section 6654 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be  computed as if this act had not been enacted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of certain payments which taxpayer is required to  make. If:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer is required to make a payment (or an additional  payment) to another person by reason of the enactment of this act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 prescribes a period, which  expires after the close of the taxable year, within which the taxpayer  must make such payment (or additional payment) if the amount thereof is  to be taken into account (as a deduction or otherwise) in computing  taxable income for such taxable year,  then, subject to such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury or  his delegate may prescribe, if such payment (or additional payment) is  made on or before December 15, 1955, it shall be treated as having been  made within the period prescribed by such Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of certain dividends. Subject to such regulations as  the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate may prescribe, for  purposes of section 561(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,  dividends paid after the 15th day of the third month following the close  of the taxable year and on or before December 15, 1955, may be treated  as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year, but only to the  extent (A) that such dividends are attributable to an increase in  taxable income for the taxable year resulting from the enactment of this  act, and (B) elected by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determination of date prescribed. For purposes of this section,  the determination of the last date prescribed for payment or for filing  a return shall be made without regard to any extension of time therefor  and without regard to any provision of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Regulations. For requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury  or his delegate shall prescribe all rules and regulations as may be  necessary by reason of the enactment of this act, see section 7805(a) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>
