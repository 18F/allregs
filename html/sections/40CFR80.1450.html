To the extent practicable, the Risk Mitigation Plan should utilize a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to examine each phase of the pathway to identify spread reduction steps. BMPs should include the development of mitigation strategies and plans to minimize escape and other impacts (e.g., minimize soil disturbance), incorporate desirable traits (e.g., sterility or reduced seed production), develop and implement dispersal mitigation protocols prior to cultivation, develop multiple year eradication controls. Eradication controls should follow an approach of early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to unintended spread. EDRR efforts should demonstrate the likelihood that invasions will be halted while still localized and identify and employ cooperative networks, communication forums, and consultation processes with federal, state, and local agencies.
