                                Sec. 778.111  Pieceworker.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Piece rates and supplements generally. When an employee is  employed on a piece-rate basis, the regular hourly rate of pay is  computed by adding together total earnings for the workweek from piece  rates and all other sources (such as production bonuses) and any sums  paid for waiting time or other hours worked (except statutory  exclusions). This sum is then divided by the number of hours worked in  the week for which such compensation was paid, to yield the  pieceworker's ``regular rate'' for that week. For overtime work the  pieceworker is entitled to be paid, in addition to the total weekly  earnings at this regular rate for all hours worked, a sum equivalent to  one-half this regular rate of pay multiplied by the number of hours  worked in excess of 40 in the week. (For an alternative method of  complying with the overtime requirements of the Act as   far as pieceworkers are concerned, see Sec. 778.418.) Only additional  half-time pay is required in such cases where the employee has already  received straight-time compensation at piece rates or by supplementary  payments for all hours worked. Thus, for example, if the employee has  worked 50 hours and has earned $491 at piece rates for 46 hours of  productive work and in addition has been compensated at $8.00 an hour  for 4 hours of waiting time, the total compensation, $523.00, must be  divided by the total hours of work, 50, to arrive at the regular hourly  rate of pay--$10.46. For the 10 hours of overtime the employee is  entitled to additional compensation of $52.30 (10 hours at $5.23). For  the week's work the employee is thus entitled to a total of $575.30  (which is equivalent to 40 hours at $10.46 plus 10 overtime hours at  $15.69).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Piece rates with minimum hourly guarantee. In some cases an  employee is hired on a piece-rate basis coupled with a minimum hourly  guaranty. Where the total piece-rate earnings for the workweek fall  short of the amount that would be earned for the total hours of work at  the guaranteed rate, the employee is paid the difference. In such weeks  the employee is in fact paid at an hourly rate and the minimum hourly  guaranty is the regular rate in that week. In the example just given, if  the employee was guaranteed $11 an hour for productive working time, the  employee would be paid $506 (46 hours at $11) for the 46 hours of  productive work (instead of the $491 earned at piece rates). In a week  in which no waiting time was involved, the employee would be owed an  additional $5.50 (half time) for each of the 6 overtime hours worked, to  bring the total compensation up to $539 (46 hours at $11 plus 6 hours at  $5.50 or 40 hours at $11 plus 6 hours at $16.50). If the employee is  paid at a different rate for waiting time, the regular rate is the  weighted average of the 2 hourly rates, as discussed in Sec. 778.115.  [76 FR 18857, Apr. 5, 2011]</p>
