Less than an  entire State may be designated as a commercial citrus-producing area  only if the Administrator determines that the area not included as a  commercial citrus-producing area does not contain commercial citrus  plantings; that the State has adopted and is enforcing a prohibition on  the intrastate movement from areas not designated as commercial citrus- producing areas to commercial citrus-producing areas of fruit which are  designated as regulated articles and which were moved interstate from a  quarantined State pursuant to a limited permit; and that the designation  of less than the entire State as a commercial citrus-producing area will  otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker.
