Appendix A to Subpart J of Part 838--Guidelines for Interpreting</p><p class="depth0">State Court Orders Dividing Civil Service Retirement Benefits</p><p class="depth0">United States of America</p><p class="depth0">Office of Personnel Management</p><p class="depth0">Retirement and Insurance Group</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Dividing Civil Service</p><p class="depth0">Retirement Benefits</p><p class="depth0">These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently  used in dividing benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for  the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the  hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner in which  OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the resulting orders  will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish  the aims of the court.</p><p class="depth0">A substantial number of State court orders are drafted under the  mistaken belief that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)  (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) applies to CSRS benefits. Sections 1003(b)(1)  and 1051 of title 29, United States Code, exempt CSRS from ERISA,  because CSRS is a ``governmental plan'' as defined in section 1001(23)  of title 29, United States Code. Accordingly, OPM does not honor ERISA  Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders (QDRO's) except to the extent that  the law governing CSRS expressly authorizes compliance with State court  orders. OPM will honor the orders to the extent permitted by CSRS.  However, many provisions of ERISA QDRO's are not authorized under CSRS.  Most significantly, a court cannot require that payments to the former  spouse begin before the employee actually retires (i.e., begins to  receive benefits) and, unless the order expressly provides that the  former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity, the payments to the  former spouse cannot continue after the employee dies.</p><p class="depth0">I. Computations generally</p><p class="depth0">A. Adjustments affecting court-awarded benefits. 1. Orders that  award adjustments to a former spouse stated in terms such as ``cost-of- living adjustments'' or ``COLAs'' occurring after the date of the decree  but before the date of retirement will be interpreted to award increases  equal to the adjustments described in or effected under section 8340 of  title 5, United States Code.</p><p class="depth0">2. Orders that award adjustments to a former spouse stated in terms  such as ``salary adjustments'' or ``pay adjustments'' occurring after  the date of the decree will be interpreted to award increases equal to  the adjustments described in or effected under section 5303 of title 5,  United States Code until the date of retirement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unless otherwise specified in the order, adjustments described in  section 8340 of title 5, United States Code will be applied after the  date of retirement.</p><p class="depth0">B. Application of COLAs. 1. Unless the court directly and  unequivocally orders otherwise, decrees that divide annuities either on  a percentage basis or by use of a formula will be interpreted to entitle  the former spouse to salary adjustments occurring after the date of the  decree and cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the  decree or occurring after the date of the employee's retirement,  whichever comes later.</p><p class="depth0">2. On the other hand, decrees that award a former spouse a specific  dollar amount from the annuity will be interpreted as excluding salary  and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of the decree, unless the  court expressly orders their inclusion.</p><p class="depth0">3. Orders that contain a general instruction to calculate the former  spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation will not  be interpreted to prevent the inclusion of salary adjustments occurring  after the specified date. To prevent the application of salary  adjustments after the date of the divorce or separation, the decree must  either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse  or specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified date  are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share.</p><p class="depth0">4. Orders that require OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified  date, and specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified  date are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share will  not be interpreted to prevent the application of COLAs after the date of  the Federal employee's retirement. To award COLAs between the specified  date and the Federal employee's retirement, the order must specifically  state that the former spouse will receive the benefit of any COLAs  occurring between the specified date and the date of the Federal  employee's retirement. To prevent the application of COLAs after the  retirement date, the decree must either state the exact dollar amount of  the award to the former spouse or specifically state that the former  spouse will not receive the benefit of COLAs occurring after the date of  the Federal employee's retirement.</p><p class="depth0">C. Present value. 1. Orders that award a portion of the ``present  value'' of an annuity will not be honored unless the amount of the  ``present value'' is stated in the order. (See 5 CFR 838.1004(b).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Orders that award a portion of the ``present value'' of an  annuity stated in the   order will be interpreted as awarding ``a specific dollar amount.''  Unless the court specifically states otherwise, such an award payable  from a monthly annuity benefit will be paid in equal installments at 50  percent of the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement or the  date of the order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar  amount is reached.</p><p class="depth0">3. Orders that award a portion of the ``value'' of an annuity as of  a specific date before retirement, without specifying what ``value'' is,  will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the  monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the  numerator of which is the number of months of ``creditable service'' or  service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is  the total number of months as of the time of retirement of ``creditable  service'' or service worked, whichever term is used in the court order.  (See III. C. of these Guidelines.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Orders that contain general language awarding a specified portion  of a Federal employee's ``retirement benefits'' as of a specified date  before retirement, but do not specify whether OPM should use  ``creditable service'' or ``service worked'' as of the date specified to  complete the computation, will be interpreted to award a portion of the  annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement  times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of  service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is  the number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the time of  retirement.</p><p class="depth0">D. Annuity as of a date before retirement. Orders that award a  portion of an employee's annuity as of a specified date before the  employee's retirement will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the  annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement  times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of  ``creditable service'' or service worked as of the date specified and  the denominator of which is the number of months of ``creditable  service'' or service worked used in the retirement computation.</p><p class="depth0">E. Formulas or percentage instructions. Orders that contain both a  formula or percentage instruction and a dollar amount will be  interpreted as including the dollar amount only as the court's estimate  of the initial amount of payment. The formula or percentage instruction  will control.</p><p class="depth0">F. Computation limited to a particular period of employment. In  order to limit the computation of benefits to a particular period of  employment, the court order must use language expressly limiting the  period of service to be included in the computation. General language  such as ``benefits accrued as a result of employment with the U.S.  Postal Service * * *'' will be interpreted to mean only that CSRS  retirement benefits are subject to division (see V.A. of appendix A to  subpart J of part 838). Such language will not be interpreted to limit  the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service  performed with other Government agencies will be included). To limit the  period of service, the court order should specify the number of months  to be included in the computation or should describe specifically the  period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., ``only U.S.  Postal Service'' or ``exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal  Service employment'' or ``only service performed during the period  Petitioner and Defendant were married'' or ``benefits based on service  performed through the date of divorce,'' etc.).</p><p class="depth0">G. Amounts less than $12 per year. Orders awarding a former spouse  less than $12 per year are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be  interpreted as an award of $1 per month.</p><p class="depth0">II. Types of annuity</p><p class="depth0">A. Gross annuity will be interpreted as the amount of the annuity  payable after any applicable survivor reduction but before any other  deduction.</p><p class="depth0">B. 1. To divide an annuity before any applicable survivor reduction,  the decree must contain language to the effect that the division is to  be made on the self-only annuity, the life-rate annuity, or the annuity  unreduced for survivor benefit, or equivalent language. A division of  ``gross annuity'' will not accomplish this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">2. To divide an annuity before the social security offset under  section 8349 of title 5, United States Code, the order must expressly  state that the division is to occur before the social security offset.  The term ``unreduced annuity'' will mean annuity after the social  security offset.</p><p class="depth0">C. Net annuity or disposable annuity will be interpreted to mean net  annuity as defined in Sec. 838.1003.</p><p class="depth0">D. Orders that fail to state the type of annuity that they are  dividing will be interpreted as dividing gross annuity (defined above).</p><p class="depth0">E. Orders dividing a ``retirement check'' will be interpreted as  dividing net annuity (as defined in Sec. 838.1003).</p><p class="depth0">III. Calculating time</p><p class="depth0">A. The smallest unit of time that will be used in computing a  formula in a decree is a month.</p><p class="depth0">1. This policy is based on section 8332 of title 5, United States  Code, that allows credit for service for years or twelfth parts thereof.  Requests to calculate smaller units of time will not be honored.</p><p class="depth0">2. Time calculations by the Office of Personnel Management will be  no more precise   than years and twelfth parts, even where the court order directs OPM to  make a more precise calculation. However, if the court order states a  formula using a specified simple or decimal fraction other than twelfth  parts, OPM will use the specified number to perform simple mathematical  computations. For example, the share of a former spouse awarded a  portion of the annuity equal to \1/2\ of the fraction whose numerator is  12.863 years and whose denominator is the total service on which the  annuity is based would be computed by taking \1/2\ of the quotient  obtained by dividing 12.863 by the total service measured in years and  twelfth parts.</p><p class="depth0">B. The term ``military service'' will generally be interpreted to  include only periods of service within the definition of military  service contained in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code,  i.e., active duty military service. Civilian service with military  organizations will not be included as ``military service,'' except where  the exclusion of such civilian service would be manifestly contrary to  the intent of the court order.</p><p class="depth0">C. 1. Unused sick leave is counted as ``creditable service'' on the  date of separation for immediate retirement; it is not apportioned over  the time when earned.</p><p class="depth0">2. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that  requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior to  separation and using terms such as ``years of service,'' ``total  service,'' or similar terms, the time attributable to unused sick leave  will not be included.</p><p class="depth0">3. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that  requires a computation of ``creditable service'' (or some other phrase  using ``credit'' or its equivalent) as of a date prior to retirement,  unused sick leave will be included in the computation as follows--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the order will  be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly  annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the  number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the date specified plus  the number of months of unused sick leave specified and whose  denominator is the months of ``creditable service'' used in the  retirement computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(ii)</em> If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the order  will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the  monthly rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator  of which is the number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the  date specified (no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the  number of months of ``creditable service'' used in the retirement  computation.</p><p class="depth2">IV. Distinguishing Between Divisions of Annuity and Refunds of</p><p class="depth2">Contributions</p><p class="depth2">A. Orders that are unclear about whether they are dividing an  annuity or a refund of contributions will be interpreted as dividing an  annuity.</p><p class="depth2">B. Orders using ``annuities,'' ``pensions,'' ``retirement  benefits,'' or similar terms will be interpreted as dividing an annuity  and whatever other employee benefits become payable, such as refunds.  Orders using ``contributions,'' ``deductions,'' ``deposits,''  ``retirement accounts,'' ``retirement fund,'' or similar terms will be  interpreted as dividing the amount of contributions the employee has  paid into the Civil Service Retirement Fund. Unless the court order  specifically states otherwise, when an annuity is payable, such orders  will be paid in equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the monthly  annuity at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever  comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.</p><p class="depth2">V. Identifying Benefits Affected</p><p class="depth2">A. Orders that do not specify what pension or retirement benefits  are to be divided will not be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits.  Terms such as ``CSRS,'' ``United States,'' ``OPM,'' ``Federal  Government'' benefits, ``Postal Service retirement benefits,''  ``retirement benefits payable based on service with the U.S. Department  of Agriculture,'' or similar terms will be considered sufficient to  identify civil service retirement benefits for division.</p><p class="depth2">B. Except as provided below, orders directed at other retirement  systems will not be interpreted as affecting CSRS benefits.</p><p class="depth2">1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employees  Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as dividing CSRS  benefits and vice versa.</p><p class="depth2">2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees  transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be  interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the  CSRS component, if any.</p><p class="depth2">C. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as  military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central  Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as  dividing CSRS benefits.</p><p class="depth2">D. Orders dividing military retired pay, even when military retired  pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be  interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits. (Such orders cannot be qualifying  orders under section 838.1004(b), because the amount cannot be computed  from the face of the order or from normal OPM files.)</p><p class="depth2">VI. State Law not Specified in Court Orders</p><p class="depth2">A. 1. Except as provided in Guideline VI.A.2., OPM will not  research, interpret, or   apply State law regarding community or marital property rights or  divisions.</p><p class="depth2">2. OPM will not divide disability retirement benefits when such a  division would be contrary to State law unless the order expressly  directs division of ``disability'' benefits.</p><p class="depth2">B. Orders that do not specify the ``community property'' fraction or  percentage of the former spouse's share will not be considered  qualifying because the amount of the benefit cannot be computed from the  face of the order or from normal OPM files (5 CFR 838.1004(b)).  [55 FR 9103, Mar. 12, 1990. Redesignated and amended at 57 FR 33596,  July 29, 1992]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix B to Subpart J of Part 838--Guidelines for Interpreting</p><p class="depth2">State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses</p><p class="depth2">United States of America</p><p class="depth2">Office of Personnel Management</p><p class="depth2">Retirement and Insurance Group  Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity</p><p class="depth2">Benefits to Former Spouses</p><p class="depth2">These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently  used in awarding survivor benefits. These guidelines are intended not  only for the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole,  with the hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner  in which OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the  resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper  language to accomplish the aims of the court.</p><p class="depth2">I. Insurable Interest Annuities</p><p class="depth2">Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by  retiring employees to cover former spouses. Section 8341(h) of title 5,  United States Code, provides for ``former spouse annuities.'' Section  8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides for ``insurable  interest annuities.'' These are distinct benefits, each with its own  advantages.</p><p class="depth2">A. OPM will enforce State court orders to provide section 8341(h)  annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have fewer  restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former spouse's  interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before age 55. To  provide a section 8341(h) annuity, the order must use terms such as  ``former spouse annuity,'' ``section 8341(h) annuity,'' or ``survivor  annuity.''</p><p class="depth2">B. OPM will not enforce State court orders to provide ``insurable  interest annuities'' under section 8339(k). These annuities may only be  elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is not  retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in good  health. The retiree may also elect to cancel the insurable interest  annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after  retirement. The parties might seek to provide this type of annuity  interest if the non-employee spouse expects to remarry before age 55, if  the employee expects to remarry a younger second spouse before  retirement, or if another former spouse has already been awarded a  section 8341(h) annuity. However, the State court will have to provide  its own remedy if the employee is not eligible for or does not make the  election. OPM will not enforce the order. Language including the words  ``insurable interest'' or referring to section 8339(k) will be  interpreted as providing for this type of survivor benefit.</p><p class="depth2">C. In orders which contain internal contradictions about the type of  annuity, such as ``insurable interest annuity under section 8341(h),''  the section reference will control.</p><p class="depth2">II. Orders Directed at Other Retirement Systems</p><p class="depth2">A. Except as provided in paragraphs A1 and A2, orders directed at  other retirement systems will not be interpreted as affecting Civil  Service Retirement System (CSRS) benefits.</p><p class="depth2">1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employee's  Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as affecting CSRS  benefits and vice versa.</p><p class="depth2">2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees  transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be  interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the  CSRS component, if any.</p><p class="depth2">B. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as  military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central  Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as  awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS. Thus, orders should contain  language identifying the retirement system from which survivor benefits  are being awarded. For example, orders should contain terms such as  ``CSRS,'' ``OPM,'' ``Federal Government employee survivor benefits,'' or  ``survivor benefits payable based on service with the U. S. Department  of Agriculture,'' etc.</p><p class="depth2">C. Orders affecting military retired pay, even when military retired  pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be  interpreted as awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS.</p><p class="depth2">III. Specificity Required To Award a Former Spouse Annuity.</p><p class="depth2">A. Orders must contain language identifying the benefits affected.  For example, ``CSRS,'' ``OPM,'' or ``Federal Government'' survivor  benefits, or ``survivor benefits payable based on service with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture,'' etc., will be considered sufficient  identification.</p><p class="depth2">B. 1. Except as provided paragraphs B2 through B4, orders must  specify the benefit being awarded. Orders must contain language such as  ``survivor annuity,'' ``death benefits,'' ``former spouse annuity under  5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1),'' etc.</p><p class="depth2">2. Orders that provide that the former spouse is to ``continue as''  or ``be named as'' the ``designated beneficiary'' of CSRS benefits will  be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</p><p class="depth2">3. Orders that provide that the former spouse will ``continue to  receive benefits after the death of'' the employee or ``that benefits  will continue after the death of'' the employee, but do not use terms  such as ``survivor annuity,'' ``death benefits,'' ``former spouse  annuity,'' or similar terms will not be interpreted to award a former  spouse annuity.</p><p class="depth2">4. Orders that give the former spouse the right to elect a former  spouse annuity will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity. The  former spouse does not have an election opportunity. OPM will not accept  an election by the former spouse to eliminate the court-awarded former  spouse annuity.</p><p class="depth2">C. 1. Orders that unequivocally award survivor annuity and direct  the former spouse to pay for that benefit are qualifying court orders.  If the former spouse has also been awarded a portion of the retiree's  benefits then the cost of the survivor benefit will be deducted from the  former spouse's portion of the annuity (if sufficient to cover the total  cost--there will be no partial withholding). Otherwise, the reduction  will be taken from the retiree's annuity and collection from the former  spouse will be a private matter between the parties.</p><p class="depth2">2. Orders that condition the award of survivor annuity on the former  spouse's payment of the cost of the benefit are qualifying only if there  is also an award of retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost.  Absent a sufficient award of employee retirement benefits to pay the  cost of survivor benefits, the order is not qualifying.</p><p class="depth2">D. Orders providing that former spouses will keep the survivor  annuity to which they were entitled at the time of the divorce will be  interpreted to award a former spouse annuity in the same amount as they  had at the time of divorce.</p><p class="depth2">E. Orders that fail to state the amount of the former spouse annuity  will be interpreted as providing the maximum former spouse annuity.</p><p class="depth2">F. Orders awarding a former spouse annuity of less than $12 per year  are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be interpreted to provide  an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living increases  occurring after the date of the order. The reduction in the retiree's  annuity will be computed as though the order provided a former spouse  annuity of $1 per month.</p><p class="depth2">G. Orders that provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former  spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may elect a  lesser benefit for the former spouse upon his or her remarriage will be  interpreted to provide only a full survivor annuity benefit to the  former spouse. In order to provide full survivor annuity benefits to a  former spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may  provide a lesser survivor annuity benefit to the former spouse in order  to provide survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse, the order  should allow a reduction in the former spouse benefit contingent upon  the employee's or annuitant's election of survivor annuity benefits for  a subsequent spouse. A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits  provided to the former spouse will not be permitted if it is contingent  upon the employee's or annuitant's remarriage rather than his or her  election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.
