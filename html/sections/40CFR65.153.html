(1) Owners or operators using a recovery device to meet the requirement to operate and maintain a TRE above 1.0 as specified in Sec. 65.63(a)(3) for process vents shall meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners or operators using a recovery device to meet the requirement to operate and maintain a TRE above 1.0 as specified in Sec. 65.63(a)(3) for process vents shall meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recovery devices used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions are vented to them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery device performance test requirements. (1) There are no performance test requirements for recovery devices. Records of TRE index value determination shall be generated as specified in Sec. 65.160(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are no performance test requirements for recovery devices. Records of TRE index value determination shall be generated as specified in Sec. 65.160(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Replace a final recovery device or control device. Unless already permitted by the applicable title V permit, if an owner or operator elects to use a recovery device to replace an existing final recovery or control device at a later date, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, either by amendment of the regulated source's title V permit or, if title V is not applicable, by submission of the notice specified in Sec. 65.167(a) before implementing the change. Upon implementing the change, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 65.63(e) and 65.67(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recovery device monitoring requirements. (1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between 1.0 and 4.0, either an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record, or a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device, each capable of providing a continuous record, shall be used. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 65.161. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec. 65.156.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between 1.0 and 4.0, either an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record, or a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device, each capable of providing a continuous record, shall be used. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 65.161. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec. 65.156.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between 1.0 and 4.0, an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record, or a condenser exit (product side) temperature monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record, shall be used. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 65.161. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec. 65.156.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between 1.0 and 4.0, an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record, or an integrating regeneration stream flow monitoring device having an accuracy of 10 percent or better capable of recording the total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow for each regeneration cycle, and a carbon-bed temperature monitoring device capable of recording the carbon-bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle, shall be used. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 65.161. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec. 65.156.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless previously approved by the Administrator under an applicable standard prior to the implementation date of this part, as specified in Sec. 65.1(f), if an owner or operator uses a recovery device other than those listed in this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit a description of planned monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping procedures as required under Sec. 65.162(e). The Administrator will approve or deny the proposed monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements as part of the review of the submission or permit application or by other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator shall establish a range for monitored parameters that indicates proper operation of the recovery device. In order to establish the range, the information required in Sec. 65.165(c) shall be submitted in the Initial Compliance Status Report or the operating permit application or amendment. The range may be based upon a prior performance test meeting the specifications in Sec. 65.157(b)(1) or upon existing ranges or limits established under a referencing subpart. Where the regeneration stream flow and carbon-bed temperature are monitored, the

range shall be in terms of the total regeneration stream flow per regeneration cycle, and the temperature of the carbon-bed determined within 15 minutes of the completion of the regeneration cooling cycle.</p>
