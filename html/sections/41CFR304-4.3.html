                                Sec.  304-4.3  Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You may accept payment for travel expenses to events other than  meetings from a non-Federal source pursuant to an agency gift statute or  similar statutory authority. However, this part 304 is the only  authority you may use to accept (or authorize your employee to accept on  your behalf) payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source to  attend a meeting. For example, you could not pay the travel expenses for  an employee to attend a meeting and then authorize the employee to use  the widely attended gathering exception in 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) to  accept free attendance at that same meeting. You would only be able to  accept payment for the employee's attendance at that meeting under this  part 304.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Employees may also be able to accept payment for travel  expenses from non-Federal sources in their individual capacities under  the authorities referenced in Sec.  304-3.19.</p>
