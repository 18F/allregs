                            <p class="depth0">This section sets forth the information which must be considered by the Director in authorizing Class VI wells. For converted Class I, Class II, or Class V experimental wells, certain maps, cross-sections, tabulations of wells within the area of review and other data may be included in the application by reference provided they are current, readily available to the Director, and sufficiently identified to be retrieved. In cases where EPA issues the permit, all the information in this section must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to the issuance of a permit for the construction of a new Class VI well or the conversion of an existing Class I, Class II, or Class V well to a Class VI well, the owner or operator shall submit, pursuant to Sec.  146.91(e), and the Director shall consider the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required in Sec.  144.31(e)(1) through (6) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A map showing the injection well for which a permit is sought and the applicable area of review consistent with Sec.  146.84. Within the area of review, the map must show the number or name, and location of all injection wells, producing wells, abandoned wells, plugged wells or dry holes, deep stratigraphic boreholes, State- or EPA-approved subsurface cleanup sites, surface bodies of water, springs, mines (surface and subsurface), quarries, water wells, other pertinent surface features including structures intended for human occupancy, State, Tribal, and Territory boundaries, and roads. The map should also show faults, if known or suspected. Only information of public record is required to be included on this map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information on the geologic structure and hydrogeologic properties of the proposed storage site and overlying formations, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maps and cross sections of the area of review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The location, orientation, and properties of known or suspected faults and fractures that may transect the confining zone(s) in the area of review and a determination that they would not interfere with containment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Data on the depth, areal extent, thickness, mineralogy, porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure of the injection and confining zone(s); including geology/facies changes based on field data which may include geologic cores, outcrop data, seismic surveys, well logs, and names and lithologic descriptions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Geomechanical information on fractures, stress, ductility, rock strength, and in situ fluid pressures within the confining zone(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information on the seismic history including the presence and depth of seismic sources and a determination that the seismicity would not interfere with containment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Geologic and topographic maps and cross sections illustrating regional geology, hydrogeology, and the geologic structure of the local area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A tabulation of all wells within the area of review which penetrate the injection or confining zone(s).
