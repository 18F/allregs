                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic rules. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State Medicaid agency has 1 year from the date of discovery of an overpayment to a provider to recover or seek to recover the overpayment before the Federal share must be refunded to CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State Medicaid agency must refund the Federal share of overpayments at the end of the 1-year period following discovery in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, whether or not the State has recovered the overpayment from the provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception. The agency is not required to refund the Federal share of an overpayment made to a provider when the State is unable to recover the overpayment amount because the provider has been determined bankrupt or out of business in accordance with Sec.  433.318.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to overpayments made to Medicaid providers that occur and are discovered in any quarter that begins on or after October 1, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date upon which an overpayment occurs is the date upon which a State, using its normal method of reimbursement for a particular class of provider (e.g., check, interfund transfer), makes the payment involving unallowable costs to a provider.
