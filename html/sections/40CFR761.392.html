Contaminate a minimum of eight surfaces for a complete validation study.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> As a quality control step, test at least one contaminated surface to determine the PCB concentration to verify that there are measurable surface levels of PCBs resulting from the contamination before soaking the surface in the decontamination solvent. The surface levels of PCBs on the contaminated surfaces must be =20 [micro]g/100 cm\2\.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To validate a procedure to decontaminate a specified surface concentrations of PCBs as measured by a standard wipe sample, contaminate a minimum of 10 surfaces. Contaminate all the surfaces identically following the procedures in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and measure the PCB surface concentrations of at least three of the surfaces using a standard wipe test to establish a surface concentration to be included in the standard operating procedure. The surface levels of PCBs on the contaminated surfaces must be =20 [micro]g/100 cm\2\.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
