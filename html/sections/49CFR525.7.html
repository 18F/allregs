With respect to automobiles which will not use these lubricants, explain the reasons for not so doing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each affected model year, a fuel economy value for each vehicle configuration specified in 40 CFR 600.506(a)(2), base level, and model type of the petitioner's passenger automobiles to be manufactured in that affected model year calculated in accordance with subpart C of 40 CFR part 600 and based on tests or analyses comparable to those prescribed or permitted under 40 CFR part 600 and a description of the test procedures or analytical methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For each affected model year, an average fuel economy figure for the petitioner's passenger automobiles to be manufactured in that affected model year calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 600.510(e) and based upon the fuel economy values provided under paragraph (f) of this section and upon the petitioner's production mix projected under paragraph (d) of this section for the affected model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Information demonstrating that the average fuel economy figure provided for each affected model year under paragraph (g) of this section is the maximum feasible average fuel economy achievable by the petitioner for that model year, including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each affected model year and each of the two model years immediately following the first affected model year, a description of the technological means selected by the petitioner for improving the average fuel economy of its automobiles to be manufactured in that model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A chronological description of the petitioner's past and planned efforts to implement the means described under paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on the fuel economy of the petitioner's automobiles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each affected model year, a discussion of the alternative and additional means considered but not selected by the petitioner that would have enabled its passenger automobiles to achieve a higher average fuel economy than is achievable with the means described under paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
