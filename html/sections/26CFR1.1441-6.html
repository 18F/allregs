                                Sec. 1.1441-6  Claim of reduced withholding under an income tax treaty.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, for  amounts for which it claims a reduced rate of withholding under an  income tax treaty on behalf of its interest holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dual treatment. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a  withholding agent may make a payment to a foreign entity that is  simultaneously claiming to be the beneficial owner of a portion of the  income (whether or not it is also claiming a reduced rate of tax on its  own behalf) and a reduced rate on behalf of persons in their capacity as  interest holders in the entity with respect to the same, or a different,  portion of the income. If the same portion of a payment may be reliably  associated with both the entity's claim and an interest holder's claim,  the withholding agent may choose to reject both claims and request new  documentation and information allocating the payment among the  beneficial owners of the payment or the withholding   agent may choose which claim to apply. If the entity and the interest  holder's claims are reliably associated with separate portions of the  payment, the withholding agent may, at its option, accept such dual  claims based on withholding certificates or other appropriate  documentation furnished by the entity and its interest holders with  respect to their respective shares of the payment even though this will  result in the withholding agent treating the entity differently with  respect to different portions of the same payment. Alternatively, the  withholding agent may choose to apply only the claim made by the entity,  provided the entity may be treated as a beneficial owner of the income.  If the withholding agent does not accept claims for a reduced rate of  withholding presented by any one or more of the interest holders, or by  the entity, any interest holder or the entity may subsequently claim a  refund or credit of any amount so withheld to the extent the interest  holder's or entity's share of such withholding exceeds the amount of tax  due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certified TIN. The IRS may issue guidance requiring a foreign  person claiming treaty benefits and for whom a TIN is required to  establish with the IRS, at the time the TIN is requested or after the  TIN is issued, that the person is a resident in a treaty country and  meets other conditions (such as limitation on benefits provisions) of  the treaty. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Claim of benefits under an income tax treaty by a U.S. person.  In certain cases, a U.S. person may claim the benefit of an income tax  treaty. For example, under certain treaties, a U.S. citizen residing in  the treaty country may claim a reduced rate of U.S. tax on certain  amounts representing a pension or an annuity from U.S. sources. Claims  of treaty benefits by a U.S. person may be made by furnishing a Form W-9  to the withholding agent or such other form as the IRS may prescribe in  published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, a stock or debt obligation is  actively traded if it is actively traded within the meaning of section  1092(d) and Sec. 1.1092(d)-1 when documentation is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certificate of residence. A certificate of residence referred to  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a certification issued by an  appropriate tax official of the treaty country of which the taxpayer  claims to be a resident that the taxpayer has filed its most recent  income tax return as a resident of that country (within the meaning of  the applicable tax treaty). The certificate of residence must have been  issued by such official within three years prior to its being presented  to the withholding agent, or such other period as the IRS may prescribe  in published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). See  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) for the period during which a withholding  agent may rely on a certificate of residence. The competent authorities  may agree to a different procedure for certifying residence, in which  case such procedure shall govern for payments made to a person claiming  to be a resident of the country with which such an agreement is in  effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Documentary evidence establishing residence in the treaty  country--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individuals. For an individual, the documentary evidence  referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is any documentation  that includes the individuals name, address, and photograph, is an  official document issued by an authorized governmental body (i.e., a  government or agency thereof, or a municipality), and has been issued no  more than three years prior to presentation to the withholding agent. A  document older than three years may be relied upon as proof of residence  only if it is accompanied by additional evidence of the person's  residence in the treaty country (e.g., a bank statement, utility bills,  or medical bills). Documentary evidence must be in the form of original  documents or certified copies thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Persons other than individuals. For a person other than an  individual, the documentary evidence referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of  this section is any documentation that includes the name of the entity  and the address of its principal office in the treaty country, and is an  official document issued by an authorized governmental body (e.g., a  government or agency thereof, or a municipality).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Statements regarding entitlement to treaty benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Statement regarding conditions under a limitation on benefits provision.  In addition to the documentary evidence described in (c)(4)(ii) of this  section, a taxpayer that is not an individual must provide a statement  that it meets one or more of the conditions set forth in the limitation  on benefits article (if any, or in a similar provision) contained in the  applicable tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statement regarding whether the taxpayer derives the income. A  taxpayer that is not an individual must also provide, in addition to the  documentary evidence and the statement described in paragraph (c)(5)(i)  of this section, a statement that any income for which it intends to  claim benefits under an applicable income tax treaty is income that will  properly be treated as derived by itself as a resident of the applicable  treaty jurisdiction within the meaning of section 894 and the  regulations thereunder. This requirement does not apply if the taxpayer  furnishes a certificate of residence that certifies that fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Joint owners. In the case of a payment to joint owners, each  owner must furnish a withholding certificate or, if applicable,  documentary evidence or a certificate of residence. The applicable rate  of withholding on a payment of income to joint owners shall be the  highest applicable rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Competent authority. The procedures described in this section  may be modified to the extent the U.S. competent authority may agree  with the competent authority of a country with which the United States  has an income tax treaty in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Failure to receive withholding certificate timely. See  applicable procedures described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the  withholding agent does not hold an appropriate withholding certificate  or other appropriate documentation at the time of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this section, for purposes of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a withholding agent may not rely on a  beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  of this section, that does not include the beneficial owner's taxpayer  identifying number (TIN).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule. For purposes of satisfying the TIN requirement of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a withholding agent may rely on a  beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in such paragraph,  without regard to the requirement that the withholding certificate  include the beneficial owner's TIN, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A withholding agent, who is also an acceptance agent, as defined  in Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv) of this chapter (the payor), has entered  into an acceptance agreement that permits the acceptance agent to  request an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) on an  expedited basis because of the circumstances of payment or unexpected  nature of payments required to be made by the payor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payor was required to make an unexpected payment to the  beneficial owner who is a foreign individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An ITIN for the beneficial owner cannot be received by the  payor from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because the IRS is not  issuing ITINs at the time of payment or any time prior to the time of  payment when the payor has knowledge of the unexpected payment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The unexpected payment to the beneficial owner could not be  reasonably delayed to permit the payor to obtain an ITIN for the  beneficial owner on an expedited basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The payor satisfies the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)(A)(4)</em> of this chapter, to the IRS  during the first business day after payment is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, a payor or beneficial owner will  not lack the requisite knowledge of the forthcoming payment solely  because the amount of the payment is not fixed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. G, a citizen and resident of Country Y, a country with  which the United States has an income tax treaty that exempts U.S.  source gambling winnings from U.S. tax, is visiting the United States  for the first time. During his visit, G visits Casino B, a casino that  has entered into a special acceptance agent agreement with the IRS that  permits Casino B to request an ITIN on an expedited basis. During that  visit, on a Sunday, G wins $5000 in slot machine play at Casino B and  requests immediate payment from Casino B. ITINs are not available from  the IRS on Sunday and would not again be available until Monday. G, who  does not have an individual taxpayer identification number, furnishes a  beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in Sec. 1.1441- 1(e)(2), to the Casino upon winning at the slot machine. The beneficial  owner withholding certificate represents that G is a resident of Country  Y (within the meaning of the U.S.-Y tax treaty) and meets all applicable  requirements for claiming benefits under the U.S.-Y tax treaty. The  beneficial owner withholding certificate does not, however, contain an  ITIN for G. On the following Monday, Casino B faxes a completed Form W- 7, including the required certification, for G, to the IRS for an  expedited ITIN. Pursuant to paragraph (b) and (g)(2) of this section,  absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, Casino B, may rely  on the documentation furnished by G at the time of payment and pay the  $5000 to G without withholding U.S. tax based on the treaty exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as Example 1, except G visits  Casino B on Monday. G requests payment Monday afternoon. In order to pay  the winnings to G without withholding the 30 percent tax, Casino B must  apply for and obtain an ITIN for G because an expedited ITIN is  available from the IRS at the time of the $5000 payment to G.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as Example 1, except G requests  payment fifteen minutes before the time when the IRS begins issuing  ITINs. Under these facts, it would be reasonable for Casino B to delay  payment to G. Therefore, Casino B must apply for and obtain an ITIN for  G if G wishes to claim an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the  U.S.-Y tax treaty at the time of payment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. P, a citizen and resident of Country Z, is a lawyer and a  well-known expert on real estate transactions. P is scheduled to attend  a three-day seminar on complex real estate transactions, as a  participant, at University U, a U.S. university, beginning on a Saturday  and ending on the following Monday, which is a holiday. University U has  entered into a special acceptance agent agreement with the IRS that  permits University U to request an ITIN on an expedited basis. Country Z  is a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty that  exempts certain income earned from the performance of independent  personal services from U.S. tax. It is P's first visit to the United  States. On Saturday, prior to the start of the seminar, Professor Q, one  of the lecturers at the seminar, cancels his lecture. That same day the  Dean of   University U offers P $5000, to replace Professor Q at the seminar,  payable at the conclusion of the seminar on Monday. P agrees. P gives  her lecture Sunday afternoon. ITINs are not available from the IRS on  that Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. After the seminar ends on Monday, P,  who does not have an ITIN, requests payment for her teaching. P  furnishes a beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2), to University U that represents that P is a  resident of Country Z (within the meaning of the U.S.-Z tax treaty) and  meets all applicable requirements for claiming benefits under the U.S.-Z  tax treaty. The beneficial owner withholding certificate does not,  however, contain an ITIN for P. On Tuesday, University U faxes a  completed Form W-7, including the required certification, for P, to the  IRS for an expedited ITIN. Pursuant to paragraph (b) and (g)(2) of this  section, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, University  U may rely on the documentation furnished by P and pay $5000 to P  without withholding U.S. tax based on the treaty exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Dividend equivalents. The rate of withholding on a dividend  equivalent may be reduced to the extent provided under an income tax  treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country. For  this purpose, a dividend equivalent as described in section 871(m) and  the regulations thereunder is treated as a dividend from sources within  the United States. To receive a reduced rate of withholding with respect  to a dividend equivalent, a foreign person must satisfy the other  requirements described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective/applicability dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. This section  applies to payments made after December 31, 2000, except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Paragraph (g) of this section applies to payments made after  December 31, 2001, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (h) of this section applies to payments made on or  after December 5, 2013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> with respect to one or  more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in effect  prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1,  1999) and, therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to  the requirements described in this section (new withholding  certificates). For purposes of this section, a new withholding  certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation requirement under the  regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and  35a, revised April 1, 1999). Further, a new withholding certificate  remains valid for the period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii),  regardless of when the certificate is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.

See also  Sec. 1.1441-4(b)(2) for rules regarding claims of a reduced rate of  withholding under an income tax treaty in the case of compensation from  personal services and Sec. 1.1441-4(c)(1) for rules regarding claims of  a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty in the case of  scholarship and fellowship income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b))</em>, a withholding agent may rely on the claims made on a  withholding certificate or on documentary evidence. A withholding agent  may also rely on the information contained in a withholding statement  provided under Secs. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) and 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iv) and  (e)(5)(iv) to determine whether the appropriate statements regarding  section 894 and limitation on benefits have been provided in connection  with documentary evidence. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may apply  the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)(B)</em> to notify the withholding  agent that the certificate cannot be relied upon to grant benefits under  an income tax treaty. See Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii) regarding reliance  on a withholding certificate by a withholding agent. The provisions of  Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) dealing with a 90-day   grace period shall apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>,  interest holders do not include any direct or indirect interest holders  that are themselves treated as fiscally transparent entities with  respect to that income by the interest holder's jurisdiction. See  Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(23) and (e)(3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> for the definition of flow-through  entity and flow-through withholding certificate. The entity may provide  a beneficial owner withholding certificate, or beneficial owner  documentation, with respect to any remaining portion of the income to  the extent the entity is receiving income and is not treated as fiscally  transparent by its own jurisdiction. Further, the entity may claim a  reduced rate of withholding with respect to the portion of a payment for  which it is not treated as fiscally transparent if it meets all the  requirements to make such a claim and, in the case of treaty benefits,  it provides the documentation required by paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. If dual claims, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this  section, are made, multiple withholding certificates may have to be  furnished. Multiple withholding certificates may also have to be  furnished if the entity receives income for which a reduction of  withholding is claimed under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code  (e.g., portfolio interest) and income for which a reduction of  withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and (iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each of the following examples  describes a payment of U.S. source royalties, which are not withholdable  payments under chapter 4. See Sec. 1.1473-1(a)(4)(iii) (describing  nonfinancial payments that are not treated as withholdable payments).  Thus, withholding under chapter 4 shall not apply with respect to the  U.S. source royalties in any of the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Entity E is a business organization formed  under the laws of country Y. Country Y has an income tax treaty with the  United States. The treaty contains a limitation on benefits provision. E  receives U.S. source royalties from withholding agent W and claims a  reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Y tax treaty on its own  behalf (rather than on behalf of its interest holders). E furnishes a  beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section that represents that E is a resident of country Y  (within the meaning of the U.S.-Y tax treaty), is the beneficial owner  of the income, derives the income under section 894 and the regulations  under section 894, and is not precluded from claiming benefits by the  treaty's limitation on benefits provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise,  W may rely on the representations made by E to apply a reduced rate of  withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> to which it attaches H's beneficial owner withholding  certificate and a withholding statement for the portion of the payment  that H claims as its distributive share of the royalty income. E also  furnishes to W a beneficial owner withholding certificate for itself for  the portion of the payment that H does not claim as its distributive  share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise,  W may rely on the documentation furnished by E to treat the royalty  payment to a single foreign entity (E) as derived by different residents  of tax treaty countries as a result of the claims presented under  different treaties. W may, at its option, grant dual treatment, that is,  a reduced rate of zero percent under the U.S.-Z treaty on the portion of  the royalty payment that H claims to derive as a resident of country Z  and a reduced rate of 5% under the U.S.-Y treaty for the balance.  However, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, W may, at its  option, treat E as the only relevant person deriving the royalty and  grant benefits under the U.S.-Y treaty only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. E is a business organization formed under the  laws of country X. Country X has an income tax treaty with the United  States. E has two interest holders, H1, organized in country Y, and H2,  organized in country Z. E receives from W, a U.S. withholding agent, a  payment of U.S. source royalties and interest, with respect to an  obligation issued before July 1, 2014, that is eligible for the  portfolio interest exception under sections 871(h) and 881(c), provided  W receives the appropriate beneficial owner statement required under  section 871(h)(5). E is classified as a corporation under U.S. tax law  principles. Country X, E's country of organization, treats E as an  entity that is not fiscally transparent with respect to items of income  under the regulations under section 894. Under the U.S.-X income tax  treaty, royalties are subject to a 5% rate of withholding. Country Y,  H1's country of organization, treats E as fiscally transparent with  respect to items of income under section 894 and H1 as not fiscally  transparent with respect to items of income. Under the country Y-U.S.  income tax treaty, royalties are exempt from U.S. tax. Country Z, H2's  country of organization, treats E as not fiscally transparent under  section 894 with respect to items of income. E provides W with a flow- through beneficial owner withholding certificate with which it  associates a beneficial owner withholding certificate from H1. H1's  withholding certificate states that H1 is a resident of country Y,  derives the royalty income under section 894, meets the applicable  limitations on benefits provisions of the U.S.-Y treaty, and is the  beneficial owner of the income. The withholding statement attached to  E's flow-through withholding certificate allocates one-half of the  royalty payment to H1. E also provides W with a beneficial owner  withholding certificate for the interest income and the remaining one- half of the royalty income. The withholding certificate states that E is  a resident of country X, derives the royalty income under section 894,  meets the limitation on benefits provisions of the U.S.-X treaty, and is  the beneficial owner of the income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know that the  claims are incorrect, W may treat one-half of the royalty derived by E  as subject to a 5% withholding rate and one-half of the royalty as  derived by H1 and subject to no withholding. Further, it may treat all  of the interest as being paid to E and as qualifying for the portfolio  interest exception. W can, at its option, treat the entire royalty as  paid to E and subject it to withholding at a 5% rate of withholding. In  that case, H1 would be entitled to claim a refund with respect to its  one-half of the royalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>  and (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to amounts  that are exempt from withholding based on a claim that the income is  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States. Notwithstanding the effective date of this section, the  provisions of this paragraph apply for payments made on or after March  6, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective/applicability dates.
