                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Compliance with Sec. 25.1041 must be shown by tests, under critical ground, water, and flight operating conditions. For these tests, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No corrected temperatures determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may exceed established limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For reciprocating engines, the fuel used during the cooling tests must be the minimum grade approved for the engines, and the mixture settings must be those normally used in the flight stages for which the cooling tests are conducted. The test procedures must be as prescribed in Sec. 25.1045.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature. A maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at least 100 degrees F must be established. The assumed temperature lapse rate is 3.6 degrees F per thousand feet of altitude above sea level until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F is reached, above which altitude the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees F. However,

for winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less than 100 degrees F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correction factor (except cylinder barrels). Unless a more rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures. Unless a more rational correction applies, cylinder barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling test.
