                            <p class="depth0">BOEM will issue leases on a competitive basis, as provided under Sec. Sec.  585.210 through 585.225. However, if we determine after public notice of a proposed lease that there is no competitive interest, we will issue leases noncompetitively, as provided under Sec. Sec.  585.230 and 585.232. We will issue leases on forms approved by BOEM and will include terms, conditions, and stipulations identified and developed through the process set forth in Sec. Sec.  585.211 and 585.231.</p>
