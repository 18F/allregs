Further proof of authority to act  in a representative capacity may be required. A notice of appearance  entered in application or petition proceedings must be signed by the  applicant or petitioner to authorize representation in order for the  appearance to be recognized by the Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of 8 CFR chapter I, a  party to a proceeding or his attorney or representative shall be  permitted to examine the record of proceeding in a Service office.
