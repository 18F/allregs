The  inspector will determine if the tests and inspections required by Sec.   97.15-60 of this subchapter have been conducted. At each inspection for  certification and periodic inspection, the inspector will check fire- extinguishing equipment with the following tests and inspections:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.  In addition, the hand portable fire extinguishers and semi-portable fire  extinguishing systems shall be examined for excessive corrosion and  general condition.</p><p class="depth3">Table 91.25-20(a)(1) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Type unit                               Test ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Soda acid................................
