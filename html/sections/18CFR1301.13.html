                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual may, in accordance with this section (1) request a  TVA determination whether a record retrieved by the individual's name or  other personal identifier is maintained in a TVA system, and (2) request  access to such a record. A request for determination may be combined  with a request for access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests under this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing and signed by the individual seeking the  determination or access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include the individual's mailing address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name the TVA system as listed in the TVA system notice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include any additional identifying information specified in the  paragraph headed ``Notification procedure'' in the applicable TVA system  notice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specify whether the request is for determination only or for  both determination and access; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include such proof of identity as may be required by Sec.  1301.14 and the applicable system notice.  Requests may be presented in person or by mail. In-person requests shall  be presented during normal TVA business hours, as set out in Sec.  1301.14(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for determination only shall be presented to the  official designated in the paragraph headed ``Notification procedure''  in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Requests for both  determination and access shall be presented to the official designated  in the paragraph headed ``Access procedure'' in the TVA system notice  for the TVA system concerned. Certain TVA system notices designate  officials at field locations of TVA systems. With respect to such TVA  systems, an individual who believes his record is located at the field  location may present a request to the designated official at the field  location. If the record is not available at that field location, the  request will be forwarded to the appropriate TVA office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a request is for determination only, the determination will  normally be made within 10 days after receipt of the request. If the  determination cannot be made within 10 days after receipt of a request,  the designated official will acknowledge the request in writing and  state when the determination will be made. Upon making a determination,  the designated official will notify the individual making the request  whether the record exists. The notice will include any additional  information necessary to enable the individual to request access to the  record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A request which includes a request for access will be  acknowledged within 10 days after receipt. If access can be granted as  requested, the acknowledgment will provide a time and place for  disclosure of the requested record. Disclosure will normally be made  within 30 days of the date of the acknowledgement, but the designated  official may extend the 30-day period for reasons found by him to be  good cause. In case of an extension, TVA will notify the individual, in  writing, that disclosure will be delayed, the reasons for delay, and the  anticipated date on which the individual may expect the record to be  disclosed. TVA will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests for  disclosure at specified times and dates, as set forth in a request for  access, so far as compatible with the conduct of TVA business.</p>
