An arrangement by which a licensed practitioner  requests in writing that a specified number of drug samples be delivered  over a period of not more than 6 months, with the actual delivery dates  for parts of the order to be set by subsequent oral communication or  electronic transmission, is not considered to be a standing request.</p>
