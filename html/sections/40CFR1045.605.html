                                Sec.  1045.605  What provisions apply to engines already certified
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. If you are an engine manufacturer, this  section allows you to introduce new propulsion marine engines into U.S.  commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to  spark-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or part 1048 for the  appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this  section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048  for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this  part 1045 for its model year, without a separate application for  certification under the requirements of this part 1045.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vessel-manufacturer provisions. If you are not an engine  manufacturer, you may produce vessels using motor vehicle engines or  nonroad spark-ignition engines under this section as long   as you meet all the requirements and conditions specified in paragraph  (d) of this section. If you modify the engine in any of the ways  described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we will consider you a  manufacturer of a new propulsion marine engine. Such engine  modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability. Engines for which you meet the requirements of this  section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this  part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under  this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts  85 and 86, or part 1048. This applies to engine manufacturers, vessel  manufacturers who use these engines, and all other persons as if these  engines were used in applications other than for installation as  propulsion marine engines. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1)  apply to these new engines and vessels; however, we consider the  certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to also  be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1045 for its model  year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to  the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall  them under 40 CFR part 86 or 1068.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific requirements. If you are an engine or vessel  manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements  regarding your new propulsion marine engine, the engine is eligible for  an exemption under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your engine must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity  issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must not make any changes to the certified engine that could  reasonably be expected to increase its exhaust emissions for any  pollutant, or its evaporative emissions. For example, if you make any of  the following changes to one of these engines, you do not qualify for  this exemption:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Change any fuel-system or evaporative-system parameters from the  certified configuration (this does not apply to refueling controls).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Change, remove, or fail to properly install any other  component, element of design, or calibration specified in the engine  manufacturer's application for certification. This includes  aftertreatment devices and all related components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Modify or design the marine engine cooling system so that  temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original engine  manufacturer's specified ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must show that fewer than 10 percent of the engine family's  total sales in the United States are used in marine applications. This  includes engines used in any application without regard to which company  manufactures the vessel or equipment. Show this as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this  showing on your sales information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of  the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must ensure that the engine has the label we require under  40 CFR part 86 or 1048.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must add a permanent supplemental label to the engine in a  position where it will remain clearly visible after installation in the  vessel. In the supplemental label, do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include the heading: ``MARINE ENGINE EMISSION CONTROL  INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may instead  include the full corporate name and trademark of another company you  choose to designate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State: ``THIS ENGINE WAS ADAPTED FOR MARINE USE WITHOUT  AFFECTING ITS EMISSION CONTROLS.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the modified engine is certified as a motor vehicle engine,  also state: ``THE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE USE OF FUEL  MEETING SPECIFICATIONS THAT APPLY FOR MOTOR VEHICLE APPLICATIONS.  OPERATING THE ENGINE ON OTHER FUELS MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> State the date you finished modifying the engine (month and  year), if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The original and supplemental labels must be readily visible  after the engine is installed in the vessel or, if   the vessel obscures the engine's emission control information label, the  vessel manufacturer must attach duplicate labels, as described in 40 CFR  1068.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter by the  end of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you) with all the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone  number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List the engine or vessel models you expect to produce under  this exemption in the coming year and describe your basis for meeting  the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State: ``We produce each listed [engine or vessel] model  without making any changes that could increase its certified emission  levels, as described in 40 CFR 1045.605.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to comply. If your engines do not meet the criteria  listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the  standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 1045 and the  certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 will not be deemed to  also be a certificate issued under this part 1045. Introducing these  engines into U.S. commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of  conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data submission. We may require you to send us emission test  data on one of the duty cycles specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Participation in averaging, banking and trading. Engines adapted  for marine use under this section may not generate or use emission  credits under this part 1045. These engines may generate credits under  the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86. These engines must use emission  credits under 40 CFR part 86 if they are certified to an FEL above a  standard that applies under 40 CFR part 86.</p>
