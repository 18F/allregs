                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reactor cattle and bison. Cattle or bison that have been  classified as reactor cattle or bison may be moved interstate only if  they are moved directly to slaughter at a recognized slaughtering  establishment and only in accordance with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reactor cattle and bison must be individually identified by  attaching to the left ear an approved metal eartag bearing a serial  number and the inscription ``U.S. Reactor,'' or a similar State reactor  tag, and must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Branded with the letter ``T,'' at least 5 by 5 centimeters (2 by  2 inches) in size, high on the left hip near the tailhead; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Permanently identified with the letters ``TB'' tattooed legibly  in the left ear and sprayed with yellow paint on the left ear and either  accompanied directly to slaughter by an APHIS or State representative or  moved directly to slaughter in vehicles closed with official seals. Such  official seals must be applied and removed by an APHIS representative,  State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an individual  authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reactor cattle or bison must be accompanied by a permit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reactor cattle or bison may not be moved interstate in a  means of conveyance containing any animals susceptible to tuberculosis  unless all of the animals are being moved directly to slaughter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any person who moves reactor cattle or bison interstate under  this paragraph must plainly write or stamp upon the face of the VS Form  1-27 the words ``Tuberculin Reactor'' and the following statement:  ``This conveyance must be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 9  CFR 77.17(a)(5).''; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each means of conveyance in which reactor cattle or bison have  been transported interstate under this paragraph must be cleaned and  disinfected by the carrier, in accordance with the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 71.6, 71.7, and 71.10 of this subchapter, under the  supervision of an APHIS representative or State representative or an  accredited veterinarian or other person designated by the Administrator.  If, at the point where the cattle or bison are unloaded, such  supervision or proper cleaning and disinfecting facilities are not  available, and permission is obtained from an APHIS representative or  State representative, the empty means of conveyance may be moved to a  location where such supervision and facilities are available for  cleaning and disinfecting. Permission will be granted if such movement  does not present a risk of disseminating tuberculosis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exposed cattle and bison. Except for the movement of exposed  cattle to a quarantined feedlot in accordance with Sec. 50.16 of this  chapter, exposed cattle or bison may be moved interstate only if they  are moved directly to slaughter to a recognized slaughtering  establishment and only in accordance with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exposed cattle and bison must be individually identified by  attaching to either ear an approved metal eartag bearing a serial number  and must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Branded with the letter ``S,'' at least 5 by 5 centimeters (2 by  2 inches) in size, high on the left hip near the tailhead; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Accompanied directly to slaughter by an APHIS or State  representative; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Moved directly to slaughter in vehicles closed with official  seals. Such official seals must be applied and removed by an APHIS  representative, State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an  individual authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (a)(3), and (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suspect cattle and bison. Suspect cattle or bison from herds in  which no reactor cattle or bison have been disclosed on an official  tuberculin test, as well as negative cattle or bison from such herds,  may be moved interstate only if they are moved directly to slaughter to  a recognized slaughtering establishment in accordance with 9 CFR part  86.
