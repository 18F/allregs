                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand  station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting  channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes  during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of  the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the  transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or  signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not  authorized to the station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized  for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only  for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic  alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or  part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission  standards, either color or monochrome, of Sec. 73.682(a) of the FCC  Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same  image emission</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each  indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or  by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is  self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and  after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any  other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned  to another country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special  significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a  special event call sign as shown for that station for that period of  time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by  the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the  station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour  during such transmissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the operator license class held by the control operator  exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the  call sign assigned to the control operator's station must be included  after the call sign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the control operator is a person who is exercising the  rights and privileges authorized by Sec. 97.9(b) of this part, an  indicator must be included after the call sign as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a control operator who has requested a license modification  from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a control operator who has requested a license modification  from Novice or Technician to General Class: AG;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a control operator who has requested a license modification  from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class to Amateur Extra  Class: AE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When the station is transmitting under the authority of Sec.  97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate letter- numeral designating the station location must be included before the  call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the  license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of  Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At  least once during each intercommunication, the identification  announcement must include the geographical location as   nearly as possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.
