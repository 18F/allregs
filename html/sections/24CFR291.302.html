                            <p class="depth0">This subpart sets forth HUD's policy and procedures for the sale of  HUD-held single family mortgage loans. In general, HUD will sell both  performing and nonperforming HUD-held single family mortgage loans. HUD  will sell all mortgage loans without recourse and without FHA insurance.  HUD will package pools of single family mortgage loans for sale to the  general public on a competitive basis; however, HUD may sell mortgage  loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on a negotiated basis.  Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to prevent HUD from packaging  single family mortgage loans with other types of HUD assets for sale.  The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying pool of  mortgage loans for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered pool of  mortgage loans from sale. However, when HUD offers a qualifying mortgage  loan for sale, the procedures set out in this subpart and in the bid  package will govern the sale of HUD-held single family mortgage loans.</p>
