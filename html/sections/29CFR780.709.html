                            <p class="depth0">Typically, the establishments commonly recognized as country  elevators are small. Most of the establishments intended to come within  the exemption have only one or two employees (107 Cong. Rec. (daily ed.)  p. 5883), although some country elevators have a larger number. (See  Holt v. Barnesville Elevator Co., 145 F. 2d 250.) Establishments with  more than five employees are not within the exemption. (See Sec.  780.712.) The storage capacity of a country elevator may be as small as  6,000 bushels (see Tobin v. Flour Mills, 185 F. 2d 596) and will  generally range from 15,000 to 50,000 bushels. As indicated in Sec.  780.708, country elevators are equipped to receive grain in wagons or  trucks from farmers and to load it in railroad boxcars. The facilities  typically include scales for weighing the farm vehicles loaded with  grain, grain bins, cleaning and mixing machinery, driers for prestorage  drying of grain and endless conveyor belts or chain scoops to carry  grain from the ground to the top of the elevator. The facilities for  receiving grain in truckloads or wagonloads from farmers and the limited  storage capacity, together with location of the elevator in or near the  grain-producing area, serve to distinguish country elevators from  terminal or subterminal elevators, to which the exemption is not  applicable. The latter are located at terminal or interior market  points, receive grain in carload lots, and receive the bulk of their  grain from country elevators. Although some may receive grain from farms  in the immediate areas, they are not typically equipped to receive grain  except by rail. (See Tobin v. Flour Mills, supra; Mitchell v. Sampson  Const. Co. (D. Kan.) 14 WH Cases 269.) It is the facilities of a country  elevator for the elevation of bulk grain and the discharge of such grain  into rail cars that make it an ``elevator'' and distinguish it from   warehouses that perform similar functions in the flat warehousing,  storage, and marketing for farmers of grain in sacks. Such warehouses  are not ``elevators'' and therefore do not come within the section  13(b)(14) exemption.</p>
