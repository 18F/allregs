                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who imports, or who knowingly causes to be imported, processed tobacco must make and keep records of operations and transactions. A person purchasing processed tobacco from the importer in a domestic transaction and who does not knowingly cause the processed tobacco to be imported is not required to make and keep records unless the terms and conditions of the importation are controlled by the person placing the order with the importer (for example, the importer is not an independent contractor but the agent of the person placing the order). Records maintained must reflect the date and quantity of processed tobacco:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Imported;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Received otherwise than through importation, together with the name and address of the person from whom it was received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Returned to customs custody or exported;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transferred or sold to a person who holds a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except in the case of returns to customs custody or exportations, transferred or sold to a person who does not hold a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Lost or destroyed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Transferred between buildings that are covered under the same permit but that are not located in the same city, town, village, or State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The records of any importer who transfers or sells processed tobacco to a person who does not hold a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor must include dated, commercial records that show the following information about each removal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The full name and business address (including city and State) of the purchaser (if there is a purchaser) or the full name and business address of the recipient (if there is no purchaser), or personal address if the purchaser or recipient is not a business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The full name, business address (including city and State), and driver's license number of the person picking up the processed tobacco for delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The license number of the vehicle in which the processed tobacco is picked up for delivery to purchaser or transferee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The street address of the destination of the processed tobacco;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The quantity of processed tobacco in the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The entries in the records required under this section must be made for each day by the close of the business day following the day on which the transfer or sale occurs. There is no particular format prescribed for the records required under this section (and commercial records may be used), although the required information must be readily ascertainable from the records kept. In the case of a removal under paragraph (a)(5) of this section that involves shipment by a common carrier, the appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure pursuant to Sec. 41.26 of this part through which the importer may keep records regarding the common carrier and its means of tracking (including pick up and delivery) of the shipment in lieu of the information required by paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. No records are required to be kept under this part regarding processed tobacco within customs custody, although this will not preclude TTB review of records related to such processed tobacco as may be appropriate for purposes of the enforcement of the provisions of this part.
