                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Commission may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debt owed to the Commission by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall include a written certification that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor owes the Commission a debt, including the amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission has complied with the requirements of 31 CFR 901.3, including any required hearing or review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once the Commission decides to request administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it shall make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor shall be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Commission collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.
