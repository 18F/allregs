                                Sec. 780.719  Employees not employed ``by'' the elevator establishment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Since the exemption depends on employment ``by'' an establishment  qualified for exemption rather than simply the work of the employee,  employees who are not employed by the country elevator are not exempt.  This is so even though they work in the establishment and engage in  duties which are part of the services which are commonly recognized as  those of a country elevator. Since they are not employed by the  elevator, employees of independent contractors, farmers and others who  work in or for the elevator are not exempt under section 13(b)(14)  simply because they work in or for the elevator (see Walling v. Friend,  156 F. 2d 429; Mitchell v. Kroger, 248 F. 2d 935; Durkin v. Joyce  Agency, 110 F. Supp. 918, affirmed sub. nom. Mitchell v. Joyce Agency,  348 U.S. 945). Thus an employee of an independent contractor who works  inside the elevator in drying grain for the elevator is not exempt under  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Employment ``Within the Area of Production''    Sec. 780.720  ``Area of production'' requirement of exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements for exemption previously  discussed, section 13(b)(14) requires that the employee employed by an  establishment commonly recognized as a country elevator be ``employed  within the area of production (as defined by the Secretary).''  Regulations defining employment within the ``area of production'' for  purposes of section 13(b)(14) are contained in part 536 of this chapter.  All the requirements of the applicable regulations must be met in order  for the exemption to apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(14)</em> if the country elevator establishment by which he is employed  is located in the ``open country or a rural community,'' as defined in  the regulations, and receives 95 percent or more of the agricultural  commodities handled through its elevator services from normal rural  sources of supply within specified distances from the country elevator.  A definition of ``area of production'' in terms of such criteria has  been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Budd, 350 U.S. 473.  Reference should be made to part 536 of this chapter for the precise  requirements of the definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> However, it is appropriate to point out here that nothing in the  definition places limits on the distance from which commodities come to  the elevator for purposes other than the storage of marketing of farm  products. The commodities, 95 percent of which are required by  definition to come from specified distances, are those agriculural  commodities received by the elevator with respect to which it performs  the primary concentration,   storage, and marketing functions of a country elevator as previously  explained (see Sec. 780.708). This is consistent with the emphasis  given, in the legislative history, to the country elevator's function of  marketing farm products, mostly grain, for farmers (see 107 Cong. Rec.  (daily ed.) p. 5883). Commodities brought or shipped to a country  elevator establishment not for storage or for market but in connection  with its secondary, incidental, or side-line functions of selling  products and services used in the operation of a farm (see Sec.  780.610) are not required to be counted in determining whether 95  percent of the agricultural commodities handled come from rural sources  of supply within the specified distances.</p><p class="depth2">Workweek Application of Exemption</p>
