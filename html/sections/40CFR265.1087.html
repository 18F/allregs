                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply to the control of air pollutant emissions from containers for which Sec. 265.1083(b) of this subpart references the use of this section for such air emission control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. (1) The owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from each container subject to this section in accordance with the following requirements, as applicable to the container, except when the special provisions for waste stabilization processes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply to the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.1 m\3\ and less than or equal to 0.46 m\3\, the owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from the container in accordance with the Container Level 1 standards specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m\3\ that is not in light material service, the owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from the container in accordance with the Container Level 1 standards specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m\3\ that is in light material service, the owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from the container in accordance with the Container Level 2 standards specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a container having a design capacity greater than 0.1 m\3\ is used for treatment of a hazardous waste by a waste stabilization process, the owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from the container in accordance with the Container Level 3 standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section at those times during the waste stabilization process when the hazardous waste in the container is exposed to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Container Level 1 standards. (1) A container using Container Level 1 controls is one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging

hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A container equipped with a cover and closure devices that form a continuous barrier over the container openings such that when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position there are no visible holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container. The cover may be a separate cover installed on the container (e.g., a lid on a drum or a suitably secured tarp on a roll-off box) or may be an integral part of the container structural design (e.g., a ``portable tank'' or bulk cargo container equipped with a screw-type cap).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An open-top container in which an organic-vapor suppressing barrier is placed on or over the hazardous waste in the container such that no hazardous waste is exposed to the atmosphere. One example of such a barrier is application of a suitable organic-vapor suppressing foam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A container used to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(1)(iii) of this section shall be equipped with covers and closure devices, as applicable to the container, that are composed of suitable materials to minimize exposure of the hazardous waste to the atmosphere and to maintain the equipment integrity for as long as it is in service. Factors to be considered in selecting the materials of construction and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: Organic vapor permeability, the effects of contact with the hazardous waste or its vapor managed in the container; the effects of outdoor exposure of the closure device or cover material to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices for which the container is intended to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever a hazardous waste is in a container using Container Level 1 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices for the container, as applicable to the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding hazardous waste or other material to the container as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either the container being filled to the intended final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person performing the loading operation leaving the immediate vicinity of the container; or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing hazardous waste from the container as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in 40 CFR 261.7(b) may be open to the atmosphere at any time (i.e., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in 40 CFR 261.7(b), the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container within 15 minutes or the person performing the unloading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access inside the container is needed to perform routine

activities other than transfer of hazardous waste. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable to the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Opening of a spring-loaded, pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the container internal pressure in accordance with the design specifications of the container. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the internal pressure of the container is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on container manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the internal pressure of the container exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec. 265.1081 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require doing so to avoid an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of containers using Container Level 1 controls shall inspect the containers and their covers and closure devices as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case when a hazardous waste already is in the container at the time the owner or operator first accepts possession of the container at the facility and the container is not emptied within 24 hours after the container is accepted at the facility (i.e., does not meet the conditions for an empty container as specified in 40 CFR 261.7(b)), the owner or operator shall visually inspect the container and its cover and closure devices to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. The container visual inspection shall be conducted on or before the date that the container is accepted at the facility (i.e., the date the container becomes subject to the subpart CC container standards). For purposes of this requirement, the date of acceptance is the date of signature that the facility owner or operator enters on Item 20 of the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest in the appendix to 40 CFR part 262 (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A), as required under subpart E of this part, at 40 CFR 265.71. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case when a container used for managing hazardous waste remains at the facility for a period of 1 year or more, the owner or operator shall visually inspect the container and its cover and closure devices initially and thereafter, at least once every 12 months, to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When a defect is detected for the container, cover, or closure devices, the owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 24 hours after detection, and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 5 calendar days after detection. If repair of a defect cannot be completed within 5 calendar days, then the hazardous waste shall be removed from the container and the container shall not be used to manage

hazardous waste until the defect is repaired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain at the facility a copy of the procedure used to determine that containers with capacity of 0.46 m\3\ or greater, which do not meet applicable DOT regulations as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, are not managing hazardous waste in light material service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Container Level 2 standards. (1) A container using Container Level 2 controls is one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A container that operates with no detectable organic emissions as defined in Sec. 265.1081 of this subpart and determined in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A container that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be vapor-tight by using 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 27 in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of hazardous waste in or out of a container using Container Level 2 controls shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize exposure of the hazardous waste to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, considering the physical properties of the hazardous waste and good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive or other hazardous materials. Examples of container loading procedures that the EPA considers to meet the requirements of this paragraph include using any one of the following: A submerged-fill pipe or other submerged-fill method to load liquids into the container; a vapor-balancing system or a vapor-recovery system to collect and control the vapors displaced from the container during filling operations; or a fitted opening in the top of a container through which the hazardous waste is filled and subsequently purging the transfer line before removing it from the container opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever a hazardous waste is in a container using Container Level 2 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices for the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding hazardous waste or other material to the container as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either the container being filled to the intended final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person performing the loading operation leaving the immediate vicinity of the container; or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing hazardous waste from the container as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in 40 CFR 261.7(b) may be open to the atmosphere at any time (i.e., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in 40 CFR 261.7(b), the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container
