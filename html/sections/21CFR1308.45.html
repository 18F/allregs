This order shall specify the date  on which it shall take effect, which shall not be less than 30 days from  the date of publication in the Federal Register unless the Administrator  finds that conditions of public health or safety necessitate an earlier  effective date, in which event the Administrator shall specify in the  order his findings as to such conditions.
