                                Sec. 400.43  Uniform treatment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to Section 14 of the FTZ Act (19 U.S.C. 81n), a grantee  shall afford to all who may apply to make use of or participate in the  zone uniform treatment under like conditions. Treatment of zone  participants within a zone (including application of rates and charges)  shall not vary depending on whether a zone participant has procured any  zone-related product or service or engaged a particular supplier to  provide any such product or service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreements to be made in writing. Any agreement or contract  related to one or more grantee function(s) and involving a zone  participant (e.g., agreements with property owners and agreements with  zone operators) must be in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of proposals. A grantee (or person undertaking a  zone-related function(s) on behalf of a grantee, where applicable) shall  apply uniform treatment in the evaluation of proposals from zone  participants. Uniform treatment does not require acceptance of all  proposals by zone participants, but the bases for a grantee's decision  on a particular proposal must be consistent with the uniform treatment  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Justification for differing treatment. Given the requirement for  uniform treatment under like conditions, for any instance of different  treatment of different zone participants, a grantee (or person  undertaking a zone-related function(s) on behalf of a grantee, where  applicable) must be able to provide upon request by the Executive  Secretary a documented justification for any difference in treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> of  this section (except in specific circumstances where the Board has  authorized a waiver pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Key functions are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Taking action on behalf of a grantee, or making recommendations  to a grantee, regarding the disposition of proposals or requests by zone  participants pertaining to FTZ authority or activity (including  activation by CBP);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Approving, or being a party to, a zone participant's agreement  with the grantee (or person acting on behalf of the grantee) pertaining  to FTZ authority or activity (including activation by CBP); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overseeing zone participants' operations on behalf of a  grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Key categories of persons are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person that currently engages in, or which has during the  preceding twelve months engaged in, offering/providing a zone-related  product/service to or representing a zone participant in the grantee's  zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person that stands to gain from a person's offer/provision  of a zone-related product/service to or representation of a zone  participant in the zone; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any person related, as defined in paragraph (e) of this  section, to the person identified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definition of related persons. For purposes of this section,  persons that are related include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members of a family or members of a household. The term members  of a family means spouses, parents, grandparents, children,  grandchildren, siblings (including half-siblings and step-siblings),  aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and first cousins, as well as the  parents, children, and siblings of a spouse, and the spouse of a  sibling, child or parent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organizations that are wholly or majority-owned by members of  the same family or members of the same household;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An officer or director of an organization and that organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Partners;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employers and their employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An organization and any person directly or indirectly owning,  controlling, or holding with power to vote, 20 percent or more of the  outstanding voting stock or shares of that organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any person that controls any other person and that other person  (the term control means the power, direct or indirect, whether or not  exercised, through any means, to determine, direct, or decide important  matters affecting an entity); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any two or more persons who directly control, are controlled by,  or are under common control with, any person (see definition of control  in paragraph (e)(7) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waivers. The grantee or other person subject to paragraph (d) of  this section may submit an application requesting that the Board issue a  waiver exempting from the prohibition of that paragraph a person's  undertaking a specific key function(s) listed in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section. Using the format developed by the Executive Secretary, an  application for a waiver shall explain in detail how the person falls  within a key category(ies) set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,  and the specific key function(s) listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section that would be undertaken by the person. After receipt of an  application requesting a waiver, the Executive Secretary may solicit  additional information or clarification, as necessary, including from  the person submitting the application and from the grantee. Based on the  information presented in the application, the Executive Secretary shall  make a recommendation to the Board. A waiver shall be authorized only by  an affirmative vote by the Board. If the Board votes not to authorize a  waiver or to discontinue a waiver, the applicant shall be notified in  writing and allowed 30 days to present evidence in response. In deciding  whether to grant a waiver, the Board shall determine whether there is an  unacceptable risk that the waiver would result in non-uniform treatment  being afforded by the person undertaking a key function(s) listed in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In its assessment, the Board shall  consider the specific circumstances presented, including the nature and  extent of the person's involvement in undertaking a key function(s)  listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In general, the more  significant the requester's involvement or interest in the undertaking  of a key function(s) listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or  activity(ies) identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the  greater the risk will be that non-uniform treatment will be afforded  and, thus, the less likely it will be that a waiver will be granted. The  Board may attach to individual waivers such conditions or limitations  (including, for example, the length of time a waiver is to be effective)  as it deems necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requests for determinations. A grantee or other party may  request a determination by the Executive Secretary regarding the  consistency of an actual or potential arrangement with the requirements  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Identification of person undertaking function(s) on behalf of  grantee. The Board, the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for  Enforcement and Compliance, or the Executive Secretary, may require a  zone grantee to identify any person undertaking a zone-related  function(s) on behalf of the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Delayed compliance date. If, as of April 30, 2012, existing  business arrangements do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs  (a) and (d) of   this section, such existing arrangements shall be terminated or brought  into compliance no later than February 28, 2014.</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 77 FR 12139, Feb. 28, 2012, Sec. 400.43 was  added. Paragraph (f) contains information collection and recordkeeping  requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given  by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
