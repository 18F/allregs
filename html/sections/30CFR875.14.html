You may address any eligible

coal problems with the certified in lieu funds that you have already received or will receive from Sec. 872.32 of this chapter. You may also use the prior balance replacement funds received from Sec. 872.29 of this chapter to address coal problems subsequent to certification. Any coal reclamation projects that you do must conform to sections 401 through 410 of SMCRA and part 874 of this chapter.
