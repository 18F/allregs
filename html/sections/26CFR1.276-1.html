                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no deduction shall be allowed for income tax purposes in respect of any amount paid or incurred after March 15, 1966, in a taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1965, for any expenditure to which paragraph (b)(1), (c), (d), or (e) of this section is applicable. Section 276 is a disallowance provision exclusively and does not make deductible any expenses which are not otherwise allowed under the Code. For certain other rules in respect of deductions for expenditures for political purposes, see Sec. Sec. 1.162-15(b), 1.162-20, and 1.271-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advertising in convention program--(1) General rule. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in a convention program of a political party. For purposes of this subparagraph it is immaterial who publishes the convention program or to whose use the proceeds of the program inure (or are intended to inure). A convention program is any written publication (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) which is distributed or displayed in connection with or at a political convention, conclave, or meeting. Under certain conditions payments to a committee organized for the purpose of bringing a political convention to an area are deductible under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.162-15. This rule is not affected by the provisions of this section. For example, such payments may be deductible notwithstanding the fact that the committee purchases from a political party the right to publish a pamphlet in connection with a convention and that the deduction of costs of advertising in the pamphlet is prohibited under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in a convention program of a political party.

For purposes of this subparagraph it is immaterial who publishes the convention program or to whose use the proceeds of the program inure (or are intended to inure).

M Corporation publishes the convention program of the Y political party for a convention not described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The corporation makes no payment of any kind to or on behalf of the party or any of its candidates and no part of the proceeds of the publication and sale of the program inures directly or indirectly to the benefit of any political party or candidate. P Corporation purchases an advertisement in the program. P Corporation may not deduct the cost of such advertisement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for advertising in programs of certain national political conventions. (i) Subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a deduction may be allowed for any amount paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for advertising in a convention program of a political party distributed in connection with a convention held for the purpose of nominating candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, if the proceeds from the program are actually used solely to defray the costs of conducting the convention (or are set aside for such use at the next convention of the party held for such purpose) and if the amount paid or incurred for the advertising is reasonable. If such amount is not reasonable or if any part of the proceeds is used for a purpose other than that of defraying such convention costs, no part of the amount is deductible. Whether or not an amount is reasonable shall be determined in light of the business the taxpayer may expect to receive either directly as a result of the advertising or as a result of the convention being held in an area in which the taxpayer has a principal place of business. For these purposes, an amount paid or incurred for advertising will not be considered as reasonable if it is greater than the amount which would be paid for comparable advertising in a comparable convention program of a nonpolitical organization. Institutional advertising (e.g., advertising of a type not designed to sell specific goods or services to persons attending the convention) is not advertising which may be expected to result

directly in business for the taxpayer sufficient to make the expenditures reasonable. Accordingly, an amount spent for institutional advertising in a convention program may be deductible only if the taxpayer has a principal place of business in the area where the convention is held. An official statement made by a political party after a convention as to the use made of the proceeds from its convention program shall constitute prima facie evidence of such use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a deduction may be allowed for any amount paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for advertising in a convention program of a political party distributed in connection with a convention held for the purpose of nominating candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, if the proceeds from the program are actually used solely to defray the costs of conducting the convention (or are set aside for such use at the next convention of the party held for such purpose) and if the amount paid or incurred for the advertising is reasonable.

Therefore, in order for any such amount to be deductible, it must first satisfy the requirements of section 162, and, in addition, it must also satisfy the more restrictive requirements of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advertising in publication other than convention program. No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in any publication other than a convention program if any part of the proceeds of such publication directly or indirectly inures (or is intended to inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, a publication includes a book, magazine, pamphlet, brochure, flier, almanac, newspaper, newsletter, handbill, billboard, menu, sign, scorecard, program, announcement, radio or television program or announcement, or any similar means of communication. For the definition of inurement of proceeds to a political party or a political candidate, see paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Admission to dinner or program. No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for admission to any dinner or program, if any part of the proceeds of such event directly or indirectly inures (or is intended to inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, a dinner or program includes a gala, dance, ball, theatrical or film presentation, cocktail or other party, picnic, barbecue, sporting event, brunch, tea, supper, auction, bazaar, reading, speech, forum, lecture, fashion show, concert, opening, meeting, gathering, or any similar event. For the definition of inurement of proceeds to a political party or a political candidate and of admission to a dinner or program, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Admission to inaugural event. (1) No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for admission to an inaugural ball, inaugural gala, inaugural parade, or inaugural concert, or to any similar event (such as a dinner or program, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in connection with the inauguration or installation in office of any official, or any equivalent event for an unsuccessful candidate, if the event is identified with a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, the sponsorship of the event and the use to which the proceeds of the event are or may be put are irrelevant, except insofar as they may tend to identify the event with a political party or a political candidate. For the definition of admission to an inaugural event, see paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for admission to an inaugural ball, inaugural gala, inaugural parade, or inaugural concert, or to any similar event (such as a dinner or program, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in connection with the inauguration or installation in office of any official, or any equivalent event for an unsuccessful candidate, if the event is identified with a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, the sponsorship of the event and the use to which the proceeds of the event are or may be put are irrelevant, except insofar as they may tend to identify the event with a political party or a political candidate. For the definition of admission to an inaugural event, see paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. An inaugural reception for A, a prominent member of Y party who has been recently elected judge of the municipal court of F city, is held with the proceeds going to the city treasury. The price of admission to such affair is not deductible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definitions--(1) Political party. For purposes of this section the term political party has the same meaning as that provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.271-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Political party. For purposes of this section the term political party has the same meaning as that provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.271-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Political candidate. For purposes of this section, the term political candidate is to be construed in accordance with the purpose of section 276 to deny tax deductions for certain expenditures which may be used directly or indirectly to finance political campaigns. The term includes a person who, at the time of the event or publication with respect to which the deduction is being sought, has been selected or nominated by a political party for any elective office. It also includes an individual who is generally believed, under the facts and circumstances at the time of the event or publication, by the persons making expenditures in connection

therewith to be an individual who is or who in the reasonably foreseeable future will be seeking selection, nomination, or election to any public office. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the purpose of the event or publication and the disposition to be made of the proceeds. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it shall be presumed that persons making expenditures in connection with an event or publication generally believe that an incumbent of an elective public office will run for reelection to his office or for election to some other public office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inurement of proceeds to political party or political candidate--(i) In general. Subject to the special rules presented in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (relating to a political candidate), proceeds directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate (a) if the party or candidate may order the disposition of any part of such proceeds, regardless of what use is actually made thereof, or (b) if any part of such proceeds is utilized by any person for the benefit of the party or candidate. These conditions are equally applicable in determining whether the proceeds are intended to inure. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether the event or publication operates at a loss if, had there been a profit, any part of the proceeds would have inured to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. Moreover, it shall be presumed that where a dinner, program, or publication is sponsored by or identified with a political party or political candidate, the proceeds of such dinner, program, or publication directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of the party or candidate. On the other hand, proceeds are not considered to directly or indirectly inure to the benefit of a political party or political candidate if the benefit derived is so remote as to be negligible or merely a coincidence of the relationship of a political candidate to a trade or business profiting from an expenditure of funds. For example, the proceeds of expenditures made by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business for advertising in a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, are not considered as inuring to the benefit of a political party or political candidate merely because the publication endorses a particular political candidate or candidates of a particular political party, the publisher independently contributes to the support of a political party or candidate out of his own personal funds, or the principal stockholder of the publishing firm is a candidate for public office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Subject to the special rules presented in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (relating to a political candidate), proceeds directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate (a) if the party or candidate may order the disposition of any part of such proceeds, regardless of what use is actually made thereof, or (b) if any part of such proceeds is utilized by any person for the benefit of the party or candidate. These conditions are equally applicable in determining whether the proceeds are intended to inure. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether the event or publication operates at a loss if, had there been a profit, any part of the proceeds would have inured to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. Moreover, it shall be presumed that where a dinner, program, or publication is sponsored by or identified with a political party or political candidate, the proceeds of such dinner, program, or publication directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of the party or candidate. On the other hand, proceeds are not considered to directly or indirectly inure to the benefit of a political party or political candidate if the benefit derived is so remote as to be negligible or merely a coincidence of the relationship of a political candidate to a trade or business profiting from an expenditure of funds. For example, the proceeds of expenditures made by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business for advertising in a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, are not considered as inuring to the benefit of a political party or political candidate merely because the publication endorses a particular political candidate or candidates of a particular political party, the publisher independently contributes to the support of a political party or candidate out of his own personal funds, or the principal stockholder of the publishing firm is a candidate for public office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proceeds to political party. If a political party may order the disposition of any part of the proceeds of a publication or event described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, such proceeds inure to the use of the party regardless of what the proceeds are to be used for or that their use is restricted to a particular purpose unrelated to the election of specific candidates for public office. Accordingly, where a political party holds a dinner for the purpose of raising funds to be used in a voter registration drive, voter education program, or nonprofit political research program, partisan or nonpartisan, the proceeds are considered to directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of the political party. Proceeds may inure to or for the use of a political party even though they are to be used for purposes which may not be directly related to any particular election (such as to pay office rent for its permanent quarters, salaries to permanent employees, or utilities charges, or to pay the cost of an event such as a dinner or program as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proceeds to political candidate. Proceeds directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate if, in addition to meeting the conditions described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, (a) some part of the proceeds is or may be used directly or indirectly for the purpose of furthering his candidacy for selection, nomination, or election to any elective public office, and (b) they are not received by him in the ordinary course of a trade or business (other than the trade or business of holding public office). Proceeds may so inure whether or not the expenditure sought to be deducted was

paid or incurred before the commencement of political activities with respect to the selection, nomination, or election referred to in (a) of this subdivision, or after such selection, nomination, or election has been made or has taken place. For example, proceeds of an event which may be used by an individual who, under the facts and circumstances at the time of the event, the persons making expenditures in connection therewith generally believe will in the reasonably foreseeable future run for a public office, and which may be used in furtherance of such individual's candidacy, generally will be deemed to inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering such individual's candidacy. Or, as another example, proceeds of an event occurring after an election, which may be used by a candidate in that election to repay loans incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, or in reimbursement of expenses incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, will be deemed to directly or indirectly inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. For purposes of this subdivision, if the proceeds received by a candidate exceed substantially the fair market value of the goods furnished or services rendered by him, the proceeds are not received by the candidate in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Corporation O pays the Y political party $100,000 per annum for the right to publish the Y News, and retains the entire proceeds from the sale of the publication. Amounts paid or incurred for advertising in the Y News are not deductible because a part of the proceeds thereof indirectly inures to or for the use of a political party.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. The X political party holds a highly publicized ball honoring one of its active party members and admission tickets are offered to all. The guest of honor is a prominent national figure and a former incumbent of a high public office. The price of admission is designed to cover merely the cost of entertainment, food, and the ballroom, and all proceeds are paid to the hotel where the function is held, with the political party bearing the cost of any deficit. No deduction may be taken for the price of admission to the ball since the proceeds thereof inure to or for the use of a political party.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Taxpayer A, engaged in a trade or business, purchases a number of tickets for admission to a fundraising affair held on behalf of political candidate B. The funds raised by this affair can be used by B for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. These expenditures are not deductible by A notwithstanding that B donates the proceeds of the affair to a charitable organization.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. A, an individual taxpayer who publishes a newspaper, is a candidate for elective public office. X Corporation advertises its products in A's newspaper, paying substantially more than the normal rate for such advertising. X Corporation may not deduct any portion of the cost of that advertising.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Admission to dinners, programs, inaugural events. For purposes of this section, the cost of admission to a dinner, program, or inaugural event includes all charges, whether direct or indirect, for attendance and participation at such function. Thus, for example, amounts spent to be eligible for door prizes, for the privilege of sitting at the head table, or for transportation furnished as part of such an event, or any separate charges for food or drink, are amounts paid for admission.
