                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carr Inlet, naval restricted areas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The area. The Waters of  Carr Inlet bounded on the southeast by a line running from Gibson Point  on Fox Island to Hyde Point on McNeil Island, on the northwest by a line  running from Green Point (at latitude 471654" N, longitude 1224133"  W) to Penrose Point; plus that portion of Pitt Passage extending from  Carr Inlet to Pitt Island, and that portion of Hale Passage extending  from Carr Inlet southeasterly to a line drawn perpendicular to the  channel 500 yards northwesterly of the Fox Island Bridge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The regulations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The area shall be used as an acoustic range  for research studies and special noise trials. No explosive shall be  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No marine craft of any type shall at anytime approach or remain  within one hundred yards of the hydrophone buoys. The hydrophone buoys  will be anchored in Carr Inlet on a line perpendicular to the course  line opposite Ketner's Point, and about one mile from the Fox Island  shore. The course line, or range, will bear 1343821" (3143821")  true, and will be marked by range beacons erected near the shoreline  approximately one mile north-northeast of of Steilacoom and  approximately two miles north-northeast of Home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Buoy Testing Area. No vessel shall, at anytime, anchor or tow  a drag of any kind within 1,000 yards of the buoy testing area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The remainder of the area shall be open to navigation at all  times except when the range is in use or when   hydrophones are being calibrated. When the range is in use or  hydrophones are being calibrated, quick flashing beacon lights will be  displayed on signal towers located at Gibson Point, Green Point, Penrose  Point, Pitt Island and Hyde Point. These beacon lights will be either  red or green. The beacon lights will show quick flashing every two  seconds. The ranging of vessels or calibration of hydrophones requiring  retrictions will be conducted 24 hours per day for up to 5 days  consecutively, and will total approximately 150 days spread throughout  the year. Shutting off of beacon lights will indicate termination of use  of the range. Insofar as possible, the schedule of operations giving the  days the range will be in use for each forthcoming month will be  published in local newspapers and in the local U.S. Coast Guart Notice  to Mariners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When the red beacon lights are displayed, indicating that the  range is in use or hydrophones are being calibrated, navigation within  the area will be restricted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As used in this section, the words ``operate, power vessel, and  non-power vessel'' are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Operate'': To be physically present in the designated area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Power vessel'': A vessel propelled principally by a mechanical  propulsion system (i.e., gasoline, diesel, steam or electric drive to a  propeller, pump jet, paddle wheel or other device), and being propelled  by that means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Non-power vessel'': A vessel not equipped with a mechanical  propulsion system, such as a rowboat, canoe, or sailboat propelled by  oars, paddles, or sails, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Power vessels shall not operate within the area, except that  traffic in either direction between Hale Passage and upper Carr Inlet,  within 200 yards of the low water mark off Green Point, will be cleared  by signal for approximately 15 minutes total time within this area at  the termination of individual ranging runs, while the vessel being  ranged takes position for the next run. Clearance to traverse the area  around Green Point will be indicated by extinguishing the red flashing  beacon lights and displaying the green flashing beacon lights on all  signal towers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Non-powered marine craft shall not operate within one mile of  the course line bearing 1343821" (3143821") true, and within two  miles to the southeast and two miles to the northwest of the hydrophone  buoys situated in Carr Inlet opposite Ketner's Point; provided, however,  non-powered craft may operate within four hundred yards of the low water  mark on the northeast side of McNeil Island, within two hundred yards of  the low water mark at Green Point, and within two hundred yards of the  low water mark on the southwest shore of Fox Island.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Towboats shall have free access and egress to designated tow  havens within Carr Inlet, as follows: The Navy will establish and  maintain suitable mooring buoys for the use of tugs and their tows at  the following points: (1) approximately 1,500 yards northwest of Gibson  Point Light and approximately 400 yards offshore from the low water mark  on the Fox Island shore; (2) approximately 1,500 yards northwest of Hyde  Point, and approximately 400 yards offshore from the low water mark on  McNeil Island shore; and (3) approximately 1,500 yards east of Wyckoff  Shoal. Towboats will signal by radio (Marine Band Channel 14, 13, 12, or  6) or telephone as far in advance as possible of the time they enter the  tow haven, such signals to be directed to ``Carr Inlet Range Control''  at the range instrument laboratory building located on Fox Island. The  Navy shall promptly suspend operations when necessary to permit the  access and egress of such tow traffic, and Carr Inlet Range Control  shall signal the tows when the area is clear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Through commercial traffic, including tows, to points within  Carr Inlet, and through Carr Inlet, Pitt Passage, and Hale Passage to  adjacent waters will be permitted free access and egress, as follows:  Such traffic will signal by radio (Marine Band Channel 14, 13, 12, or 6)  or telephone as far in advance as possible of the time they enter the  area, such signals to be directed to ``Carr Inlet Range Control'' at the  range instrument laboratory located on Fox Island. The Navy shall   promptly suspend operations when necessary to permit the passage of such  traffic, and Carr Inlet Range Control shall signal when the area is  clear for passage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Warden of the McNeil Island penitentiary and his authorized  representatives shall be permitted to operate within the area at any  time, as may be necessary, for the patrol and search of escaped  convicts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Red or green signal flags will be displayed on the signal towers  in case of failure of the red or green beacon lights. The display or the  signal flags at the top of the flag masts will have the same  significance as the beacon lights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The regulations in this paragraph shall be enforced by the  Commander, Naval Base, Seattle, and such agencies as he/she may  designate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [26 FR 11203, Nov. 28, 1961. Redesignated at 50 FR 42696, Oct. 22, 1985]</p><p class="depth0">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting  Sec. 334.1250, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in  the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.</p>
