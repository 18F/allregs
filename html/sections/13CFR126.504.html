                                Sec. 126.504  When is a concern removed from the List?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If SBA determines at any time that a HUBZone SBC is not qualified, SBA may de-certify the HUBZone SBC, remove the concern from the List, and seek imposition of penalties pursuant to Sec. 126.900. An adverse finding in the resolution of a protest also may result in de-certification and removal from the List, and the imposition of penalties pursuant to Sec. 126.900. Failure to notify SBA of a material change which could affect a concern's eligibility will result in immediate de-certification, removal from the List, and SBA may seek the imposition of penalties under Sec. 126.900.
