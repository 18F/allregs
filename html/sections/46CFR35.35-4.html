                                Sec. 35.35-4  Insulating flange joint or nonconductive hose--TB/ALL.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A vessel's cargo hose string or vapor recovery hose must use an  insulating flange or one continuous length of nonconductive hose between  the vessel and the shore transfer facility. For each vapor recovery hose  or cargo hose string, only one insulating flange or non-conductive hose  must be provided. See 33 CFR 154.2101(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The insulating flange must be inserted at the jetty end and take  all reasonable measures to ensure the connection will not be disturbed.  The hose must be suspended to ensure the hose-to-hose connection flanges  do not rest on the jetty deck or other structure that may render the  insulating flange ineffective or short circuited by contact with  external metal or through the hose handling equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The insulating flange must be inspected and tested at least  annually, or more frequently if necessary due to deterioration caused by  environmental exposure, usage, and damage from handling. After  installation, the insulation reading between the metal pipe on the shore  side of the flange and the end of the hose or metal arm when freely  suspended must not be less than 1,000 ohms. A suitable DC insulation  tester must be used.  [USCG-1999-5150, 78 FR 42641, July 16, 2013]</p>
