In the event of the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification of a member, his or her first alternate shall act as a member until a successor for the member is selected and has qualified. The second alternate for a member shall serve in the place and stead of the member for whom he or she is an alternate whenever both the member and his or her first alternate are unable to serve. In the event that a member of the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee and both that member's alternates are unable to attend a meeting, the member may designate any other alternate member from the same group (handler, processor, or grower) to serve in that member's place and stead.</p>
