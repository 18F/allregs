                            <p class="depth0">A manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor may return to his factory or export warehouse, without internal revenue supervision when so authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes previously removed therefrom, under this part, but not yet exported. The manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor shall, prior to returning the articles to his factory or export warehouse, make application to the appropriate TTB officer for permission so to do, which application shall be accompanied by two copies of the notice of removal, Form 5200.14, under which the articles were originally removed. If less than the entire shipment is intended to be returned to the factory or export warehouse, the application shall

set forth accurately the articles to be returned and shall show what disposition was made of the remainder of the original shipment and any other facts pertinent to such shipment. Where the appropriate TTB officer approves the application, he shall so indicate by endorsement to that effect on each of the copies of the notice of removal, set forth the articles for which return is approved, and return both copies of the notice of removal to the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor concerned. Upon receipt of the copies of the notice of removal bearing the endorsement of the appropriate TTB officer, the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor shall return the articles to his factory or export warehouse, properly modify and execute the certificate of receipt on each copy of the notice of removal, return one such copy to the appropriate TTB officer, and retain the other copy as a part of his records.
