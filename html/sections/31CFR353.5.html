                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Registration is conclusive of ownership. Definitive savings  bonds were issued only in registered form. The registration must express  the actual ownership of, and interest in, the bond. The registration is  conclusive of ownership, except as provided in Sec. 353.49.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for registration. Registrations requested must be  clear, accurate and complete, conform substantially with one of the  forms set forth in this subpart, and include the taxpayer identifying  number of the owner or first-named coowner. The taxpayer identifying  number of the second-named coowner or beneficiary is not required but  its inclusion is desirable. The registration of all bonds owned by the  same person, organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect  to the name of the owner and any description of the fiduciary capacity.  An individual should be designated by the name he or she is ordinarily  known by or uses in business, including at least one full given name.  The name may be preceded or followed by any applicable title, such as  Miss, Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Rev., M.D., or D.D.. A suffix, such as Sr. or  Jr., must be included when ordinarily used or when necessary to  distinguish the owner from another member of his family. A married  woman's own given name, not that of her husband, must be used; for  example, Mary A. Jones or Mrs. Mary A. Jones, NOT Mrs. Frank B. Jones.  The address must include, where appropriate, the number and street,  route, or any other local feature, city, State, and ZIP Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Registration of bonds purchased as gifts. If the bonds were  purchased as gifts, awards, prizes, etc., and the taxpayer identifying  numbers of the intended owners are not known, the purchaser's number  must be furnished. Bonds so inscribed will not be associated with the  purchaser's own holdings. Bonds so registered will not be associated  with the purchaser's own holdings. If the purchaser so requests, a   bond may be inscribed to provide a ``Mail to'' instruction, followed by  a delivery name and address. No rights of ownership are conferred on  such designee.
