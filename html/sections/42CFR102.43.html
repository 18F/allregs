All eligibility documentation required by the Program should be filed together with the Request Form. However, if this is not possible, a requester will satisfy the filing deadline as long as the signed Request Form is completed (to the fullest extent possible) and submitted within the governing filing deadline described in Sec.  102.42. The Secretary will not generally begin his review of a requester's eligibility until the documentation necessary for the Secretary to make this determination has been submitted. All such documentation must be submitted before the Program terminates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation for benefits determinations. Although the Secretary will accept documentation required to make benefits determinations (i.e., calculate benefits available, if any) at the time the Request Form is filed or any time thereafter, requesters need not submit such documentation until they have been notified that the Secretary has determined eligibility. The Secretary will not generally begin his review of the benefits available to a requester until the documentation necessary for the Secretary to make a benefits determination has been submitted. All such documentation must be submitted before the Program terminates.</p>
