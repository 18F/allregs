If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.

Equivalent diameter = 2(length)(width)/(length + width)

The sampling point in the duct is to be at the centroid of the cross section. The sample is to be extracted at a rate proportional to the gas velocity at the sampling point. The sample is to contain a minimum volume of 50 liters (1.8 ft\3\) corrected to standard conditions and is to be taken over a period as close to 1 hour as practicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each emission test is to consist of three runs.
