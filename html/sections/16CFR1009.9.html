                                Sec. 1009.9  Policy regarding the granting of emergency exemptions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This document states the Consumer Product Safety Commission's  policy with respect to emergency requests for exemptions for companies  which inadvertently produce products that do not conform to Commission  regulations issued under the five acts the Commission administers. These  acts are the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous  Substances Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Poison Prevention  Packaging Act of 1970 and the Refrigerator Safety Act. While the  Commission is reluctant to grant such requests, it believes that the  public should be apprised of the manner in which it rules on exemption  requests and therefore is publishing the policy to provide guidance to  industry and others making such requests. The publication of the policy  will also serve to inform the public of the criteria that the Commission  uses in ruling upon such requests. This policy is intended to cover  emergency requests for exemptions and, while relevant, is not intended  to limit the discretion of CPSC staff to close or not to open cases in  the routine enforcement of CPSC regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The policy governs requests for exemption from any regulation  under any act the Commission administers. The policy lists criteria the  Commission considers in deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption  request and therefore, should provide guidance to companies on the types  of information to be submitted with requests. In addition, published  Commission procedures regarding petitioning for amendments to  regulations may assist companies in determining what supporting data to  submit with a request. (See, for example, existing Commission procedures  at 16 CFR 1110, 16 CFR 1607.14, 16 CFR 1500.82 and 16 CFR 1500.201). The  exemption requests themselves should be filed with the Office of the  Secretary of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is the general policy of the Commission that when a  particular exemption request is made and granted, all similarly situated  persons are accorded the same relief as the person who requested the  exemption. Therefore, when any amendment to a Commission regulation is  proposed or a statement of enforcement policy is issued, the document to  the extent practicable will be phrased in objective terms so that all  similarly situated persons will be able to determine whether their  products would fall within the relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption request, the  Commission considers the following general criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The degree to which the exemption if granted would expose  consumers to an increased risk of injury: The Commission does not  believe it should exempt products which would present a significantly  greater risk to consumers than complying products. Therefore, the  Commission will not grant exemption requests in such cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost to the Commission of granting emergency requests:  Granting emergency exemption requests will in most cases require  drafting a proposed and a final amendment or a statement of enforcement  policy for publication in the Federal Register. Such action may also  require the Commission to monitor the sale or distribution of the  products. These activities consume scarce Commission resources. In some  instances, the costs to the Commission may exceed the benefit to be  derived by a company and similarly situated companies. If so, the  Commission may deny the request on this ground.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The precedential effect of exempting some products: The  Commission recognizes that decisions to exempt some products set  precedents in at least two ways. First, they indicate to companies that  the CPSC will permit deviations to a given regulation. Second, they  indicate to companies that the CPSC will permit deviations to  regulations in general. Both precedents, if set carelessly by the CPSC,  could result in many requests for exemption and could   undermine the stability and integrity of the Commission's regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption request, the  Commission also considers the following factors which relate  specifically to the company making the request: (If the request is  granted, all similarly situated companies, however, will be accorded the  same relief).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of the emergency exemption request: The Commission  will not reward bad quality control or faulty design work by permitting  companies to market their mistakes. Although it is difficult to detail  specific instances, the Commission is sympathetic to companies that  produced noncomplying products due to factors beyond their immediate  control or despite their best efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The economic loss which a company will suffer if its emergency  request is denied: The greater the loss a company may suffer the more  likely the Commission will favorably consider an exemption. However, the  Commission does not believe economic loss alone should be determinative  of an emergency exemption request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fairness to competitors: The Commission is reluctant to  grant relief if it could place the company at an unfair competitive  advantage over other companies which have successfully complied with the  same regulation. Therefore, the Commission will afford the same relief  to similarly situated companies, and will decline to grant a request  where unfair competitive advantage may result.
