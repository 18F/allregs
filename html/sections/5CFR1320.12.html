                            <p class="depth0">Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in  current rules that were published as final rules in the Federal Register  in accordance with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a collection of information contained in a  published current rule which has been approved by OMB and has a  currently valid OMB control number, the agency shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct the review established under Sec. 1320.8, including the  seeking of public comment under Sec. 1320.8(d); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment,  but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the OMB control  number for the currently approved collection of information, submit the  collection of information for review and approval under this part, which  shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information  that it has collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a collection of information contained in a  published current rule that was not required to be submitted for OMB  review under the Paperwork Reduction Act at the time the collection of  information was made part of the rule, but which collection of  information is now subject to the Act and this part, the agency shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct the review established under Sec. 1320.8, including the  seeking of public comment under Sec. 1320(8)(d); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment,  submit the collection of information for review and approval under this  part, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the  information that it has collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of  information while the submission is pending at OMB. In the case of a  collection of information not previously approved, approval shall be  granted for such period, which shall not exceed 60 days, unless extended  by the Director for an additional 60 days, and an OMB control number  assigned. Upon assignment of the OMB control number, and in accordance  with Sec. 1320.3(f) and Sec. 1320.5(b), the agency shall display the  number and inform the potential persons who are to respond to the  collection of information that such persons are not required to respond  to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid  OMB control number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On or before the day of submission to OMB under paragraphs (a)  or (b) of this section, the agency shall, in accordance with the  requirements set forth in Sec. 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), forward a notice to the  Federal Register stating that OMB review is being sought. The notice  shall direct requests for copies of the collection of information and  supporting documentation to the agency, and shall request that comments  be submitted to OMB within 30 days of the notice's publication. The  notice shall direct comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for [name of agency]. A copy of  the notice submitted to the Federal Register, together with the date of  expected publication, shall be included in the agency's submission to  OMB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 60 days after receipt of the collection of information or  publication of the notice under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever  is later, OMB shall notify the agency involved of its decision to  approve, to instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change  to, or to disapprove, the collection of information, and shall make such  decision publicly available. OMB shall provide at least 30 days for  public comment after receipt of the proposed collection of information  before making its decision, except as provided under Sec. 1320.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon approval of a collection of information, OMB shall  assign an OMB control number and an expiration date. OMB shall not  approve any collection of information for a period longer than three  years. Approval of any collection   of information submitted under this section will be for the full three- year period, unless OMB determines that there are special circumstances  requiring approval for a shorter period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If OMB fails to notify the agency of its approval, instruction  to make substantive or material change, or disapproval within the 60-day  period, the agency may request, and OMB shall assign without further  delay, an OMB control number that shall be valid for not more than one  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As provided in Sec. 1320.5(b) and Sec. 1320.6(a), an agency may  not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless the collection  of information displays a currently valid OMB control number and the  agency informs potential persons who are to respond to the collection of  information that such persons are not required to respond to the  collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB  control number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If OMB disapproves a collection of information contained in  an existing rule, or instructs the agency to make a substantive or  material change to a collection of information contained in an existing  rule, OMB shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Publish an explanation thereof in the Federal Register; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Instruct the agency to undertake a rulemaking within a  reasonable time limited to consideration of changes to the collection of  information contained in the rule and thereafter to submit the  collection of information for approval or disapproval under Sec. 1320.10  or Sec. 1320.11, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Extend the existing approval of the collection of information  (including an interim approval granted under paragraph (b) of this  section) for the duration of the period required for consideration of  proposed changes, including that required for OMB approval or  disapproval of the collection of information under Sec. 1320.10 or  Sec. 1320.11, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thereafter, the agency shall, within a reasonable period of time  not to exceed 120 days, undertake such procedures as are necessary in  compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable  law to amend or rescind the collection of information, and shall notify  the public through the Federal Register. Such notice shall identify the  proposed changes in the collections of information and shall solicit  public comment on retention, change, or rescission of such collections  of information. If the agency employs notice and comment rulemaking  procedures for amendment or rescission of the collection of information,  publication of the above in the Federal Register and submission to OMB  shall initiate OMB clearance procedures under section 3507(d) of the Act  and Sec. 1320.11. All procedures shall be completed within a reasonable  period of time to be determined by OMB in consultation with the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> OMB may disapprove, in whole or in part, any collection of  information subject to the procedures of this section, if the agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has refused within a reasonable time to comply with an OMB  instruction to submit the collection of information for review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has refused within a reasonable time to initiate procedures to  change the collection of information; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has refused within a reasonable time to publish a final rule  continuing the collection of information, with such changes as may be  appropriate, or otherwise complete the procedures for amendment or  rescission of the collection of information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> Upon disapproval by OMB of a collection of information  subject to this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of  this section, the OMB control number assigned to such collection of  information shall immediately expire, and no agency shall conduct or  sponsor such collection of information. Any such disapproval shall  constitute disapproval of the collection of information contained in the  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or other submissions, and also of the  preexisting information collection instruments directed at the same  collection of information and therefore constituting essentially the  same collection of information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The failure to display a currently valid OMB control number for  a collection of information contained in a current rule, or the failure  to inform the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of  information that such   persons are not required to respond to the collection of information  unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number, does not, as a  legal matter, rescind or amend the rule; however, such absence will  alert the public that either the agency has failed to comply with  applicable legal requirements for the collection of information or the  collection of information has been disapproved, and that therefore the  portion of the rule containing the collection of information has no  legal force and effect and the public protection provisions of 44 U.S.C.  3512 apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the expiration of OMB's approval of a collection of  information in a current rule, OMB may decide on its own initiative,  after consultation with the agency, to review the collection of  information. Such decisions will be made only when relevant  circumstances have changed or the burden estimates provided by the  agency at the time of initial submission were materially in error. Upon  notification by OMB of its decision to review the collection of  information, the agency shall submit it to OMB for review under this  Part.</p>
