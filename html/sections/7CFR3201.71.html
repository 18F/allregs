                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition. (1) Pigmented liquids, formulated for use indoors, that dry to form a film and provide protection and added color to the objects or surfaces to which they are applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interior paints and coatings products for which Federal preferred procurement applies are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interior latex and waterborne alkyd paints and coatings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interior oil-based and solventborne alkyd paints and coatings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minimum biobased content. The minimum biobased content for all interior paints and coatings products shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents for the Federal preferred procurement products are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interior latex and waterborne alkyd paints and coatings--20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interior oil-based and solventborne alkyd paints and coatings--67 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Preference compliance date. No later than July 23, 2012, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased interior paints and coatings. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased interior paints and coatings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determining overlap with an EPA-designated recovered content product. Qualifying biobased products within the interior latex and waterborne alkyd paints and coatings subcategory may, in some cases, overlap with the EPA-designated recovered content products: Reprocessed latex paints and consolidated latex paints. USDA is requesting that manufacturers of these qualifying biobased products provide information on the USDA Web site of qualifying biobased products about the intended uses of the product, information on whether or not the product contains any recovered material, in addition to biobased ingredients, and performance standards against which the product has been tested. This information will assist Federal agencies in determining whether or not a qualifying biobased product overlaps with EPA-designated reprocessed latex paints and consolidated latex paints and which product should be afforded the preference in purchasing.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d): Biobased interior latex and waterborne alkyd paints and coatings products within this subcategory can compete with similar reprocessed latex paint and consolidated latex paint products with recycled content. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, section 6002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated reprocessed latex paints and consolidated latex paints containing recovered materials as items for which Federal agencies must give preference in their purchasing programs. The designation can be found in the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline, 40 CFR 247.12.
