                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adjustments for factors not reflected or inappropriately  reflected in physical condition score. Under circumstances described in  this section, HUD may determine it is appropriate to review the results  of a project's physical inspection that are unusual or incorrect due to  facts and circumstances affecting the PHA's project that are not  reflected in the inspection or that are reflected inappropriately in the  inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section may include inconsistencies between local code  requirements and the HUD physical inspection protocol; conditions that  are permitted by local variance or license or which are preexisting  physical features that do not conform to, or are inconsistent with,  HUD's physical condition protocol; or the project or PHA having been  scored for elements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, mail boxes, resident-owned  appliances, etc.) that it does not own and is not responsible for  maintaining. To qualify for an adjustment on this basis, the project or  PHA must have notified the proper authorities regarding the deficient  element.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An adjustment due to these circumstances may be initiated by a  project or PHA's notification to the applicable HUD field office, and  such notification shall include appropriate proof of the reasons for the  unusual or incorrect result. Projects and PHAs may submit the request  for this adjustment either prior to or after the physical inspection has  been concluded. If the request is made after the conclusion of the  physical inspection, the request must be made within 45 days of issuance  of the project's or PHA's physical condition score. Based on the  recommendation of the applicable HUD office following its review of the  project evidence or documentation submitted by the project or PHA, HUD  may determine that a reinspection and/or rescoring of the project or PHA  is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments for adverse conditions beyond the control of the  PHA. Under certain circumstances, HUD may determine that certain  deficiencies that adversely and significantly affect the physical  condition score of the project were caused by circumstances beyond the  control of the PHA. The correction of these conditions, however, remains  the responsibility of the PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> are not those addressed  by the technical review process in Sec. 902.68.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To adjust a physical condition score based on circumstances  addressed in this paragraph, the PHA must submit a request to the  applicable HUD field office requesting a reinspection or rescoring of  the PHA's project(s) dependent on the severity of the deficiency. The  request must be submitted within 45 days of the issuance of the physical  condition score to the PHA. If the PHA is requesting a reinspection, the  request must be accompanied by a certification that all deficiencies  identified in the original report have been corrected. Based on the  recommendation of the applicable HUD office following its review of the  project's or PHA's evidence or documentation, HUD may determine that a  reinspection and rescoring of the PHA's project(s) is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments for modernization work in progress. HUD may  determine that occupied dwelling units or other areas of a PHA's  project, which are subject   to physical inspection under this subpart, and which are undergoing  modernization work, require an adjustment to the physical condition  score.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An occupied dwelling unit or other areas of a PHA's project  undergoing modernization are subject to physical inspection; the unit(s)  and other areas of the PHA's project are not exempt from physical  inspection. All elements of the unit or of the other areas of the PHA's  project that are subject to inspection and are not undergoing  modernization at the time of the inspection (even if modernization is  planned) will be subject to HUD's physical inspection protocol without  adjustment. For those elements of the unit or of the project that are  undergoing modernization, deficiencies will be noted in accordance with  HUD's physical inspection protocol, but the project or PHA may request  adjustment of the physical condition score as a result of modernization  work in progress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An adjustment due to modernization work in progress may be  initiated by a project's or PHA's notification to the applicable HUD  field office, and the notification shall include supporting  documentation of the modernization work under way at the time of the  physical inspection. A project or PHA may submit the request for this  adjustment either prior to or after the physical inspection has been  concluded. If the request is made after the conclusion of the physical  inspection, the request must be made within 45 days of issuance of the  physical condition score. Based on the recommendation of the applicable  HUD office, HUD may determine that a reinspection and rescoring of the  PHA's project(s) are necessary.</p>
