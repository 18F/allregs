If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (e.g., expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> An audit of a MAP Participant as required by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 if the MAP is the MAP Participant's largest source of Federal funding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> The translation of written materials as necessary to carry out approved activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing Web sites on the Internet that clearly target a foreign audience;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> International travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304), incurred for a foreign trade mission conducted outside the United States that is an activity under an approved branded program and that has met the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the MAP Participant's UES;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trade mission included representatives, as defined in Sec. 1485.17(b)(8), from a minimum of five

Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this subsection, on a case by case basis, where: the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, or a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the MAP Participant in writing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Contracts with U.S. based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a MAP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (e.g., a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S. based organization provides administrative services to the MAP Participant's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, but for generic promotion activities only, CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Approved supergrade salaries for non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where there is a local U.S. Embassy Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan, except for approved supergrades, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where an FSN salary plan does not exist, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds locally prevailing levels, which the MAP Participant shall document by a salary survey or other means, except for approved supergrades;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved MAP-funded overseas offices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross salary of a GS-15, Step 10 for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)(i)</em> Subject to Sec. 1485.17(b)(18), international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: (1) A food or agricultural show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, (2) an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country, and (3) an exhibit or show that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which MAP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to MAP Participants via a MAP notice issued on FAS' Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to Sec. 1485.17(b)(18), international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: (1) A food or agricultural show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, (2) an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country, and (3) an exhibit or show that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which MAP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to MAP Participants via a MAP notice issued on FAS' Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the MAP Participant fails to notify the Attach[eacute]/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel, unless the CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notice. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In very limited circumstances, the MAP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate (i.e., a premium class rate other than the first class rate) upon prior written approval by CCC. Such circumstances are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the MAP Participant receives written documentation from its travel agent to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (e.g., weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with

multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14 hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Organization costs for overseas offices approved in MAP program agreements.

MAP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions.

The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. MAP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines.

Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is: (1) A food or agricultural show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, (2) an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country, and (3) an exhibit or show that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP.

Where the non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/or offices in more than one country, the MAP Participant may request approval for a ``Supergrade II'' salary level, which is calculated relative to a ``Supergrade I'' in the same way the latter is calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another foreign country or countries shall not be considered a non-U.S. citizen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For a brand promotion activity, CCC will reimburse no more than 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures made on that activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a MAP Participant's program year provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The activity was approved by CCC prior to the end of the program year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> A MAP Participant shall not use MAP funds for any activity or any expenses incurred by the MAP Participant prior to the date of the program agreement or after the date the program agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, MAP-funded travel shall conform to U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and MAP-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118).
