                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided for under Sec. 1415.17, only landowners may  submit applications for easements. For rental contracts, applicants must  own or provide written evidence of control of the property for the  duration of the rental contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The easement or rental contract will require that the area be  maintained in accordance with GRP goals and objectives for the term of  the easement or rental contract, including the conservation, protection,  enhancement, and if necessary, restoration of the grassland functions  and values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All participants in GRP are required to implement a GRP  management plan approved by NRCS. When an eligible entity holds the GRP  easement, NRCS will develop GRP management plans with eligible entities.  In cases where a participant receives ranking points on the basis of  resource concerns other than grazing land concerns, all such resource  concerns will be addressed in an applicable conservation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The easement or rental contract must grant USDA or its  representatives a right of ingress and egress to the easement or rental  contract area. For easements, this access is legally described by the  conservation easement deed and the GRP management plan. Access to rental  contract areas is identified in the GRP management plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Easement participants are required to convey unencumbered title  that is acceptable to the United States and provide consent or  subordination agreements from each holder of a security or other  interest in the land. The landowner must warrant that the easement  granted the United States or eligible entity is superior to the rights  of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed  acceptable by USDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Landowners are required to use a standard GRP conservation  easement deed developed by USDA or developed by an eligible entity and  approved by USDA under Sec. 1415.17 of this part. The easement grants  development rights, title, and interest in the easement area in order to  protect grassland and other conservation values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The program participant must comply with the terms of the  easement or rental contract, and comply with all terms and conditions of  the GRP management plan and any associated conservation plan or  restoration agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Easements and rental contracts allow, consistent with their  terms and the program purposes, the following activities as outlined in  the GRP management plan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Common grazing practices, including maintenance and necessary  conservation practices and activities (e.g., prescribed grazing; upland  wildlife habitat management; prescribed burning; fencing, watering, and  feeding necessary for the raising of livestock; and related forage and  seed production) on the land in a manner that is consistent with  maintaining the viability of grassland, forb, and shrub species common  to the locality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Haying, mowing, or harvesting for seed production subject to  appropriate restrictions, as determined by the State Conservationist,  during the nesting season for birds in the local area that are in  significant decline, or are conserved in accordance with Federal or  State law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fire pre-suppression, rehabilitation, and construction of  firebreaks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Grazing related activities, such as fencing and livestock  watering facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Facilities for power generation through renewable sources of  energy production provided the scope and scale of the footprint of the  facility and associated infrastructure is consistent with program  purposes as determined by USDA through analysis of the potential site- specific environmental effects; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other activities that USDA determines the manner, number,  intensity, location, operation, and other features associated with the  activity will not adversely affect the grassland resources or related  conservation values protected under an easement or rental contract. This  includes infrastructure development along existing right-of-ways where  the easement deed allows the landowner to grant right-of-ways when it is  determined by NRCS that granting such right-of-ways are in the public  interest, that grassland resources and related conservation values will  not be adversely impacted, and the landowner agrees to a restoration  plan for the disturbed area as developed by NRCS, but at no cost to  NRCS. This also includes undeveloped, passive, recreational uses such as  hiking, camping, bird watching, hunting, and fishing as long as such  uses, as determined by the grantee, do not impair the grazing uses and  other conservation values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Easement and rental contracts prohibit the following activities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The production of crops (other than hay), orchards, vineyards,  or other agricultural commodity that is inconsistent with maintaining  grazing land and related conservation values; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as permitted under a restoration plan, the conduct of any  other activity that would be inconsistent with maintaining grazing uses  and related conservation values protected under an easement or rental  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Rental contracts may be terminated by USDA without penalty or  refund if the original participant dies, is declared legally  incompetent, or is otherwise unavailable during the contract period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Participants, with the agreement of USDA, may convert a rental  contract to an easement, provided that funds are available and the  project meets conditions established by USDA. Land cannot be enrolled in  both a rental contract option and an easement enrollment option at the  same time. The rental contract will be terminated prior to the date the  easement is recorded in the local land records office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Rental contract participants are required to suspend any  existing cropland base and allotment history for the land under another  program administered by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Easement participants are required to eliminate any existing  cropland base and allotment history for the land under another program  administered by the Secretary.</p>
