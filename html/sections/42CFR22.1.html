However, any such officer or employee who was  entitled, on January 4, 1986, to receive additional pay by reason of  being assigned to full-time duty, for a period of 30 days or more, at a  station of the Service devoted to the care of Hansen's disease patients  and who continues to be assigned to such duty, shall receive special pay  as long as such assignment continues without a break.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such special pay shall, on any future date, be at an annual  dollar level equal to the lower of the levels that would be paid under  the following subparagraphs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 25% of the lowest level of basic pay that he or she has been  receiving on any date from January 4, 1986, through that future date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount by which the level of an employee's basic pay plus  special pay on January 4, 1986, exceeds the level of that employee's  basic pay on that on that future date, except that   the special pay under this subparagraph shall not be less that 12 times  the monthly special pay then paid to Commissioned Officers entitled to  special pay for duty involving intimate contact with persons who have  Hansen's disease. (As of October 24, 1985, that monthly rate was $110.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An officer or employee may be paid special pay for any pay  period, under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, only to the extent  that it does not cause his or her aggregate pay for that pay period to  exceed the biweekly rate of basic pay for Level V of the Executive  Schedule. As used in this paragraph, ``aggregate pay'' comprises basic  pay, this special pay, and premiums for overtime, nightwork, irregular  duty, standby status, and Sunday or holiday work.
