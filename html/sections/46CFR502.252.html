This statement shall  not include any shipments not covered by the findings of the Commission.  Complainant shall forward the statement, together with the paid freight  bills on the shipments, or true copies thereof, to the respondent or  other person who collected the charges for checking and certification as  to accuracy. Statements so prepared and certified shall be filed with  the Commission for consideration in determining the amount of reparation  due. Disputes concerning the accuracy of amounts may be assigned for  conference by the Commission, or in its discretion referred for further  hearing. [Rule 252.]</p>
