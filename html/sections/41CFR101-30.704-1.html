in the DLSC data base. This distribution will be made by coordination letters in which a time frame for a response will be specified.

All civil agencies (except direct submitters of catalog data to DLSC) will also be forwarded covering letters which will request specific information relative to implementing the studies; i.e., inventory levels of items coded ISC 3. Activities not responding within the time frame specified (60 calendar days) will receive a followup notice before being automatically withdrawn as users of all items coded as not authorized for procurement.
