                            <p class="depth0">When there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller  of the advertised product that might materially affect the weight or  credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is not reasonably  expected by the audience), such connection must be fully disclosed. For  example, when an endorser who appears in a television commercial is  neither represented in the advertisement as an expert nor is known to a  significant portion of the viewing public, then the advertiser should  clearly and conspicuously disclose either the payment or promise of  compensation prior to and in exchange for the endorsement or the fact  that the endorser knew or had reason to know or to believe that if the  endorsement favored the advertised product some benefit, such as an  appearance on television, would be extended to the endorser. Additional  guidance, including guidance concerning endorsements made through other  media, is provided by the examples below.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: A drug company commissions research on its product by an  outside organization. The drug company determines the overall subject of  the research (e.g., to test the efficacy of a newly developed product)  and pays a substantial share of the expenses of the research project,  but the research organization determines the protocol for the study and  is responsible for conducting it. A subsequent advertisement by the drug  company mentions the research results as the ``findings'' of that  research organization. Although the design and conduct of the research  project are controlled by the outside research organization, the weight  consumers place on the reported results could be materially affected by  knowing that the advertiser had funded the project. Therefore, the  advertiser's payment of expenses to the research organization should be  disclosed in this advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: A film star endorses a particular food product. The  endorsement regards only points of taste and individual preference. This  endorsement must, of course, comply with Sec. 255.1; but regardless of  whether the star's compensation for the commercial is a $1 million cash  payment or a royalty for each product sold by the advertiser during the  next year, no disclosure is required because such payments likely are  ordinarily expected by viewers.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3: During an appearance by a well-known professional tennis  player on a television talk show, the host comments that the past few  months have been the best of her career and during this time she has  risen to her highest level ever in the rankings. She responds by  attributing the improvement in her game to the fact that she is seeing  the ball better than she used to, ever since having laser vision  correction surgery at a clinic that she identifies by name. She  continues talking about the ease of the procedure, the kindness of the  clinic's doctors, her speedy recovery, and how she can now engage in a  variety of activities without glasses, including driving at night. The  athlete does not disclose that, even though she does not appear in  commercials for the clinic, she has a contractual relationship with it,  and her contract pays her for speaking publicly about her surgery when  she can do so. Consumers might not realize that a celebrity discussing a  medical procedure in a television interview has been paid for doing so,  and knowledge of such payments would likely affect the weight or  credibility consumers give to the celebrity's endorsement. Without a  clear and conspicuous disclosure that the athlete has been engaged as a  spokesperson for the clinic, this endorsement is likely to be deceptive.  Furthermore, if consumers are likely to take away from her story that  her experience was typical of those who undergo the same procedure at  the clinic, the advertiser must have substantiation for that claim.</p><p class="depth0">Assume that instead of speaking about the clinic in a television  interview, the tennis player touts the results of her surgery-- mentioning the clinic by name--on a social networking site that allows  her fans to read in real time what is happening in her life. Given the  nature of the medium in which her endorsement is disseminated, consumers  might not realize that she is a paid endorser. Because that information  might affect the weight consumers give to her endorsement,   her relationship with the clinic should be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">Assume that during that same television interview, the tennis player  is wearing clothes bearing the insignia of an athletic wear company with  whom she also has an endorsement contract. Although this contract  requires that she wear the company's clothes not only on the court but  also in public appearances, when possible, she does not mention them or  the company during her appearance on the show. No disclosure is required  because no representation is being made about the clothes in this  context.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4: An ad for an anti-snoring product features a physician  who says that he has seen dozens of products come on the market over the  years and, in his opinion, this is the best ever. Consumers would expect  the physician to be reasonably compensated for his appearance in the ad.  Consumers are unlikely, however, to expect that the physician receives a  percentage of gross product sales or that he owns part of the company,  and either of these facts would likely materially affect the credibility  that consumers attach to the endorsement. Accordingly, the advertisement  should clearly and conspicuously disclose such a connection between the  company and the physician.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5: An actual patron of a restaurant, who is neither known to  the public nor presented as an expert, is shown seated at the counter.  He is asked for his ``spontaneous'' opinion of a new food product served  in the restaurant. Assume, first, that the advertiser had posted a sign  on the door of the restaurant informing all who entered that day that  patrons would be interviewed by the advertiser as part of its TV  promotion of its new soy protein ``steak.'' This notification would  materially affect the weight or credibility of the patron's endorsement,  and, therefore, viewers of the advertisement should be clearly and  conspicuously informed of the circumstances under which the endorsement  was obtained.</p><p class="depth0">Assume, in the alternative, that the advertiser had not posted a  sign on the door of the restaurant, but had informed all interviewed  customers of the ``hidden camera'' only after interviews were completed  and the customers had no reason to know or believe that their response  was being recorded for use in an advertisement. Even if patrons were  also told that they would be paid for allowing the use of their opinions  in advertising, these facts need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6: An infomercial producer wants to include consumer  endorsements for an automotive additive product featured in her  commercial, but because the product has not yet been sold, there are no  consumer users. The producer's staff reviews the profiles of individuals  interested in working as ``extras'' in commercials and identifies  several who are interested in automobiles. The extras are asked to use  the product for several weeks and then report back to the producer. They  are told that if they are selected to endorse the product in the  producer's infomercial, they will receive a small payment. Viewers would  not expect that these ``consumer endorsers'' are actors who were asked  to use the product so that they could appear in the commercial or that  they were compensated. Because the advertisement fails to disclose these  facts, it is deceptive.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7: A college student who has earned a reputation as a video  game expert maintains a personal weblog or ``blog'' where he posts  entries about his gaming experiences. Readers of his blog frequently  seek his opinions about video game hardware and software. As it has done  in the past, the manufacturer of a newly released video game system  sends the student a free copy of the system and asks him to write about  it on his blog. He tests the new gaming system and writes a favorable  review. Because his review is disseminated via a form of consumer- generated media in which his relationship to the advertiser is not  inherently obvious, readers are unlikely to know that he has received  the video game system free of charge in exchange for his review of the  product, and given the value of the video game system, this fact likely  would materially affect the credibility they attach to his endorsement.  Accordingly, the blogger should clearly and conspicuously disclose that  he received the gaming system free of charge. The manufacturer should  advise him at the time it provides the gaming system that this  connection should be disclosed, and it should have procedures in place  to try to monitor his postings for compliance.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8: An online message board designated for discussions of new  music download technology is frequented by MP3 player enthusiasts. They  exchange information about new products, utilities, and the  functionality of numerous playback devices. Unbeknownst to the message  board community, an employee of a leading playback device manufacturer  has been posting messages on the discussion board promoting the  manufacturer's product. Knowledge of this poster's employment likely  would affect the weight or credibility of her endorsement. Therefore,  the poster should clearly and conspicuously disclose her relationship to  the manufacturer to members and readers of the message board.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9: A young man signs up to be part of a ``street team''  program in which points are awarded each time a team member talks to his  or her friends about a particular advertiser's products. Team members  can then exchange their points for prizes, such as concert tickets or  electronics. These incentives would materially affect the weight or  credibility of the team member's endorsements. They should be clearly  and conspicuously   disclosed, and the advertiser should take steps to ensure that these  disclosures are being provided.</p>
