Using the format prescribed by the application package, the Applicant must address each evaluation criterion identified below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performance Evaluation Criteria. The overall goal of this program and the projects it supports is to create and serve new markets, with a resulting increase in jobs, customer base and revenues returning to the producer. Applicants must provide specific information about plans to track and evaluate progress toward these outcomes as a way for the Agency to ascertain whether or not the primary program goals and project goals proposed in the work plan are likely to be accomplished during the project period. The application package will provide additional instruction to assist Applicants when responding to this criterion. The required data, including accomplishments as outlined in Sec. 4284.960 and Applicant-suggested performance criteria, will be incorporated into the Applicant's semi-annual and final reporting requirements if selected for award, and will be specified in the grant agreement associated with each award. At a minimum, data included in each application submission must include both target outcomes and timeframes for achieving results:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of jobs anticipated to be created or saved as a direct result of the project.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The current baseline number of customers.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The estimated expansion of customer base as a direct result of the project.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The current baseline of revenue.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The estimated increase in revenue as a direct result of the project.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Applicants for both Working Capital and Planning Grants are invited to suggest additional benchmarks for evaluation that are specific to proposed project activities or outcomes and the corresponding timeframes for accomplishing them; these should be informed by the program objectives, stated above, related to new markets, expansion of customer base, and revenues returning to producer Applicants; as well as to the practical and/or logistical activities and tasks to be accomplished during the project period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proposal evaluation criteria.

Using the format prescribed by the application package, Applicants must certify that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cost-share Matching Funds will be spent in advance of grant funding, such that for every dollar of grant funds disbursed, not less than an equal amount of Matching Funds will have been expended prior to submitting the request for reimbursement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If Matching Funds are proposed in an amount exceeding the grant amount, those Matching Funds must be spent at a proportional rate equal to the match-to-grant ratio identified in the proposed budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verification of cost-share Matching Funds. Using the format prescribed by the application package, the Applicant must demonstrate and provide authentic documentation from the source to confirm the eligibility and availability of both cash and in-kind contributions that meet the definition requirements for Matching Funds and Conflict of Interest in Sec. 4284.902, as well as the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided at Sec. 4284.925(a) and (b), Matching Funds are subject to the same use restrictions as grant funds, and must be spent on eligible project expenses during the grant funding period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Matching Funds must be from eligible sources without a real or apparent Conflict of Interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Matching Funds must be at least equal to the amount of grant funds requested, and combined grant and Matching Funds must equal 100 percent of the Total Project Costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Unless provided by other authorizing legislation, other Federal grant funds cannot be used as Matching Funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Matching Funds must be provided in the form of confirmed Applicant cash, loan, or line of credit; or provided in the form of a confirmed Applicant or family member in-kind contribution that meets the requirements and limitations specified in Sec. 4284.925(a) and (b);
