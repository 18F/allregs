CCC will periodically publish  a Notice in the Federal Register that it is accepting applications for  participation in MAP. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with  the terms and requirements specified in the Notice and in these  regulations. Applicants are encouraged to submit a UES through the UES  Internet Web site, but are not required to do so. Applicants may apply  to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program  that provides MAP funds to brand participants for branded promotion. An  applicant who is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for  funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicant and program information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All applications shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, address, and Internet location of the home page of the  applicant organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name of the applicant's Chief Executive Officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The name, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the  applicant's primary contact person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The name(s) of the person(s) responsible for managing the  proposed program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A description of the applicant organization, including the type  of organization of the applicant (e.g., nonprofit SRTG), its mission,  and the statutory authorities by which it is constituted and under which  it operates, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Tax exempt identification number of the applicant, if  applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Beginning and ending dates for proposed program year (mm/dd/yy- mm/dd/yy);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Dollar amount of CCC resources requested for generic activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Dollar amount of CCC resources requested for brand activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Total dollar amount of CCC resources requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Percentage of CCC resources requested for general administrative  expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> A Dun and Bradstreet DUNS number for the applicant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> A description of the applicant organization's membership and  membership criteria;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> A list of organizations affiliated with the applicant, including  parent organizations, subsidiaries, and partnerships;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> A description of the applicant's management and administrative  capability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> A description of the applicant's prior export promotion  experience;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> Value, in U.S. dollars, of proposed contributions from the  applicant or the applicant's proposed contribution stated as a  percentage of the total dollar amount of CCC resources requested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(R)</em> Value, in U.S. dollars, of proposed contributions from other  sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Program justification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All applications shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s),  its harmonized tariff classification, the applicable commodity aggregate  code (available from the UES Web site) and the percentage of U.S. origin  content by weight, exclusive of added water;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the anticipated supply and demand situation for  the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The volume and value of exports of the promoted U.S.  agricultural commodity(s) to the targeted markets for the most recent 3- year period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the proposal is for 2 or more years, an explanation why the  proposal should be funded on a multi-year basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A certification and, if requested by CCC, a written explanation  supporting the certification that any funds received will supplement,  but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other  contributions to program activities.
