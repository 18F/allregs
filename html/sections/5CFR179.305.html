The request to review a disputed  debt must be received by the OPM official identified in the notification  within 30 calendar days of the debtor's receipt of the written notice  described in Sec. 179.304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the debtor requests an opportunity to inspect or copy OPM's  records concerning the disputed claim, 10 business days will be granted  for the review. The time period will be measured from the time the  request for inspection is granted or from the time the copy of the  records is received by the debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pending the resolution of a dispute initiated by the debtor,  transactions in any of the debtor's account(s) maintained in OPM may be  temporarily suspended to the extent of the debt that is owed. Depending  on the type of transaction, the suspension   could preclude payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the  payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the dispute be  resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be lifted  immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the review period, interest, penalties, and  administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act  of 1966, as amended, will continue to accrue.</p>
