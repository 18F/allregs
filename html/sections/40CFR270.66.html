                            <p class="depth0">When an owner or operator of a cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005 or when an owner or operator of an existing cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace demonstrates compliance with the air emission standards and limitations in part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter (i.e., by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting a Notification of Compliance under Sec. Sec.  63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter), the requirements of this section do not apply. The requirements of this section do apply, however, if the Director determines certain provisions are necessary to ensure compliance with Sec. Sec.  266.102(e)(1) and 266.102(e)(2)(iii) of this chapter if you elect to comply with Sec.  270.235(a)(1)(i) to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events; or if you are an area source and elect to comply with the Sec. Sec.  266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 standards and associated requirements for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, and non-mercury metals; or the Director determines certain provisions apply, on a case-by-case basis, for purposes of information collection in accordance with Sec. Sec.  270.10(k), 270.10(l), 270.32(b)(2), and 270.32(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Owners and operators of new boilers and industrial furnaces (those not operating under the interim status standards of Sec.  266.103 of this chapter) are subject to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. Boilers and industrial furnaces operating under the interim status standards of Sec.  266.103 of this chapter are subject to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permit operating periods for new boilers and industrial furnaces. A permit for a new boiler or industrial furnace shall specify appropriate conditions for the following operating periods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pretrial burn period. For the period beginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste and ending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to bring the boiler or industrial furnace to a point of operational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed 720 hours operating time when burning hazardous waste, the Director must establish in the Pretrial Burn Period of the permit conditions, including but not limited to, allowable hazardous waste feed rates and operating conditions. The Director may extend the duration of this operational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the applicant when good cause is shown. The permit may be modified to reflect the extension according to Sec.  270.42.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applicants must submit a statement, with part B of the permit application, that suggests the conditions

necessary to operate in compliance with the standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on the applicable operating requirements identified in Sec.  266.102(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Director will review this statement and any other relevant information submitted with part B of the permit application and specify requirements for this period sufficient to meet the performance standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter based on his/her engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trial burn period. For the duration of the trial burn, the Director must establish conditions in the permit for the purposes of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and determining adequate operating conditions under Sec.  266.102(e) of this chapter. Applicants must propose a trial burn plan, prepared under paragraph (c) of this section, to be submitted with part B of the permit application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Post-trial burn period. (i) For the period immediately following completion of the trial burn, and only for the minimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation, and submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and review of the trial burn results and modification of the facility permit by the Director to reflect the trial burn results, the Director will establish the operating requirements most likely to ensure compliance with the performance standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter based on his engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the period immediately following completion of the trial burn, and only for the minimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation, and submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and review of the trial burn results and modification of the facility permit by the Director to reflect the trial burn results, the Director will establish the operating requirements most likely to ensure compliance with the performance standards of Sec.

Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter based on his/her engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final permit period. For the final period of operation, the Director will develop operating requirements in conformance with Sec.  266.102(e) of this chapter that reflect conditions in the trial burn plan and are likely to ensure compliance with the performance standards of Sec. Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter. Based on the trial burn results, the Director shall make any necessary modifications to the operating requirements to ensure compliance with the performance standards. The permit modification shall proceed according to Sec.  270.42.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for trial burn plans. The trial burn plan must include the following information.

For the purpose of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of Sec.  266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and of

determining adequate operating conditions under Sec.  266.103 of this chapter, applicants owning or operating existing boilers or industrial furnaces operated under the interim status standards of Sec.  266.103 of this chapter must either prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn in accordance with the requirements of this section or submit other information as specified in Sec.  270.22(a)(6). The Director must announce his or her intention to approve of the trial burn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The contents of the notice must include: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the name and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the location where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the plan and the time periods during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants who submit a trial burn plan and receive approval before submission of the part B permit application must complete the trial burn and submit the results specified in paragraph (f) of this section with the part B permit application. If completion of this process conflicts with the date set for submission of the part B application, the applicant must contact the Director to establish a later date for submission of the part B application or the trial burn results. If the applicant submits a trial burn plan with part B of the permit application, the trial burn must be conducted and the results submitted within a time period prior to permit issuance to be specified by the Director.
