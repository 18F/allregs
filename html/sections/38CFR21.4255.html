                                Sec. 21.4255  Refund policy; nonaccredited courses.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptable refund policy. A refund policy meets the requirements  of Sec. 21.4254(c)(13), if it provides that the amount charged for  tuition, fees, and other charges for a portion of the course does not  exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges for  tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the completed  portion of the course bears to the total length. The school may make  provision for refund within the following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registration fee. An established registration fee in an amount  not to exceed $10 need not be subject to proration. Where the  established registration fee is more than $10, the amount in excess of  $10 will be subject to proration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Breakage fee. Where the school has a breakage fee, it may  provide for the retention of only the exact amount of the breakage, with  the remaining part, if any, to be refunded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consumable instructional supplies. Where the school makes a  separate charge for consumable instructional supplies, as distinguished  from laboratory fees, the exact amount of the charges for supplies  consumed may be retained but any remaining part must be refunded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Books, supplies and equipment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A veteran or eligible person  may retain or dispose of books, supplies and equipment at his or her  discretion when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> He or she purchased them from a bookstore or other source, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Their cost is separate and independent from the charge made by  the school for tuition and fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The school will make a refund in full for the amount of the  charge for unissued books, supplies and equipment when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The school furnishes the books, supplies and equipment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The school includes their cost in the total charge payable to  the school for the course.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The veteran or eligible person withdraws or is discontinued  before completing the course.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The veteran or eligible person may dispose of issued items at  his or her discretion even if they were included in the total charges  payable to the school for the course.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Tuition and other charges. Where the school either has or adopts  an established policy for the refund of the unused portion of tuition,  fees, and other charges subject to proration, which is more favorable to  the veteran or eligible person than the approximate pro rata basis as  provided in this paragraph, such established policy will be applicable.  Otherwise, the school may charge a sum which does not vary more than 10  percent from the exact pro rata portion of such tuition, fees, and other  charges that the length of the completed portion of the course bears to  its total length. The exact proration will be determined on the ratio of  the number of days of instruction completed by the student to the total  number of instructional days in the course.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prompt refund. In the event that the veteran, spouse, surviving  spouse or child fails to enter the course or withdraws or is  discontinued therefrom at any time prior to completion of the course,  the unused portion of the tuition, fees and other charges paid by the  individual shall be refunded promptly. Any institution which fails to  forward any refund due within 40 days after such a change in status,  shall be deemed, prima facie, to have failed to make a prompt refund, as  required by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An educational institution may apply through the  appropriate State approving agency to the Director of the VA facility of  jurisdiction for a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section as they apply to a veteran or eligible person. The State  approving agency shall forward the application to the Director along  with its recommendations. The Director shall consider the  recommendations and shall grant a waiver only when he or she finds that  the educational institution:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is a college, university, or similar institution offering post- secondary level academic instruction leading to an associate or higher  degree;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is operated by an agency of a State or a unit of local  government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If operated by an agency of a State, is located within that  State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If operated by a unit of local government, is located within  the boundaries of the area over which that unit has taxing jurisdiction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Is a candidate for accreditation by a regional accrediting  agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Charges the veteran or eligible person no more than $120 per  quarter, $180 per semester or $360 per school year in tuition, fees and  other charges for the course.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an educational institution disagrees with a decision of a  Director of a VA facility, it may ask that the Director, Education  Service review the decision. In reviewing the decision the Director must  consider the evidence of record. He or she may not grant a waiver unless  all the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3676(d))  [47 FR 42733, Sept. 29, 1982]</p>
