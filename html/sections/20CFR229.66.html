                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Change in DIB O/M. The amount of the worker's compensation or  public disability benefit reduction does not change when there is an  increase in the DIB O/M rate because of an amendment or cost of living  increase. However, the reduction amount does change if there is a change  in the family members included in the DIB O/M. When the number of family  members changes and the DIB O/M is still payable, the amount of the  reduction is recomputed using the DIB O/M rate, including the changed  family group, as if the new family composition had existed when the  worker's compensation or public disability benefit reduction first  applied. However, this new reduction is not effective until the date of  the change of the family group. The worker's compensation or public  disability benefit and average current earnings are the same as those  used before the change in the family group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change in amount of worker's compensation/public disability  benefit. The amount of the reduction for worker's compensation or public  disability benefit changes when there is a change in the amount of the  worker's compensation or public disability benefit. If the worker's  compensation or public disability benefit increases, the change in the  reduction amount is effective with the month of the increase. If the  worker's compensation or public disability benefit decreases, the change  in the reduction amount is effective with the month of the decrease, no  matter when the notice of the decrease is received.</p>
