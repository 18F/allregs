                            <p class="depth0">Affected source means the group of all equipment that comprise the  POTW treatment plant.</p><p class="depth0">Area source means any stationary source of HAP that is not a major  source.</p><p class="depth0">Cover means a device that prevents or reduces air pollutant  emissions to the atmosphere by forming a continuous barrier over the  waste material managed in a treatment unit. A cover may have openings  (such as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary  for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the treatment unit  on which the cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment  which can be detached and removed from the treatment unit, or a cover  may be formed by structural features permanently integrated into the  design of the treatment unit. The cover and its closure devices must be  made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the waste  material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain  the integrity of the cover and its closure devices throughout its  intended service life.</p><p class="depth0">Fraction emitted means the fraction of the mass of HAP entering the  POTW wastewater treatment plant which is emitted prior to secondary  treatment. The value is calculated using the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine mass emissions from all equipment up to, but not  including, secondary treatment for each HAP listed in Table 1 to subpart  DD of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sum the HAP emissions ([Sigma]E);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sum the HAP mass loadings ([Sigma]L) in the influent to the POTW  wastewater treatment plant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the fraction emitted (fe monthly) using  fe monthly = [Sigma]E/[Sigma]L.</p><p class="depth0">HAP means hazardous air pollutant(s).</p><p class="depth0">Industrial POTW means a POTW that accepts a waste stream regulated  by an industrial NESHAP and provides treatment and controls as an agent  for the industrial discharger. The industrial discharger complies with  its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at the POTW. For  example, an industry discharges its benzene-containing waste stream to  the POTW for treatment to comply with 40 CFR part 61, Subpart FF-- National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations. This definition  does not include POTW treating waste streams not specifically regulated  under another NESHAP.</p><p class="depth0">Industrial user means a nondomestic source introducing any pollutant  or combination of pollutants into a POTW. Industrial users can be  commercial or industrial facilities whose wastes enter local sewers.</p><p class="depth0">Non-industrial POTW means a POTW that does not meet the definition  of an industrial POTW as defined above.</p><p class="depth0">Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means a treatment works, as  that term is defined by section 112(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act, which is  owned by   a municipality (as defined by section 502(4) of the Clean Water Act), a  State, an intermunicipal or interstate agency, or any department,  agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government. This definition  includes any intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, sewage collection  systems, pumping, power, and other equipment. The wastewater treated by  these facilities is generated by industrial, commercial, and domestic  sources. As used in this regulation, the term POTW refers to both any  publicly owned treatment works which is owned by a State, municipality,  or intermunicipal or interstate agency and therefore eligible to receive  grant assistance under the Subchapter II of the Clean Water Act, and any  federally owned treatment works as that term is described in section  3023 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</p><p class="depth0">POTW treatment plant means that portion of the POTW which is  designed to provide treatment (including recycling and reclamation) of  municipal sewage and industrial waste.</p><p class="depth0">Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected or  a previously unaffected stationary source such that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent  of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a  comparable new source; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is technologically and economically feasible for the  reconstructed source to meet the relevant standard(s) established by the  Administrator (or a State) pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Upon  reconstruction, an affected source, or a stationary source that becomes  an affected source, is subject to relevant standards for new sources,  including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of  HAP from that source.</p><p class="depth0">Secondary treatment means treatment processes, typically biological,  designed to reduce the concentrations of dissolved and colloidal organic  matter in wastewater.</p><p class="depth0">Waste and wastewater means a material, or spent or used water or  waste, generated from residential, industrial, commercial, mining, or  agricultural operations or from community activities that contain  dissolved or suspended matter, and that is discarded, discharged, or is  being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or  biologically treated in a publicly owned treatment works.
