                                Sec. 123.400  What is the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loan Program?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loan Program allows SBA to make low  interest, fixed rate loans to small businesses for the purpose of  implementing mitigation measures to protect their commercial real  property (building) or leasehold improvements or contents from disaster  related damage. This program supports the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA's) Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program. This pilot program is  authorized for 5 fiscal years (October--September), from 2000 through  2004, and has only been approved for limited funding. Therefore,  approved loan requests are funded on a first come, first served basis up  to the limit of program funds available (see Sec. 123.411).</p>
