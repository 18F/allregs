The following terms shall have the specific meanings given  them:</p><p class="depth0">Annual coke production means the coke produced in the batteries  connected to the coke by-product recovery plant over a 12-month period.  The first 12-month period concludes on the first December 31 that comes  at least 12 months after the effective date or after the date of initial  startup if initial startup is after the effective date.</p><p class="depth0">Benzene storage tank means any tank, reservoir, or container used to  collect or store refined benzene.</p><p class="depth0">BTX storage tank means any tank, reservoir, or container used to  collect or store benzene-toluene-xylene or other light-oil fractions.</p><p class="depth0">Car seal means a seal that is placed on the device used to change  the position of a valve (e.g., from open to closed) such that the  position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal and  requiring the replacement of the old seal, once broken, with a new seal.</p><p class="depth0">Coke by-product recovery plant means any plant designed and operated  for the separation and recovery of coal tar derivatives (by-products)  evolved from coal during the coking process of a coke oven battery.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each pump, valve, exhauster, pressure relief device,  sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, and flange or  other connector in benzene service.</p><p class="depth0">Excess ammonia-liquor storage tank means any tank, reservoir, or  container used to collect or store a flushing liquor solution prior to  ammonia or phenol recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Exhauster means a fan located between the inlet gas flange and  outlet gas flange of the coke oven gas line   that provides motive power for coke oven gases.</p><p class="depth0">Foundry coke means coke that is produced from raw materials with  less than 26 percent volatile material by weight and that is subject to  a coking period of 24 hours or more. Percent volatile material of the  raw materials (by weight) is the weighted average percent volatile  material of all raw materials (by weight) charged to the coke oven per  coking cycle.</p><p class="depth0">Foundry coke by-product recovery plant means a coke by-product  recovery plant connected to coke batteries whose annual coke production  is at least 75 percent foundry coke.</p><p class="depth0">Flushing-liquor circulation tank means any vessel that functions to  store or contain flushing liquor that is separated from the tar in the  tar decanter and is recirculated as the cooled liquor to the gas  collection system.</p><p class="depth0">Furnace coke means coke produced in by-product ovens that is not  foundry coke.</p><p class="depth0">Furnace coke by-product recovery plant means a coke by-product  recovery plant that is not a foundry coke by-product recovery plant.</p><p class="depth0">In benzene service means a piece of equipment, other than an  exhauster, that either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that  is at least 10 percent benzene by weight or any exhauster that either  contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) at least 1 percent benzene  by weight as determined by the provisions of Sec. 61.137(b). The  provisions of Sec. 61.137(b) also specify how to determine that a piece  of equipment is not in benzene service.</p><p class="depth0">Light-oil condenser means any unit in the light-oil recovery  operation that functions to condense benzene-containing vapors.</p><p class="depth0">Light-oil decanter means any vessel, tank, or other type of device  in the light-oil recovery operation that functions to separate light oil  from water downstream of the light-oil condenser. A light-oil decanter  also may be known as a light-oil separator.</p><p class="depth0">Light-oil storage tank means any tank, reservoir, or container used  to collect or store crude or refined light-oil.</p><p class="depth0">Light-oil sump means any tank, pit, enclosure, or slop tank in  light-oil recovery operations that functions as a wastewater separation  device for hydrocarbon liquids on the surface of the water.</p><p class="depth0">Naphthalene processing means any operations required to recover  naphthalene including the separation, refining, and drying of crude or  refined naphthalene.</p><p class="depth0">Non-regenerative carbon adsorber means a series, over time, of non- regenerative carbon beds applied to a single source or group of sources,  where non-regenerative carbon beds are carbon beds that are either never  regenerated or are moved from their location for regeneration.</p><p class="depth0">Process vessel means each tar decanter, flushing-liquor circulation  tank, light-oil condenser, light-oil decanter, wash-oil decanter, or  wash-oil circulation tank.</p><p class="depth0">Regenerative carbon adsorber means a carbon adsorber applied to a  single source or group of sources, in which the carbon beds are  regenerated without being moved from their location.</p><p class="depth0">Semiannual means a 6-month period; the first semiannual period  concludes on the last day of the last full month during the 180 days  following initial startup for new sources; the first semiannual period  concludes on the last day of the last full month during the 180 days  after the effective date of the regulation for existing sources.</p><p class="depth0">Tar decanter means any vessel, tank, or container that functions to  separate heavy tar and sludge from flushing liquor by means of gravity,  heat, or chemical emulsion breakers. A tar decanter also may be known as  a flushing-liquor decanter.</p><p class="depth0">Tar storage tank means any vessel, tank, reservoir, or other type of  container used to collect or store crude tar or tar-entrained  naphthalene, except for tar products obtained by distillation, such as  coal tar pitch, creosotes, or carbolic oil. This definition also  includes any vessel, tank, reservoir, or container used to reduce the  water content of the tar by means of heat, residence time, chemical  emulsion breakers, or centrifugal separation. A tar storage tank also  may be known as a tar-dewatering tank.</p><p class="depth0">Tar-intercepting sump means any tank, pit, or enclosure that serves  to receive or separate tars and aqueous   condensate discharged from the primary cooler. A tar-intercepting sump  also may be known as a primary-cooler decanter.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used  for destroying organic compounds and does not necessarily extract energy  in the form of steam or process heat.</p><p class="depth0">Wash-oil circulation tank means any vessel that functions to hold  the wash oil used in light-oil recovery operations or the wash oil used  in the wash-oil final cooler.</p><p class="depth0">Wash-oil decanter means any vessel that functions to separate, by  gravity, the condensed water from the wash oil received from a wash-oil  final cooler or from a light-oil scrubber.
