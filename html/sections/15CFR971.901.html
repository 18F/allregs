                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All hearings described in Sec. 971.900 are  governed by subpart C of 15 CFR part 904, as modified by this section.  The rules in this subpart take precedence over 15 CFR part 904, subpart  C, to the extent there is a conflict.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hearings held under this section will be consolidated insofar as  practicable with hearings held by other agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of this subpart, involved applicant, licensee  or permittee means an applicant, licensee or permittee the status of  whose application, license, permit or activities conducted under the  license or permit may be altered by the Administrator as a result of  proceedings under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision to hold a hearing. Whenever the Administrator finds  that a formal hearing is required by the provisions of this part or 15  CFR part 970, he will provide for a formal hearing. Upon deciding to  hold a formal hearing, the Administrator will refer the proceeding to  the Department of Commerce Office of Administrative Law Judges for  assignment to an Administrative Law Judge to serve as presiding officer  for the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of formal hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator will publish  notice of the formal hearing in the Federal Register at least 15 days  before the beginning of the hearing, and will send written notice by  registered or certified mail to any involved applicant, licensee or  permittee and to all persons who submitted written comments upon the  action in question, or who testified at any prior informal hearing on  the action or who filed a request for the formal hearing under this part  or 15 CFR part 970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of a formal hearing will include, among other things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Time and place of the hearing and the name of the presiding  judge, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the person(s) requesting the formal  hearing or a statement that the formal hearing is being held by order of  the Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The issues in dispute which are to be resolved in the formal  hearing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The due date for filing a written request to participate in the  hearing in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reference to any prior informal hearing from which the issues to  be determined arose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Powers and duties of the administrative law judge. In addition  to the powers enumerated in 15 CFR part 904. Subpart C, judges will have  the power to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the  parties, interested persons and others submitting evidence, including  but not limited to the power to require the submission of part or all of  the evidence in written form if the judge determines a party will not be  prejudiced thereby, and if otherwise in accordance with law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  of this section to participate as a party, or requests submitted in  accordance with   paragraph (f)(3) of this section to participate as an interested person  in a proceeding, by allowing, denying, or limiting such participation;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require at or prior to any hearing, the submission and exchange  of evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Argument. At the close of the formal hearing, each party will be  given the opportunity to submit written arguments on the issues before  the judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Hearing participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parties to the formal hearing will  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The NOAA General Counsel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any involved applicant, licensee or permittee; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other person determined by the judge, in accordance with  paragraph (f)(2) below, to be eligible to participate as a full party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person desiring to participate as a party in a formal  hearing must submit a request to the judge to be admitted as a party.  The request must be submitted within ten days after the date of mailing  or publication of notice of a decision to hold a formal hearing,  whichever occurs later. Such person will be allowed to participate if  the judge finds that the interests of justice and a fair determination  of the issues would be served by granting the request. The judge may  entertain a request submitted after the expiration of the ten days, but  such a request may only be granted upon an express finding on the record  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Special circumstances justify granting the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The interests of justice and a fair determination of the issues  would be served by granting the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The requestor has consented to be bound by all prior written  agreements and stipulations agreed to by the existing parties, and all  prior orders entered in the proceedings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Granting the request will not cause undue delay or prejudice  the rights of the existing parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any interested person who desires to submit evidence in a  formal hearing must submit a request within ten days after the dates of  mailing or publication of notice of a decision to hold a formal hearing,  whichever occurs later. The judge may waive the ten day rule for good  cause, such as if the interested person, making this request after the  expiration of the ten days, the formal hearing, and the evidence he  proposes to submit may significantly affect the outcome of the  proceedings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The judge may permit an interested person to submit evidence at  any formal hearing if the judge determines that such evidence is  relevant to facts in dispute concerning the issue(s) being adjudicated.  The fact that an interested person may submit evidence under this  paragraph at a hearing does not entitle the interested person to  participate in other ways in the hearing unless allowed by the judge  under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The judge may allow an interested person to submit oral  testimony, oral arguments or briefs, or to cross-examine witnesses or  participate in other ways, if the judge determines:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That the interests of justice would be better served by allowing  such participation by the interested person; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That there are compelling circumstances favoring such  participation by the interested person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definition of issues. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a formal hearing is conducted  pursuant to this section the Administrator may certify the issues for  decision to the judge, and if the issues are so certified, the formal  hearing will be limited to those issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever a formal hearing is conducted pursuant to a request by  an applicant, licensee or permittee for review of a denial of  certification, issuance or transfer of a license or permit in accordance  with section 106(a)(4) of the Act, or pursuant to an objection to any  term, condition, or restriction in a permit in accordance with section  105(b)(3) or (c)(4) of the Act, no issues may be raised by any party or  interested person that were not previously raised in the administrative  proceedings on the action pursuant to any such section, unless the judge  determines that good cause is shown for the failure to raise them. Good  cause includes the case where the party seeking to raise the new issues  shows that it could not reasonably have ascertained the issues at a  prior stage in the administrative process, or that   it could not have reasonably anticipated the relevance or materiality of  the information sought to be introduced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decisions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The judge will allow each party to file with the judge proposed findings  of fact, and in appropriate cases conclusions of law, together with a  supporting brief expressing the reasons for such proposals. Such  proposals and briefs must be filed within ten days after the hearing or  within such additional time as the judge may allow. Such proposals and  briefs must refer to all portions of the record and to all authorities  relied upon in support of each proposal. Reply briefs must be submitted  within ten days after receipt of the proposed findings and conclusions  to which they respond, unless the judge allows additional time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recommended decision. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As soon as practicable, but normally  not later than 90 days after the conclusion of the formal hearing, the  judge will evaluate the record of the formal hearing and prepare and  file a recommended decision with the Administrator. The decision will  contain findings of fact, when appropriate, conclusions regarding all  material isuses of law, and a recommendation as to the appropriate  action to be taken by the Administrator. The judge will serve a copy of  the decision on each party and upon the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within thirty days after the date the recommended decision is  served, any party may file with the Administrator exceptions to the  recommended decision. The exceptions must refer to all portions of the  record and to all authorities relied on in support of the exceptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Final decision. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As soon as practicable, but normally not  later than 60 days after receipt of the recommended decision, the  Administrator will issue a final decision. The final decision will  include findings of fact and conclusions regarding material issues of  law or discretion, as well as reasons therefor. The final decision may  accept or reject all or part of the recommended decision. The  Administrator shall assure that the record shows the ruling on each  exception presented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to hearings held pursuant to section 116(b), the  Administrator may defer announcement of his findings of fact until the  time he takes final action with respect to any action described in  section 116(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator will base the final decision upon the record  already made except that the Administrator may issue orders:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Specifying the filing of supplemental briefs; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Remanding the matter to the judge for the receipt of further  evidence, or otherwise assisting in the determination of the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Filing and service of documents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the regulations in  this subpart or an order issued hereunder require a document to be filed  within a certain period of time, such document will be considered filed  as of the date of the postmark, if mailed, or (if not mailed) as of the  date actually delivered to the office where filing is required.
