                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before stowing charcoal Division 4.2 (flammable solid), UN 1361,  NA 1361, or UN 1362 on a vessel for transportation, the hold or  compartment in which it is to be stowed must be swept as clean as  practicable. All residue of any former cargo, including especially a  petroleum product, a vegetable or animal oil, nitrate, or sulfur, must  be removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charcoal packed in bags and offered for transportation on board  a vessel in a quantity over 1016 kg (2240 pounds) must be loaded so that  the bags are laid horizontally and stacked with space for efficient air  circulation. If the bags are not compactly filled and closed to avoid  free space within, vertical and horizontal dunnage strips must be laid  between the bags. Space for ventilating must be maintained near  bulkheads, the shell of the vessel, the deck, and the overhead. No more  than 40,600 kg (89,508 pounds) of charcoal may be stowed in a hold or  compartment when other stowage space is available. If the unavailability  of hold or compartment space requires the stowage of a larger amount,  the arrangement of the stow for ventilation must be adjusted to ensure a  sufficient venting effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any loose material from bags broken during loading must be  removed. Broken bags may be repacked or have the closures repaired and  the repaired bags restowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Charcoal ``screenings'' packed in bags must be stowed to provide  spaces for air circulation between tiers regardless of the quantity  stowed.</p>
