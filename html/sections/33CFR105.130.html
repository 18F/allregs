The Commandant (CG-5P) may require the facility owner or operator to provide data for use in determining the validity of the requested waiver. The Commandant (CG-5P) may grant, in writing, a waiver with or without conditions only if the waiver will not reduce the overall security of the facility, its employees, visiting vessels, or ports.
