Such application shall contain the information required in Sec. 85.1504(a)(1) (i) through (v) and shall contain both an attestation by a qualified mechanic that the catalyst has been replaced and the O2 sensor has been replaced, if necessary, and that both parts are functioning properly, and a copy of the invoice for parts and labor.
