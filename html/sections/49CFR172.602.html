                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information required. For purposes of this subpart, the term ``emergency response information'' means information that can be used in the mitigation of an incident involving hazardous materials and, as a minimum, must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basic description and technical name of the hazardous material as required by Secs. 172.202 and 172.203(k), the ICAO Technical Instructions, the IMDG Code, or the TDG Regulations, as appropriate (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediate hazards to health;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Risks of fire or explosion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Immediate precautions to be taken in the event of an accident or incident;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Immediate methods for handling fires;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Initial methods for handling spills or leaks in the absence of fire; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Preliminary first aid measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of information. The information required for a hazardous material by paragraph (a) of this section must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Printed legibly in English;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Available for use away from the package containing the hazardous material; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presented--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On a shipping paper;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a document, other than a shipping paper, that includes both the basic description and technical name of the hazardous material as required by Secs. 172.202 and 172.203(k), the ICAO Technical Instructions, the IMDG Code, or the TDG Regulations, as appropriate, and the emergency response information required by this subpart (e.g., a material safety data sheet); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Related to the information on a shipping paper, a written notification to pilot-in-command, or a dangerous cargo manifest, in a separate document

(e.g., an emergency response guidance document), in a manner that cross-references the description of the hazardous material on the shipping paper with the emergency response information contained in the document. Aboard aircraft, the ICAO ``Emergency Response Guidance for Aircraft Incidents Involving Dangerous Goods'' and, aboard vessels, the IMO ``Emergency Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods'', or equivalent documents, may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section for a separate document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintenance of information. Emergency response information shall be maintained as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carriers. Each carrier who transports a hazardous material shall maintain the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 172.606 of this part in the same manner as prescribed for shipping papers, except that the information must be maintained in the same manner aboard aircraft as the notification of pilot-in-command, and aboard vessels in the same manner as the dangerous cargo manifest. This information must be immediately accessible to train crew personnel, drivers of motor vehicles, flight crew members, and bridge personnel on vessels for use in the event of incidents involving hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facility operators. Each operator of a facility where a hazardous material is received, stored or handled during transportation, shall maintain the information required by paragraph (a) of this section whenever the hazardous material is present. This information must be in a location that is immediately accessible to facility personnel in the event of an incident involving the hazardous material.
