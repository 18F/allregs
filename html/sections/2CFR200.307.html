                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Non-Federal entities are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Federal award or Federal awarding agency regulations as program income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies are not program income; such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Subpart D--Post Federal Award Requirements of this part, Property Standards Secs. 200.311 Real property, 200.313 Equipment, and 200.314 Supplies, or as specifically identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of program income. If the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, or give prior approval for how program income

is to be used, paragraph (e)(1) of this section must apply. For Federal awards made to IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, if the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(2) of this section must apply. In specifying alternatives to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, the Federal awarding agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When the Federal awarding agency authorizes the approaches in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any amounts specified must also be deducted from expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deduction. Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income must be used for current costs unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Addition. With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency (except for IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, as described in paragraph (e) of this section) program income may be added to the Federal award by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. The program income must be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost sharing or matching. With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the Federal award. The amount of the Federal award remains the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Income after the period of performance. There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of income earned after the end of the period of performance for the Federal award, unless the Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award provide otherwise. The Federal awarding agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the period of performance as part of the grant closeout process. See also Sec. 200.343 Closeout.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unless the Federal statute, regulations, or terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, the non-Federal entity has no obligation to the Federal awarding agency with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award to which 37 CFR part 401,``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Awards, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements'' is applicable.
