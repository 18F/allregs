                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The dynamometer shall be calibrated at least once each month or performance verified at least once each week and then calibrated as required. The dynamometer is driven above the test speed range. The device used to drive the dynamometer is then disengaged from the dynamometer and the roll is allowed to coast down. The kinetic energy of the system is dissipated by the dynamometer. This method neglects the variations in roll bearing friction due to the drive axle weight of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calibration shall consist of coasting down the dynamometer for each inertia load combination used. Coastdown times for the interval from 70 to 60 km/h shall be within the tolerances specified in Sec. 86.529. The dynamometer adjustments necessary to produce these results shall be noted for future reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The performance check consists of conducting a dynamometer coastdown at one or more inertia-horsepower settings and comparing the coastdown time to the table in Figure F98-9 of Sec. 86.529-98. If the coastdown time is outside the tolerance, a new calibration is required.
