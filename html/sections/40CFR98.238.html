The distinction between high permeability gas and tight gas reservoirs shall be designated as follows: High permeability gas reservoirs with 0.1 millidarcy permeability, and tight gas reservoirs with <=0.1 millidarcy permeability. Permeability for a reservoir type shall be determined by engineering estimate. Wells that produce only from high permeability gas, shale gas, coal seam, or other tight gas reservoir rock are considered gas wells; gas wells producing from more than one of these formation types shall be classified into only one type based on the formation with the most contribution to production as determined by engineering knowledge.
