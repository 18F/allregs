                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Letter is a message directed to a specific person or address and  recorded in or on a tangible object, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tangible objects used for letters include, but are not limited  to, paper (including paper in sheet or card form), recording disks, and  magnetic tapes. Tangible objects used for letters do not include (i)  objects the material or shape and design of which make them valuable or  useful for purposes other than as media for long-distance  communications, unless they are actually used as media for personal and  business correspondence, and (ii) outsized, rigid objects not capable of  enclosure in envelopes, sacks, boxes or other containers commonly used  to transmit letters or packets of letters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Message means any information or intelligence that can be  recorded as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A message is directed to a ``specific person or address'' when,  for example, it, or the container in which it is carried, singly or with  other messages, identical or different, is marked for delivery to a  specific person or place, or is delivered to a specific person or place  in accordance with a selective delivery plan. Selective delivery plans  include delivery to particular persons or addresses by use of detached  address labels or cards; address lists; memorized groups of addresses;  or ``piggy-backed'' delivery with addressed articles of merchandise,  publications, or other items. Selective delivery plans do not include  distributions of materials without written addresses to passersby on a  particular street corner, or to all residents or randomly selected  residents of an area. A message bearing the name or address of a  specific person or place is a letter even if it is intended by the  sender to be read or otherwise used by some person or persons other than  or in addition to the addressee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Methods by which messages are recorded on tangible objects  include, but are not limited to, the use of written or printed  characters, drawing, holes, or orientations of magnetic particles in a  manner having a predetermined significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether a tangible object bears a message is to be determined on  an objective basis without regard to the intended or actual use made of  the object sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Identical messages directed to more than one specific person or  address or separately directed to the same person or address constitute  separate letters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The following are not letters within the meaning of these  regulations: \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Several of the items enumerated in this paragraph (a)(7) do not  self-evidently lie outside of the definition of ``letter''. To the  extent, however, that there is any question whether these items may  properly be excluded by definition, the Postal Service has determined by  adoption of these regulations that the restrictions of the Private  Express Statutes are suspended pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 601(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Telegrams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Checks, drafts, promissory notes, bonds, other negotiable and  nonnegotiable financial instruments, stock certificates, other  securities, insurance policies, and title policies when shipped to,  from, or between financial institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> As used above, checks and drafts include documents intrinsically  related to and regularly accompanying the   movement of checks or drafts within the banking system. ``Checks'' do  not include materials accompanying the movement of checks to financial  institutions from persons who are not financial institutions, or vice  versa, except such materials as would qualify under Sec. 310.3(a) if  ``checks'' were treated as cargo. Specifically, for example, ``checks''  do not include bank statements sent to depositors showing deposits,  debits, and account balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As used above, financial institutions means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As to checks and drafts: banks, savings banks, savings and loan  institutions, credit unions, and their offices, affiliates, and  facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As to other instruments: institutions performing functions  involving the bulk generation, clearance, and transfer of such  instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Abstracts of title, mortgages and other liens, deeds, leases,  releases, articles of incorporation, papers filed in lawsuits or formal  quasi-judicial proceedings, and orders of courts and of quasi-judicial  bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Newspapers and periodicals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Books and catalogs consisting of 24 or more bound pages with at  least 22 printed, and telephone directories. Separate letters of less  than 24 bound and 22 printed pages bound to other material do not  qualify for this exclusion. In determining whether separate letters have  been bound to other material, the following factors will be considered,  along with any other relevant factors: Whether the parts are visually  similar; whether the parts were printed and bound together at the same  time and by the same process; whether the binding serves an important  purpose and has been a longstanding practice; and whether the same  individual reads all parts of the bound document. Ordinarily, books and  catalogs deal with matters of interest to, and are intended for, a  substantial number of recipients. In addition, books generally contain a  substantial number of pages. Accordingly, this exclusion will not apply  when the nature of the message conveyed, the limited numbers of  published copies and of recipients, the limited number of pages, or  other relevant factors suggest that it is not appropriate to treat the  material as a book or catalog. An item distributed privately, or  privately and by mail, to fewer than 25 separate persons or places will  generally not be treated as a book or catalog falling within this  exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Matter sent from a printer, stationer, or similar source, to a  person ordering such matter for use as his letters. This exclusion  applies whether or not the printer, stationer, or similar source is  owned by or affiliated with the person who orders such matter for use as  his letters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Letters sent to a records storage center exclusively for  storage, letters sent exclusively for destruction, letters retrieved  from a records storage center, and letters sent as part of a household  or business relocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Tags, labels, stickers, signs or posters the type-size,  layout or physical characteristics of which indicate they are primarily  intended to be attached to other objects for reading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Photographic material being sent by a person to a processor and  processed photographic material being returned from the processor to the  person sending the material for processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Copy sent from a person to an independent or company-owned  printer or compositor, or between printers and compositors, and proofs  or printed matter returned from the printer or compositor to the office  of the person who initially sent the copy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Sound recordings, films, and packets of identical printed  letters containing messages all or the overwhelming bulk of which are to  be disseminated to the public. The ``public'' does not include  individuals residing at the place of address; individuals employed by  the organization doing business at the place of address (whether or not  the actual place of employment is the place of address); individuals who  are members of an organization, if an organization is located at the  place of address; or other individuals who, individually or as members  of a group, are reasonably identifiable to the sender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Computer programs recorded on media suitable for direct input.  For the conditions under which the Private Express Statutes are  suspended for data processing materials, see Sec. 320.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Packet means two or more letters, identical or different, or two  or more packets of letters, under one cover or otherwise bound together.  As used in these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires,  ``letter'' or ``letters'' includes ``packet'' or ``packets''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Person means an individual, corporation, association,  partnership, governmental agency, or other organization or entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Post routes are routes on which mail is carried by the Postal  Service, and includes post roads as defined in 39 U.S.C. 5003, as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The waters of the United States, during the time the mail is  carried thereon;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Railroads or parts of railroads and air routes in operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Canals, during the time the mail is carried thereon;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public roads, highways, and toll roads during the time the mail  is carried thereon; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Letter-carrier routes established for the collection and  delivery of mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Private carriage, private carrier, and terms of similar import  used in connection with the Private Express Statutes or these  regulations mean carriage by anyone other than the Postal Service,  regardless of any meaning ascribed to similar terms under other bodies  of law or regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Private Express Statutes are set forth in 18 U.S.C. 1693- 1699 and 39 U.S.C. 601-606 (1970).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The term identical printed letters includes letters that differ  only in name, address or serial number.  [39 FR 33211, Sept. 16, 1974, as amended at 44 FR 52833, Sept. 11, 1979;  45 FR 3034, Jan. 16, 1980; 45 FR 59873, Sept. 11, 1980; 48 FR 42354,  Sept. 27, 1982]</p>
