                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Service of process generally. An employee, at a field facility,  served with a writ of habeas corpus involving a beneficiary of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in the employee's custody will  immediately notify the Regional Counsel of the region in addition to  taking such steps as in his or her judgment are necessary for self  protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Habeas corpus writs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a Director of a Department of  Veterans Affairs hospital concerned advises that, according, to current  medical opinion, hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety  or the safety of others, the Regional Counsel will vigorously oppose the  writ at the trial court level. If the writ is granted, no further action  will be taken unless so instructed by the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the medical opinion is that hospitalization is not required  for the veteran's safety or the safety of others but continued treatment  is clearly indicated in the veteran's interest, the Regional Counsel  will assure that the court issuing the writ is so informed and will  abide by the court's decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the medical opinion is that there is no danger of self injury  to the veteran or others and the need for continued treatment is not  clearly demonstrated, the Regional Counsel will advise the Director of  the hospital concerned that the veteran should be released and will  notify the veteran's attorney of the planned discharge. These cases will  be handled informally to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Involuntary confinement of mentally ill patients in Department  of Veterans Affairs installations is predicated upon the law of the  State in which the installation is located. In the event the writ is  filed in Federal Court, the Regional Counsel will cooperate with the  U.S. Attorney to the end that the case is removed to the appropriate  State court.
