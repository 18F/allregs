                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons or site activities are exempt from  this part if the means by which they manufacture a chemical substance  solely involves mining or other solely extractive functions, e.g., those  companies or sites within a company whose sole function is to mine  mineral ores, extract petroleum or natural gas, quarry non-metallic  minerals (including extraction of salts from seawater or brines), mine  or otherwise extract coal, or separate gases from the atmosphere. This  exemption may include, but is not necessarily limited to, firms engaged  in activities as described in SIC Division B--Mining and SIC Code 2813-- Industrial Gases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person is not subject to this part if the chemical substances  that person causes to be produced are limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that  occur incidental to exposure of another chemical substance, mixture, or  article to environmental factors such as air, moisture, microbial  organisms, or sunlight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that  occur incidental to storage or disposal of other chemical substances,  mixtures, or articles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that  occur upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles  such as adhesives, paints, miscellaneous cleaners or other housekeeping  products, fuel additives, water softening and treatment agents,  photographic films, batteries, matches, or safety flares, and that are  not themselves manufactured or imported for distribution in commerce for  use as chemical intermediates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that  occur upon use of curable plastic or rubber molding compounds, inks,  drying oils, metal finishing compounds, adhesives, or paints, or other  chemical substance formed during the manufacture of an article destined  for the marketplace without further chemical change of the chemical  substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that  occur when (A) a stabilizer, colorant, odorant, antioxidant, filler,  solvent, carrier, surfactant, plasticizer, corrosion inhibitor,  antifoamer or defoamer, dispersant, precipitation-inhibitor, binder,  emulsifier, deemulsifier, dewatering agent, agglomerating agent,  adhesion promoter, flow modifier, pH adjuster, sequestrant, coagulant,  flocculant, fire retardant, lubricant, chelating agent, or quality  control reagent functions as intended, or (B) a chemical substance,  which is intended solely to impart a specific physicochemical  characteristic, functions as intended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sole distributors. A person solely engaged in the distribution  of chemical substances is exempt from this part, unless such person is  also a manufacturer or processor subject to this part. For example, a  ``distributor'' who repackages chemical substances or mixtures is  considered to be a processor and, thus, is not a sole distributor. Sole  distributors may include, but are not limited to, those firms that  distribute chemical substances as described in the wholesale trade SIC  codes 5161--Chemicals and Allied Products, 5171--Petroleum Bulk Stations  and Terminals, and 5172--Petroleum and Petroleum Products Wholesalers,  Except Bulk Stations and Terminals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retailers. A person who is a retailer is exempt from this part  unless such person is also a manufacturer or a processor subject to this  part.
