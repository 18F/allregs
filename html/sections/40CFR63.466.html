This measurement can also be taken at the exit of the  solvent cleaning machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As an alternative to complying with paragraph (a)(4) of this  section, the owner or operator can provide data, sufficient to satisfy  the Administrator, that demonstrate that the part temperature remains  above the boiling point of the solvent at all times that the part is  within the continuous web solvent cleaning machine. This data could  include design and operating conditions such as information supporting  any exothermic reaction inherent in the processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a cover (working-mode, downtime-mode, and/or idling-mode  cover) is used to comply with these standards, the owner or operator  shall conduct a visual inspection to determine if the cover is opening  and closing properly, completely covers the cleaning machine openings  when closed, and is free of cracks, holes, and other defects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a dwell is used, the owner or operator shall determine the  actual dwell time by measuring the period of time that parts are held  within the freeboard area of the solvent cleaning machine after  cleaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(4)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall determine the hoist speed by  measuring the time it takes for the hoist to travel a measured distance.  The speed is equal to the distance in meters divided by the time in  minutes (meters per minute).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monitoring shall be conducted monthly. If after the first  year, no exceedances of the hoist speed are measured, the owner or  operator may begin monitoring the hoist speed quarterly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an exceedance of the hoist speed occurs during quarterly  monitoring, the monitoring frequency returns to monthly until another  year of compliance without an exceedance is demonstrated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's  satisfaction in the initial compliance report that the hoist cannot  exceed a speed of 3.4 meters per minute (11 feet per minute), the  required monitoring frequency is quarterly, including during the first  year of compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(D)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine the direction of the wind current by slowly rotating a  velometer or similar device until the maximum speed is located.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Orient a velometer in the direction of the wind current at each  of the four corners of the machine.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Record the reading for each corner.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Average the values obtained at each corner and record the  average wind speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitor on a weekly basis the room parameters established  during the initial compliance test that are used to achieve the reduced  room draft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section and a monthly visual inspection of the  enclosure to determine if it is free of cracks, holes and other defects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the direction of the wind current in the enclosure by  slowly rotating a velometer inside the entrance to the enclosure until  the maximum speed is located.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Record the maximum wind speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use a colorimetric detector tube designed to measure a  concentration of 100 parts per million by volume of solvent in air to an  accuracy of [25 parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the colorimetric detector tube according to the  manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a sampling port for monitoring within the exhaust outlet  of the carbon adsorber that is easily accessible and located at least 8  stack or duct diameters downstream from any flow disturbance such as a  bend, expansion, contraction, or outlet; downstream from no other inlet;  and 2 stack or duct diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as  a bend, expansion, contraction, inlet or outlet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If using controls listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this  section, the owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring  frequency requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If using controls not listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of  this section, the owner or operator shall establish the monitoring  frequency for each control and submit it to the Administrator for  approval in the initial test report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each owner or operator using a control device listed in  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section can use alternative  monitoring procedures approved by the Administrator.
