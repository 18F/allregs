                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers shall calculate initial test results using the applicable test procedure specified in Sec. 94.506(a). These results must also include the Green Engine Factor, if applicable. Round these results to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To calculate test results, sum the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, divide by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional decimal place. (For example, if the applicable standard is 7.8, then round the test results to two places to the right of the decimal.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To calculate the final test results for each test engine, apply the appropriate deterioration factors, derived in the certification process for the engine family, to the test results described in paragraph (b) of this section; round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional decimal place. (For example, if the applicable standard is 7.8, then round the test results to two places to the right of the decimal.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> If, subsequent to an initial failure of a Category 1 or Category 2 production line test, the average of the test results for the failed engine and the two additional engines tested, is greater than any applicable emission standard or FEL, the engine family is deemed to be in non-compliance with applicable emission standards, and the manufacturer must notify the Administrator within 2 working days of such noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, subsequent to an initial failure of a Category 1 or Category 2 production line test, the average of the test results for the failed engine and the two additional engines tested, is greater than any applicable emission standard or FEL, the engine family is deemed to be in non-compliance with applicable emission standards, and the manufacturer must notify the Administrator within 2 working days of such noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within 30 calendar days of the end of each quarter in which production line testing occurs, each manufacturer

must submit to the Administrator a report which includes the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of the manufacturer's emission test facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported pursuant to this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total production and sample size for each engine family;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicable standards and/or FELs against which each engine family was tested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the test engines;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each test conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the test engine, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration and engine family identification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make, and build date;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engine identification number;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Number of hours of service accumulated on engine prior to testing; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Description of Green Engine Factor; how it is determined and how it is applied;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Location(s) where service accumulation was conducted and description of accumulation procedure and schedule, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Test number, date, test procedure used, initial test results before and after rounding, and final test results for all production line emission tests conducted, whether valid or invalid, and the reason for invalidation of any test results, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A complete description of any adjustment, modification, repair, preparation, maintenance, and testing which was performed on the test engine, has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of this subpart, and will not be performed on other production engines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other information the Administrator may request relevant to the determination whether the new engines being manufactured by the manufacturer do in fact conform with the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For each failed engine as defined in Sec. 94.510(a), a description of the remedy and test results for all retests as required by Sec. 94.512(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The date of the end of the engine manufacturer's model year production for each engine family tested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The following signed statement and endorsement by an authorized representative of the manufacturer:</p><p class="depth3">This report is submitted pursuant to Sections 213 and 208 of the Clean Air Act. This production line testing program was conducted in complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part 94. No emission-related changes to production processes or quality control procedures for the engine family tested have been made during this production line testing program that affect engines from the production line.
