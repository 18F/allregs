In cases warranting denial, TJAG promptly sends a recommendation and supporting documentation, through SAF/GC and SAF/MI, to USD/P&R; for decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fact that a recommendation for denial is pending does not by itself authorize noncompliance or a delay in compliance with any provision of this section, but TJAG may consider a pending request for denial in determining whether to grant a delay.</p>
