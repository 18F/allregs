If the application of a single index to different classes of services would be substantially inequitable because of differences in the mix of goods and services comprising practice expenses for the different classes of services, more than one index may be established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjusting the practice expense index to account for the Frontier State floor--(1) General criteria.
