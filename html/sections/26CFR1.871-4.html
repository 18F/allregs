                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rules of evidence. The following rules of evidence shall govern  in determining whether or not an alien within the United States has  acquired residence therein for purposes of the income tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonresidence presumed. An alien by reason of his alienage, is  presumed to be a nonresident alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presumption rebutted--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Departing alien. In the case of an  alien who presents himself for determination of tax liability before  departure from the United States, the presumption as to the alien's  nonresidence may be overcome by proof--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the alien, at least six months before the date he so  presents himself, has filed a declaration of his intention to become a  citizen of the United States under the naturalization laws; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the alien, at least six months before the date he so  presents himself, has filed Form 1078 or its equivalent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Of acts and statements of the alien showing a definite  intention to acquire residence in the United States or showing that his  stay in the United States has been of such an extended nature as to  constitute him a resident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other aliens. In the case of other aliens, the presumption as to  the alien's nonresidence may be overcome by proof--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the alien has filed a declaration of his intention to  become a citizen of the United States under the naturalization laws; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the alien has filed Form 1078 or its equivalent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Of acts and statements of the alien showing a definite  intention to acquire residence in the United States or showing that his  stay in the United States has been of such an extended nature as to  constitute him a resident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certificate. If, in the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or  (2)(iii) of this section, the internal revenue officer or employee who  examines the alien is in doubt as to the facts, such officer or employee  may, to assist him in determining the facts, require a certificate or  certificates setting forth the facts relied upon by the alien seeking to  overcome the presumption. Each such   certificate, which shall contain, or be verified by, a written  declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, shall be  executed by some credible person or persons, other than the alien and  members of his family, who have known the alien at least six months  before the date of execution of the certificate or certificates.</p>
