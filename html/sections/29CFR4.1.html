Sec. 4.1b  Payment of minimum compensation based on collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits applicable to employmentunder predecessor contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 4(c) of the Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended provides special minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements applicable to every contractor and subcontractor under a contract which succeeds a contract subject to the Act and under which substantially the same services as under the predecessor contract are furnished in the same locality. Section 4(c) provides that no such contractor or subcontractor shall pay any service employee employed on the contract work less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement as a result of arms-length negotiations, to which such service employees would have been entitled if they were employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement. If, however, the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with the regulations set forth in Sec. 4.10 of this subpart and parts 6 and 8 of this title that in any of the foregoing circumstances such wages and fringe benefits are substantially at variance with those which prevail for service of a character similar in the locality, those wages and/or fringe benefits in such collective bargaining agreement which are found to be substantially at variance shall not apply, and a new wage determination shall be issued. If the contract has been awarded and work begun prior to a finding that the wages and/or fringe benefits in a collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those prevailing in the locality, the payment obligation of such contractor or subcontractor with respect to the wages and fringe benefits contained in the new wage determination shall be applicable as of the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision or, where the decision is reviewed by the Administrative Review Board, the date of the decision of the Administrative Review Board. (See also Sec. 4.163(c).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act, the application of section 4(c) is made subject to the following variation in the circumstances and under the conditions described: The wage rates and fringe benefits provided for in any collective bargaining agreement applicable to the performance of work under the predecessor contract which is consummated during the period of performance of such contract shall not be effective for purposes of the successor contract under the provisions of section 4(c) of the Act or under any wage determination implementing such section issued pursuant to section 2(a) of the Act, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a successor contract for which bids have been invited by formal advertising, notice of the terms of such new or changed collective bargaining agreement is received by the contracting agency less than 10 days before the date set for opening of bids, provided that the contracting agency finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of the terms of a new or changed collective bargaining agreement is received by the agency after award of a successor contract to be entered into pursuant to negotiations or as a result of the execution of a renewal option or an extension of the initial contract term, provided that the contract start of performance is within 30 days of such award or renewal option or extension. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days from the award, and/or performance of such procurement does not commence within this 30-day period, any notice of the terms of a new or changed collective bargaining agreement received by the agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the contract will be effective for purposes of the successor contract under section 4(c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The limitations in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section shall apply only if the contracting officer has given both the incumbent (predecessor) contractor and his employees' collective bargaining representative written notification at least 30 days in advance of all applicable estimated procurement dates, including issue of bid solicitation, bid opening, date of award, commencement of negotiations, receipt of proposals, or the commencement date of a contract resulting from a negotiation, option, or extension, as the case may be.</p>
