                                Sec.  1054.626  What special provisions apply to equipment imported
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes requirements that apply to equipment manufacturers using the provisions of Sec.  1054.625 for equipment produced outside the United States. Note that Sec.  1054.625 limits these provisions to equipment manufacturers that install some engines and have primary responsibility for designing and manufacturing equipment. Companies that import equipment into the United States without meeting these criteria are not eligible for allowances under Sec.  1054.625. Such importers may import equipment with exempted engines only as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You or someone else may import your equipment with exempted engines under this section if you comply with the provisions in Sec.  1054.625 and commit to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give any EPA inspector or auditor complete and immediate access to inspect and audit, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspections and audits may be announced or unannounced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspections and audits may be performed by EPA employees or EPA contractors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must provide access to any location where--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any nonroad engine, equipment, or vehicle is produced or stored.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Documents related to manufacturer operations are kept.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Equipment, engines, or vehicles are tested or stored for testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You must provide any documents requested by an EPA inspector or auditor that are related to matters covered by the inspections or audit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> EPA inspections and audits may include review and copying of any documents related to demonstrating compliance with the exemptions in Sec.  1054.625.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> EPA inspections and audits may include inspection and evaluation of

complete or incomplete equipment, engines, or vehicles, and interviewing employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> You must make any of your employees available for interview by the EPA inspector or auditor, on request, within a reasonable time period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> You must provide English language translations of any documents to an EPA inspector or auditor, on request, within 10 working days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> You must provide English-language interpreters to accompany EPA inspectors and auditors, on request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The forum for any civil or criminal enforcement action related to the provisions of this section for violations of the Clean Air Act or regulations promulgated thereunder shall be governed by the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The substantive and procedural laws of the United States shall apply to any civil or criminal enforcement action against you or any of your officers or employees related to the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide the notification required by Sec.  1054.625(g). Include in the notice of intent in Sec.  1054.625(g)(1) a commitment to comply with the requirements and obligations of Sec.  1054.625 and this section. This commitment must be signed by the owner or president.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You, your agents, officers, and employees must not seek to detain or to impose civil or criminal remedies against EPA inspectors or auditors, whether EPA employees or EPA contractors, for actions performed within the scope of EPA employment related to the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> By submitting notification of your intent to use the provisions of Sec.  1054.625, producing and exporting for resale to the United States nonroad equipment under this section, or taking other actions to comply with the requirements of this part, you, your agents, officers, and employees, without exception, become subject to the full operation of the administrative and judicial enforcement powers and provisions of the United States as described in 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2), without limitation based on sovereign immunity, for conduct that violates the requirements applicable to you under this part 1054--including such conduct that violates 18 U.S.C. 1001, 42 U.S.C. 7413(c)(2), or other applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act--with respect to actions instituted against you and your agents, officers, and employees in any court or other tribunal in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any report or other document you submit to us must be in the English language or include a complete translation in English.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> You may be required to post a bond to cover any potential enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act before you or anyone else imports your equipment with exempted engines under this section, as specified in Sec.  1054.690. Use the bond amount specified in Sec.  1054.690 without adjusting for inflation. Note that you may post a single bond to meet the requirements of this section and Sec.  1054.690 together.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply to importers that do not install engines into equipment and do not have primary responsibility for designing and manufacturing equipment. Such importers may import equipment with engines exempted under Sec.  1054.625 only if each engine is exempted under an allowance provided to an equipment manufacturer meeting the requirements of Sec.  1054.625 and this section. You must notify us of your intent to use the provisions of this section and send us an annual report, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the Designated Compliance Officer in writing before you use the provisions of Sec.  1054.625.
