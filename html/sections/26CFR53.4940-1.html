                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> which is a private foundation shall be reported on Form 5227.  The tax imposed by section 4940(b) and this section is to be paid  annually at the time the organization is required to pay its income  taxes imposed under subtitle A. Except as otherwise provided herein, no  exclusions or deductions from gross investment income or credits against  tax are allowable under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Taxable foundations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The excise tax imposed under section  4940 on private foundations which are not exempt from taxation under  section 501(a) is equal to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount (if any) by which the sum of</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The tax on net investment income imposed under section 4940(a),  computed as if such private foundation were exempt from taxation under  section 501(a) and described in section 501(c)(3) for the taxable year,  plus</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the tax which would have been imposed under  section 511 for such taxable year if such private foundation had been  exempt from taxation under section 501(a), exceeds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The tax imposed under subtitle A on such private foundation for  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Assume that the tax liability under subtitle A for  private foundation X, which is not exempt from taxation under section  501(a) for 1970, is $10,000. Had X been exempt under section 501(a) for  1970, the tax imposed under section 4940(a) would have been $4,000 and  the tax imposed under section 511 would have been $7,000. The excess of  the sum of the taxes which would have been imposed under sections  4940(a) and 511 ($11,000) over the tax that was imposed under subtitle A  ($10,000) is $1,000, the amount of the tax imposed on such organization  under section 4940(b).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the facts stated in Example (1), except that the  tax liability under subtitle A is $15,000 rather than $10,000. Because  the sum of the taxes which would have been imposed under sections  4940(a) and 511 ($11,000) does not exceed the tax that was imposed under  subtitle A ($15,000), there is no tax imposed under section 4940(b) with  respect to such foundation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Net investment income defined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  section 4940(a), net investment income of a private foundation is the  amount by which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the gross investment income (as defined in section  4940(c)(2) and paragraph (d) of this section) and the capital gain net  income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1,  1977) (within the meaning of section 4940(c)(4) and paragraph (f) of  this section) exceeds</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The deductions allowed by section 4940(c)(3) and paragraph (e)  of this section.  Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this section,  net investment income shall be determined under the principles of  Subtitle A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tax-exempt income. For purposes of computing net investment  income under section 4940, the provisions of section 103 (relating to  interest on certain governmental obligations) and section 265 (relating  to expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt income) and the  regulations thereunder shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gross investment income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  paragraph (c) of this section, ``gross investment income'' means the  gross amounts of income from interest, dividends, rents, and royalties  (including overriding royalties) received by a private foundation from  all sources, but does not include such income to the extent included in  computing the tax imposed by section 511. Under this definition,  interest, dividends, rents, and royalties derived from assets devoted to  charitable activities are includible in gross investment income.  Therefore, for example, interest received on a student loan would be  includible in the gross investment income of a private foundation making  such loan. For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, gross  investment income also includes the items of investment income described  in Sec. 1.512(b)-1(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the income of such trust attributable to transfers  in trust after May 26, 1969, shall retain its character in the hands of  a distributee private foundation for purposes of section 4940 (unless  such income is taken into account because of the application of section  671).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of certain distributions in redemption of stock. For  purposes of applying section 302(b)(1), any distribution made to a  private foundation by a disqualified person (as defined in section  4946(a)), in redemption of stock held by such private foundation in a  business enterprise shall be treated as not essentially equivalent to a  dividend if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) Such  redemption is of stock which was owned by a private foundation on May  26, 1969 (or which is acquired by a private foundation under the terms  of a trust which was irrevocable on May 26, 1969, or under the terms of  a will executed on or before   such date, which is in effect on such date and at all times thereafter,  or would have passed under such a will but before that time actually  passes under a trust which would have met the test of this subdivision  but for the fact that the trust was revocable (but was not in fact  revoked)); (ii) such foundation is required to dispose of such property  in order not to be liable for tax under section 4943 (relating to taxes  on excess business holdings); and (iii) such foundation receives in  return an amount which equals or exceeds the fair market value of such  property at the time of such disposition or at the time a contract for  such disposition was previously executed in a transaction which would  not constitute a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of section  503(b) or the corresponding provisions of prior law). In the case of a  disposition before January 1, 1975, section 4943 shall be applied  without taking section 4943(c) (4) into account. A distribution which  otherwise qualifies under section 302 as a distribution in part or full  payment in exchange for stock shall not be treated as essentially  equivalent to a dividend because it does not meet the requirements of  this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deductions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of computing net  investment income, there shall be allowed as a deduction from gross  investment income all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or  incurred for the production or collection of gross investment income or  for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for  the production of such income, determined with the modifications set  forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Such expenses include that  portion of a private foundation's operating expenses which is paid or  incurred for the production or collection of gross investment income.  Taxes paid or incurred under this section are not paid or incurred for  the production or collection of gross investment income. A private  foundation's operating expenses include compensation of officers, other  salaries and wages of employees, outside professional fees, interest,  and rent and taxes upon property used in the foundation's operations.  Where a private foundation's officers or employees engage in activities  on behalf of the foundation for both investment purposes and for exempt  purposes, compensation and salaries paid to such officers or employees  must be allocated between the investment activities and the exempt  activities. To the extent a private foundation's expenses are taken into  account in computing the tax imposed by section 511, they shall not be  deductible for purposes of computing the tax imposed by section 4940.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where only a portion of property produces, or is held for the  production of, income subject to the section 4940 excise tax, and the  remainder of the property is used for exempt purposes, the deductions  allowed by section 4940(c)(3) shall be apportioned between the exempt  and non-exempt uses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No amount is allowable as a deduction under this section to  the extent it is paid or incurred for purposes other than those  described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Thus, for example,  the deductions prescribed by the following sections are not allowable:  (1) The charitable deduction prescribed under section 170 and 642(c);  (2) the net operating loss deduction prescribed under section 172; and  (3) the special deductions prescribed under Part VIII, Subchapter B,  Chapter 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deduction modifications. The following modifications shall be  made in determining deductions otherwise allowable under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The depreciation deduction shall be allowed, but only on the  basis of the straight line method provided in section 167(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The depletion deduction shall be allowed, but such deduction  shall be determined without regard to section 613, relating to  percentage depletion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The basis to be used for purposes of the deduction allowed for  depreciation or depletion shall be the basis determined under the rules  of Part II of Subchapter O of Chapter 1, subject to the provisions of  section 4940(c)(3)(B), and without regard to section 4940(c)(4)(B),  relating to the basis for determining gain, or section 362(c). Thus, a  private foundation must reduce the cost or other substituted or  transferred basis by an amount equal to the straight line depreciation  or cost depletion, without regard to whether the   foundation deducted such depreciation or depletion during the period  prior to its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969.  However, where a private foundation has previously taken depreciation or  depletion deductions in excess of the amount which would have been taken  had the straight line or cost method been employed, such excess  depreciation or depletion also shall be taken into account to reduce  basis. If the facts necessary to determine the basis of property in the  hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not  acquired by gift are unknown to a donee private foundation, then the  original basis to such foundation of such property shall be determined  under the rules of Sec. 1.1015-1(a)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The deduction for expenses paid or incurred in any taxable year  for the production of gross investment income earned as an incident to a  charitable function shall be no greater than the income earned from such  function which is includible as gross investment income for such year.  For example, where rental income is incidentally realized in 1971 from  historic buildings held open to the public, deductions for amounts paid  or incurred in 1971 for the production of such income shall be limited  to the amount of rental income includible as gross investment income for  1971.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Capital gain and losses--(1) General rule. In determining  capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning  before January 1, 1977) for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4940,  there shall be taken into account only capital gains and losses from the  sale or other disposition of property held by a private foundation for  investment purposes (other than program-related investments, as defined  in section 4944(c)), and property used for the production of income  included in computing the tax imposed by section 511 except to the  extent gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of such property  is taken into account for purposes of such tax. For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1972, property shall be treated as held for  investment purposes even though such property is disposed of by the  foundation immediately upon its receipt, if it is property of a type  which generally produces interest, dividends, rents, royalties, or  capital gains through appreciation (for example, rental real estate,  stock, bonds, mineral interests, mortgages, and securities). Under this  subparagraph, gains and losses from the sale or other disposition of  property used for the exempt purposes of the private foundation are  excluded. For example, gain or loss on the sale of the buildings used  for the exempt activities of a private foundation would not be subject  to the section 4940 tax. Where the foundation uses property for its  exempt purposes, but also incidentally derives income from such property  which is subject to the tax imposed by section 4940(a), any gain or loss  resulting from the sale or other disposition of such property is not  subject to the tax imposed by section 4940(a). For example, if a tax- exempt private foundation maintains buildings of a historical nature and  keeps them open for public inspection, but requires a number of its  employees to live in these buildings and charges the employees rent, the  rent would be subject to the tax imposed by section 4940(a), but any  gain or loss resulting from the sale of such property would not be  subject to such tax. However, where the foundation uses property for  both exempt purposes and (other than incidentally) for investment  purposes (for example, a building in which the foundation's charitable  and investment activities are carried on), that portion of any gain or  loss from the sale or other disposition of such property which is  allocable to the investment use of such property must be taken into  account in computing capital gain net income (net capital gain for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such taxable year.  For purposes of this paragraph, a distribution of property for purposes  described in section 170(c) </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (2)(B) which is a qualifying  distribution under section 4942 shall not be treated as a sale or other  disposition of property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The basis for purposes of determining gain from the  sale or other disposition of property shall be the greater of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fair market value on December 31, 1969, plus or minus all  adjustments   after December 31, 1969, and before the date of disposition under the  rules of Part II of Subchapter O of Chapter 1, provided that the  property was held by the private foundation on December 31, 1969, and  continuously thereafter to the date of disposition, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> (and without regard  to section 362(c)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining loss from the sale or other  disposition of property, basis as determined in subdivision (i)(B) of  this subparagraph shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> in any taxable  year, nor may such excess by used to reduce gains in either prior or  future taxable years, regardless of whether the foundation is a  corporation or a trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A private foundation holds certain depreciable real  property on December 31, 1969, having a basis of $102,000. The fair  market value of such property on that date was $100,000. For its taxable  year 1970 the foundation was allowed depreciation for such property of  $5,100 on the straight line method, the allowable amount computed on the  $102,000 basis. The property was sold on January 1, 1971, for $100,000.  Because fair market value on December 31, 1969, less straight line  depreciation of $5,100 ($94,900) is less than basis as determined by  Part II of Subchapter O of Chapter 1, $96,900 ($102,000 less $5,100), a  gain of $3,100 is recognized (i.e., sales price of $100,000 less the  greater of the two possible bases).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts in example 1, except that the sale  price was $95,000. Because the sale price was $1,900 less than the basis  for loss ($96,900 as determined by the application of subparagraph  (2)(ii) of this paragraph), there is a capital loss of $1,900 which may  be deducted against capital gains for 1971 (if any) in determining net  capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1976).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A private foundation holds certain depreciable real  property on December 31, 1969, having a basis of $102,000. The fair  market value of such property on that date was $110,000. For its taxable  year 1970 the foundation was allowed depreciation for such property of  $5,100 on the straight line method, the allowable amount computed on the  $102,000 basis. The property was sold on January 1, 1971, for $100,000.  Fair market value on December 31, 1969, less straight line depreciation  of $5,100 ($104,900) exceeds basis as determined by Part II of  Subchapter O of Chapter 1, $96,900 ($102,000 less $5,100), and will be  used for purposes of determining gain. Because basis for purposes of  determining gain exceeds sale price, there is no gain. There is no loss  because basis for purposes of determining loss ($96,900) is less than  sale price.
