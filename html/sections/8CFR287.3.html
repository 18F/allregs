                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of the Act will be examined  by an officer other than the arresting officer. If no other qualified  officer is readily available and the taking of the alien before another  officer would entail unnecessary delay, the arresting officer, if the  conduct of such examination is a part of the duties assigned to him or  her, may examine the alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this chapter, or take  whatever other action may be appropriate or required under the laws or  regulations applicable to the particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notifications and information. Except in the case of an alien  subject to the expedited removal provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A) of  the Act, an alien arrested without warrant and placed in formal  proceedings under section 238 or 240 of the Act will be advised of the  reasons for his or her arrest and the right to be represented at no  expense to the Government. The examining officer will provide the alien  with a list of the available free legal services provided by  organizations and attorneys qualified under 8 CFR part 1003 and  organizations recognized under Sec. 292.2 of this chapter or 8 CFR  1292.2 that are located in the district where the hearing will be held.  The examining officer shall note on Form I-862 that such a list was  provided to the alien. The officer will also advise the alien that any  statement made may be used against him or her in a subsequent  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Custody procedures. Unless voluntary departure has been granted  pursuant to subpart C of 8 CFR part 240, a determination will be made  within 48 hours of the arrest, except in the event of an emergency or  other extraordinary circumstance in which case a determination will be  made within an additional reasonable period of time, whether the alien  will be continued in custody or released on bond or recognizance and  whether a notice to appear and warrant of arrest as prescribed in 8 CFR  parts 236 and 239 will be issued.
