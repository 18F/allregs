PHMSA may issue an  interim final rule if it finds, for good cause, that notice and public  procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public  interest. PHMSA will clearly set out this finding in the interim final  rule. After receiving and reviewing public comments, as well as any  other relevant documents, PHMSA may revise the interim final rule and  then issue a final rule.</p>
