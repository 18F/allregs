                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the  transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another  continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position  identified with the transferring function or functions shall be  transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the  tenure of his or her employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee whose position is transferred under this subpart  solely for liquidation, and who is not identified with an operating  function specifically authorized at the time of transfer to continue in  operation more than 60 days, is not a competing employee for other  positions in the competitive area gaining the function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regardless of an employee's personal preference, an employee has  no right to transfer with his or her function, unless the alternative in  the competitive area losing the function is separation or demotion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section, the losing  competitive area must use the adverse action procedures found in 5 CFR  part 752 if it chooses to separate an employee who declines to transfer  with his or her function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The losing competitive area may, at its discretion, include  employees who decline to transfer with their function as part of a  concurrent reduction in force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An agency may not separate an employee who declines to transfer  with the function any sooner than it transfers employees who chose to  transfer with the function to the gaining competitive area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether the  employee wishes to transfer with the function when the function  transfers to a different local commuting area. The canvass letter must  give the employee information concerning entitlements available to the  employee if the employee accepts the offer to transfer, and if the  employee declines the offer to transfer. An employee may later change  and initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an employee may  not later change an initial declination of the offer to transfer.
