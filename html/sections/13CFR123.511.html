                                Sec. 123.511  How will SBA disburse Military Reservist EIDL funds?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Funds will be disbursed only after the essential employee has been  called to active duty, and you have provided a copy of the essential  employee's official call-up orders for active duty showing the date of  the call-up. SBA will disburse your funds in quarterly installments  (unless otherwise specified in your loan authorization agreement) based  on a continued need as demonstrated by comparative financial  information. On or about 30 days before your scheduled fund  disbursement, SBA will request ordinary and usual financial statements  (including balance sheets and profit and loss statements). Based on this  information, SBA will assess your continued need for disbursements under  this program. Upon making such assessment, SBA will notify you of the  status of future disbursements.
