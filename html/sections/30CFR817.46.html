In no case shall the structure be removed  sooner than 2 years after the last augmented seeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the siltation structure is removed, the land on which the  siltation structure was located shall be regraded and revegetated in  accordance with the reclamation plan and Sec. Sec. 817.111 through  817.116 of this chapter. Sedimentation ponds approved by the regulatory  authority for retention as permanent impoundments may be exempted from  this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any point-source discharge of water from underground workings to  surface waters which does not meet the effluent limitations of Sec.  817.42 shall be passed through a siltation structure before leaving the  permit area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sedimentation ponds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sedimentation ponds, when used, shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be used individually or in series;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be located as near as possible to the distrubed area and out of  perennial streams unless approved by the regulatory authority; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be designed, constructed, and maintained to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provide adequate sediment storage volume;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide adequate detention time to allow the effluent from the  ponds to meet State and Federal effluent limitations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Contain or treat the 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event  (``design event'') unless a lesser design event is approved by the  regulatory authority based on terrain, climate, other site-specific  conditions and on a demonstration by the operator that the effluent  limitations of Sec. 817.42 will be met;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Provide a nonclogging dewatering device adequate to maintain the  detention time required under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Minimize, to the extent possible, short circuiting;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Provide periodic sediment removal sufficient to maintain  adequate volume for the design event;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Ensure against excessive settlement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Be free of sod, large roots, frozen soil, and acid- or toxic- forming coal-processing waste; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Be compacted properly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Spillways.
