                            <p class="depth0">All gas production shall be measured by orifice meters or other  methods acceptable to the authorized officer on the lease pursuant to  methods and procedures prescribed in applicable orders and notices. The  measurement of the volume of all gas produced shall be adjusted by  computation to the standard pressure and temperature of 14.73 psia and  60 [deg]F unless otherwise prescribed by the authorized officer,  regardless of the pressure and temperature at which the gas is actually  measured. Gas lost without measurement by meter shall be estimated in  accordance with methods prescribed in applicable orders and notices.  Off-lease measurement or commingling with production from other sources  prior to measurement may be approved by the authorized officer.  [47 FR 47765, Oct. 27, 1982.
