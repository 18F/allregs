                            <p class="depth0">If it is shown that some person other than the veteran has title to property in a veteran's possession at the time of death, nothing contained in Sec. Sec.  12.0 to 12.12 shall be construed as prohibiting delivery of such property to the owner. A life insurance policy may be delivered to the beneficiary therein named if the insured is deceased, notwithstanding the veteran has designated a person to whom possession of his or her property at the field facility is to be transferred. In no case will funds or effects be delivered to a minor, or to an incompetent person other than as provided in Sec.  12.9 (a) and (c), but where any such person is entitled to title or possession delivery may be made to his or her guardian.
