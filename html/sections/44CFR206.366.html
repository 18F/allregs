(1) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets that term operating budget to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character.

property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the 3 fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax and other revenue rates and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received. This may result in decreasing the potential for loan cancellations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the local government's fiscal year is changed during the ``full 3 year period following the disaster'' the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite predisaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character. (1) For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal Finance Officers Association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal Finance Officers Association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Community Disaster Loan purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The local government's share for assistance provided under the Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's project application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cancellation application. A local government which has drawn loan funds from the Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through

(1) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the principal amount which is canceled will become a grant, and the related interest will be forgiven. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid immediately and that, if immediate repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the principal amount which is canceled will become a grant, and the related interest will be forgiven.
