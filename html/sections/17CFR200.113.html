                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opportunity to respond. All participants to a proceeding may respond to any allegations or contentions contained in a prohibited ex parte communication placed in the public record in accordance with Sec. 200.112. Such responses shall be included in the public record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interception of communications. All written communications addressed to the Commission respecting a proceeding will be deemed to be communications to the staff of the interested division and will be directed to that division by the Commission's mail room. A Commission member or decisional employee may instruct any of his assistants who are nondecisional employees to intercept any communication directed to him which might appear to violate this Code and authorize them either to transmit any such written communication to the staff of the interested division of the Commission, if it appears from the contents of the communication that the intent of the sender is consistent with such action, or to return the communication to the sender.
