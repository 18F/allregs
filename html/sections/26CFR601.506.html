                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Any notice or other written communication (or a copy  thereof) required or permitted to be given to a taxpayer in any matter  before the Internal Revenue Service must be given to the taxpayer and,  unless restricted by the taxpayer, to the representative according to  the following procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the taxpayer designates more than one recognized  representative to receive notices and other written communications, it  will be the practice of the Internal Revenue Service to give copies of  such to two (but not more than two) individuals so designated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a case in which the taxpayer does not designate which  recognized representative is to receive notices, it will be the practice  of the Internal Revenue Service to give notices and other communications  to the first recognized representative appointed on the power of  attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to give notice or other written communication to the  recognized representative of a taxpayer will not affect the validity of  any notice or other written communication delivered to a taxpayer.  Unless otherwise indicated in the document, a power of attorney other  than form 2848 will be presumed to grant the authority to receive  notices or other written communication (or a copy thereof) required or  permitted to be given to a taxpayer in any matter(s) before the Internal  Revenue Service to which the power of attorney pertains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cases where taxpayer may be contacted directly. Where a  recognized representative has unreasonably delayed or hindered an  examination, collection or investigation by failing to furnish, after  repeated request, nonprivileged information necessary to the  examination, collection or investigation, the Internal Revenue Service  employee conducting the examination, collection or investigation may  request the permission of his/her immediate supervisor to contact the  taxpayer directly for such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. If such permission is granted, the case file will be  documented with sufficient facts to show how the examination, collection  or investigation was being delayed or hindered. Written notice of such  permission, briefly stating the reason why it was granted, will be given  to both the recognized representative and the taxpayer together with a  request of the taxpayer to supply such nonprivileged information. (See  7521(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of direct notification. Permission to by-pass a  recognized representative and contact a taxpayer directly does not  automatically disqualify an individual to act as the recognized  representative of a taxpayer in a matter. However, such information may  be referred to the Director of Practice for possible disciplinary  proceedings under Circular No. 230, 31 CFR part 10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delivery of a check drawn on the United States Treasury--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  General. A check drawn on the United States Treasury (e.g., a check in  payment of refund of internal revenue taxes, penalties, or interest, see  Sec.  601.504(a)(5)) will be mailed to the recognized representative of  a taxpayer provided that a power of attorney is filed containing  specific authorization for this to be done.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Address of recognized representative. The check will be mailed  to the address of the recognized representative listed on the power of  attorney unless such recognized representative notifies the Internal  Revenue Service in writing that his/her mailing address has been  changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorization of more than one recognized representative. In the  event a power of attorney authorizes more than one recognized  representative to receive a check on the taxpayer's behalf, and such  representatives have different addresses, the Internal Revenue Service  will mail the check diretly to the taxpayer, unless a statement (signed  by all of the recognized representatives so authorized) is submitted  which indicates the address to which the check is to be mailed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cases in litigation. The provisions of Sec.  601.506(c)  concerning the issuance of a tax refund do not apply to the issuance of  a check in payment of claims which have been either reduced to judgment  or settled in the course (or as a result) of litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Centralized Authorization File (CAF) system--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information  recorded onto the CAF system. Information from both powers of attorney  and tax information authorizations is recorded onto the CAF system. Such  information enables Internal Revenue Service personnel who do not have  access to the actual power of attorney or tax information authorizations  to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine whether a recognized representative or an appointee is  authorized by a taxpayer to receive and/or inspect confidential tax  information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine, in the case of a recognized representative, whether  that representative is authorized to perform the acts set forth in Sec.   601,504(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Send copies of computer generated notices and communications  to an appointee or recognized representative so authorized by the  taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CAF number. A Centralized Authorization File (CAF) number  generally will be issued to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A recognized representative who files a power of attorney and a  written declaration of representative; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An appointee authorized under a tax information authorization.  The issuance of a CAF number does not indicate that a person is either  recognized or authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue  Service. Such determination is made under the provisions of Circular No.  230, 31 CFR part 10. The purpose of the CAF number is to facilitate the  processing of a power of attorney or a tax information authorization  submitted by a recognized representative or an appointee. A recognized  representative or an appointee should include the same CAF number on  every power of attorney or tax information authorization filed. However,  because the CAF number is not a substantive requirement (i.e., as listed  in Sec.  601.503(a)), a tax information authorization or power of  attorney which does not include such number will not be rejected based  on the absence of a CAF number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax matters recorded on CAF. Although a power of attorney or tax  information authorization may be filed in all matters under the  jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service, only those documents which  meet each of the following criteria will be recorded onto the CAF  system--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specific tax period. Only documents which concern a matter(s)  relating to a specific tax period will be recorded onto the CAF system.  A power of attorney or tax information authorization filed in a matter  unrelated to a specific period (e.g., the 100% penalty for failure to  pay over withholding taxes imposed by section 6672 of the Internal  Revenue Code, applications for an employer identification number, and  requests for a private letter ruling request pertaining to a proposed  transaction) cannot be recorded onto the CAF system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Future three-year limitation. Only documents which concern a  tax period that ends no later than three years after the date on a power  of attorney is received by the Internal Revenue Service will be recorded  onto the CAF system. For example, a power of attorney received by the  Internal Revenue Service on August 1, 1990, which indicates that the  authorization applies to form 941 for the quarters ended December 31,  1990 through December 31, 2000, will be recorded onto the CAF system for  the applicable tax periods which end no later than July 31, 1993 (i.e.,  three years after the date of receipt by the Internal Revenue Service).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documents for prior tax periods. Documents which concern any  tax period which has ended prior to the date on which a power of  attorney is received by the Internal Revenue Service will be recorded  onto the CAF system provided that matters concerning such years are  under consideration by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation on representatives recorded onto the CAF system. No  more than three representatives appointed under a power of attorney or  three persons designated under a tax information authorization will be  recorded onto the CAF system. If more than three representatives are  appointed under a power of attorney or more than three persons  designated under a tax information authorization, only the first three  names will be recorded onto the CAF system.  The fact that a power of attorney or tax information authorization  cannot be recorded onto the CAF system is not determinative of the  (current or future) validity of such document. (For example, documents  which concern tax periods that end more than three years from the date  of receipt by the IRS are not invalid for the period(s) not recorded  onto the CAF system, but can be resubmitted at a later date.)
