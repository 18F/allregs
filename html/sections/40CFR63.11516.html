All spray-applied painting of objects must meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. These requirements do not apply to affected sources located at Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing facilities, as described in Table 1, ``Description of Source Categories Affected by this Subpart,'' or affected sources that spray paint objects greater than 15 feet (4.57 meters), that are not spray painted in spray booths or spray rooms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spray booths or spray rooms must have a full roof, at least two complete walls, and one or two complete side curtains or other barrier material so that all four sides are covered. The spray booths or spray rooms must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth and leaves only though the filter.

The test coating for measuring filter efficiency shall be a high-solids bake enamel delivered at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a conventional (non-High Volume Low Pressure) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 psi air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter shall be 150 feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate compliance with this requirement and are not required to perform this measurement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must perform regular inspection and replacement of the filters in all spray booths or spray rooms according to manufacturer's instructions, and maintain documentation of these activities, as detailed in Sec. 63.11519(c)(5), ``Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> As an alternative compliance requirement, spray booths or spray rooms equipped with a water curtain, called ``waterwash'' or ``waterspray'' booths or spray rooms that are operated and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications and that achieve at least 98 percent control of MFHAP, may be used in lieu of the spray booths or spray rooms requirements of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards for spray painting application equipment of all objects painted for MFHAP control. All paints applied via spray-applied painting must be applied with a high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic application, airless spray gun, air-assisted airless spray gun, or an equivalent technology that is demonstrated to achieve transfer efficiency comparable to one of these spray gun technologies for a comparable operation, and for which written approval has been obtained from the Administrator. The procedure used to demonstrate that spray gun transfer efficiency is equivalent to that of an HVLP spray gun must be equivalent to the California South Coast Air Quality Management District's ``Spray Equipment Transfer Efficiency Test Procedure for Equipment User, May 24, 1989'' and ``Guidelines for Demonstrating Equivalency with District Approved Transfer Efficient Spray Guns, September 26, 2002'', Revision 0 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spray system recordkeeping.

All cleaning of paint spray guns must be done with either non-HAP gun cleaning solvents, or in such a manner that an atomized mist of spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created outside of a container that collects the used gun cleaning solvent. Spray gun cleaning may be done with, for example, by hand cleaning of parts of the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of these non-atomizing methods may also be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spray painting worker certification. All workers performing painting must be certified that they have completed training in the proper spray application of paints and the proper setup and maintenance of spray equipment. The minimum requirements for training and certification are described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
