                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> See the standard-setting part to determine if engine-based and/ or equipment-based standards apply. (Note: Some equipment is subject to  engine-based standards for exhaust emission and equipment-based  standards for evaporative emissions.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this part apply differently depending on  whether the engine or equipment is required to be certified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subpart A and subpart B of this part apply to engines and  equipment, without regard to which is subject to certification  requirements in the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subparts C, D, and E of this part apply to the engines or to the  equipment, whichever is subject to certification requirements in the  standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subpart F of this part generally applies to the engines or to  the equipment, whichever is subject to standards under the standard- setting part. However, since subpart F of this part addresses in-use  engines and equipment (in which the engine is installed in the  equipment), the requirements do not always distinguish between engines  and equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For issues related to testing, read the term ``engines/ equipment'' to mean engines for engines subject to engine-based testing  and equipment for equipment subject to equipment-based testing;  otherwise, read the term ``engines/equipment'' to mean engines for  sources subject to engine-based standards and equipment for sources  subject to equipment-based standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When we use the term engines (rather than engines/equipment),  read it to mean engines without regard to whether the source is subject  to engine-based standards or testing. When we use the term equipment  (rather than engines/equipment), read it to mean equipment without  regard to whether the source is subject to equipment-based standards or  testing. (Note: The definition of ``equipment'' in Sec.  1068.30  includes the engine.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The terminology convention described in this section is not  intended   to limit our authority or your obligations under the Clean Air Act.</p>
