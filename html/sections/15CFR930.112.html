A copy of the written request must be  sent to the agency with which the requesting agency disagrees, to the  Assistant Administrator, and to the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 15 days following receipt of a request for mediation the  disagreeing agency shall transmit a written response to the Secretary,  and to the agency requesting mediation, indicating whether it wishes to  participate in the mediation process. If the disagreeing agency declines  the offer to enter into mediation efforts, it must indicate the basis  for its refusal in its response. Upon receipt of a refusal to  participate in mediation efforts, the Secretary shall seek to persuade  the disagreeing agency to reconsider its decision and enter into  mediation efforts. If the disagreeing agencies do not all agree to  participate, the Secretary will cease efforts to provide mediation  assistance.</p>
