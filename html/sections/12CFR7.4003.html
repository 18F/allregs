                            <p class="depth0">A remote service unit (RSU) is an automated facility, operated by a customer of a bank, that conducts banking functions, such as receiving deposits, paying withdrawals, or lending money. A national bank may establish and operate an RSU pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh). An RSU includes an automated teller machine, automated loan machine, and automated device for receiving deposits. An RSU may be equipped with a telephone or televideo device that allows contact with bank personnel. An RSU is not a ``branch'' within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j), and is not subject to state geographic or operational restrictions or licensing laws.
