                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator will request all testing under Sec. 205.160 by means of a test request addressed to the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The test request will be signed by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement or his designee. The test request will be delivered to the plant manager or other responsible official as designated by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The test request will specify the vehicle category, configuration or configuration subgroup selected for testing, the manufacturer's plant or storage facility from which the vehicles must be selected, and the time at which the vehicles must be selected. The test request will also provide for situations in which the selected category, configuration, or configuration subgroup is unavailable for testing. The test request may include an alternative category, configuration, or configuration subgroup designated for testing in the event that vehicles of the first specified category, configuration, or configuration subgroup are not available for testing because the vehicles are not being manufactured at the specified plant, are not being manufactured during the specified time, or are not being stored at the specified plant or storage facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> If the manufacturer projects a yearly production of fewer than 50 vehicles of the specified category, configuration or configuration subgroup to be tested, then within five (5) days of receipt of the request, the manufacturer must notify the Administrator of such low volume production. The Administrator will then provide a revised test request specifying a testing plan which imposes no greater risk of failure (5%) at the acceptable quality level

(10%) than the plan in Appendix II. Upon receipt of the revised test request, the manufacturer must select and test a sample of vehicles from the category, configuration or configuration subgroup specified in the test request in accordance with this subpart and the conditions specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the manufacturer projects a yearly production of fewer than 50 vehicles of the specified category, configuration or configuration subgroup to be tested, then within five (5) days of receipt of the request, the manufacturer must notify the Administrator of such low volume production. The Administrator will then provide a revised test request specifying a testing plan which imposes no greater risk of failure (5%) at the acceptable quality level

(10%) than the plan in Appendix II. Upon receipt of the revised test request, the manufacturer must select and test a sample of vehicles from the category, configuration or configuration subgroup specified in the test request in accordance with this subpart and the conditions specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the manufacturer produces 50 or more vehicles of the specified category, configuration or configuration subgroup per year, then upon receipt of the test request, the manufacturer must select and test a sample of vehicles from the category, configuration or configuration subgroup specified in the test request in accordance with this subpart and the conditions specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> Any testing conducted by the manufacturer under a test request must be initiated within the time period specified in the test request; except that initiation may be delayed for increments of 24 hours or one business day where ambient test site weather conditions, or other conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer, in that 24-hour period, do not permit testing. The manufacturer must record the conditions for this period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any testing conducted by the manufacturer under a test request must be initiated within the time period specified in the test request; except that initiation may be delayed for increments of 24 hours or one business day where ambient test site weather conditions, or other conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer, in that 24-hour period, do not permit testing. The manufacturer must record the conditions for this period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer must complete noise emission testing on a minimum of ten vehicles per day unless otherwise provided by the Administrator or unless ambient test site conditions permit only the testing of a lesser number in which case the ambient test site weather conditions for that period must be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer is allowed 24 hours to ship vehicles from a sample from the assembly plant to the testing facility if the facility is not located at the plant or in close proximity to the plant. The Administrator may approve more time based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator may issue an order to the manufacturer to cease distribution in commerce of vehicles of a specified category, configuration, or configuration subgroup being manufactured at a particular facility, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test request issued by the Administrator under this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A cease distribution order will not be issued under paragraph (f) of this section if the manufacturer's refusal is caused by conditions and circumstances outside his control which render compliance with the provisions of a test request or with any other requirements of this section impossible. Conditions and circumstances outside the control of the manufacturer include, but are not limited to, the temporary unavailability of equipment and personnel needed to conduct the required tests caused by uncontrollable factors, such as equipment breakdown or failure or illness of personnel. Failure of the manufacturer to adequately plan for and provide the equipment and personnel needed to conduct the tests do not constitute uncontrollable factors. The manufacturer must bear the burden of establishing the presence of the conditions and circumstances required by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Any order to cease distribution will be issued only after a notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.


Sec. 205.160-2  Test sample selection and preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Vehicles comprising the sample which are required to be tested under a test request in accordance with this subpart must be selected consecutively as they are produced. Before the official test, the test vehicle must not be prepared, tested, modified, adjusted, or maintained in any manner unless such preparation, tests, modifications, adjustments or maintenance are part of the manufacturer's prescribed manufacturing and inspection procedures, and are documented in the manufacturer's internal vehicle assembly and inspection procedures, are required or permitted under this subpart, or are approved in advance by the Administrator. For purposes of this section, prescribed manufacturing and inspection procedures include quality control testing and assembly procedures normally performed by the manufacturer

on like products during early production if the resulting testing is not biased by this procedure. In the case of imported products, the manufacturer may perform adjustments, preparations, modification or tests normally performed at the port of entry by the manufacturer to prepare the vehicle for delivery to a dealer or customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Equipment or fixtures necessary to conduct the test may be installed on the vehicle if such equipment or fixtures have no effect on the noise emissions of the vehicle, as determined by the measurement methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a vehicle malfunction (i.e., failure to start, etc.) the manufacturer may perform the maintenance that is necessary to enable the vehicle to operate in a normal manner. This maintenance must be documented and reported in the SEA report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No quality control, quality assurance testing, assembly or selection procedures may be used on the test vehicle or any portion of the test vehicle including parts and subassemblies, unless such quality control, quality assurance testing, assembly or selection procedures are used normally during the production and assembly of all other vehicles of this configuration which will be distributed in commerce, are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a vehicle is unable to complete the noise tests, the manufacturer may replace the vehicle. Any replacement vehicle must be a production vehicle of the same configuration as the replaced vehicle or a noisier configuration and will be subject to all the provisions of these regulations. Any replacement must be reported in the SEA report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is 10 percent. The appropriate sampling plans associated with the designated AQL are contained in Appendix II or the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The vehicles of the category, configuration or configuration subgroup selected for testing must be assembled by the manufacturer for distribution in commerce using the manufacturer's normal production process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer must initiate testing with the vehicles of the category, configuration or configuration subgroup specified in the test request which are next scheduled for production after receipt of the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The manufacturer must keep on hand all products in the test sample until the sample is accepted or rejected in accordance with Sec. 205.160-6; except that vehicles actually tested and found to be in conformance with this regulation need not be kept.

Sec. 205.160-6  Passing or failing under SEA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A failing vehicle is one whose measured noise level is in excess of the applicable noise emission standard in Sec. 205.152.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The number of failing vehicles in a sample determines whether the sample passes or fails (See applicable tables in Appendix II). If the number of failing vehicles is greater than or equal to the number of Column B, the sample fails. If the number of failing vehicles is less than or equal to the number in Column A, the sample passes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pass or failure of an SEA takes place when a decision that a vehicle is a passing or failing unit is made on the last vehicle required to make a decision under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the manufacturer passes the SEA, he will not be required to perform any additional testing on subsequent vehicles to satisfy the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (b) of this section, based on a request by the manufacturer, accompanied by voluntarily ceasing distribution in commerce of vehicles from the category, configuration or configuration subgroup in question, manufactured at the plant which produced the products being tested. Before reinitiating distribution in commerce of that vehicle category, configuration or configuration subgroup from that plant, the manufacturer must take the action described in Sec. 205.160-8(a)(1) and (2).


Sec. 205.160-7  Continued testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If an SEA failure occurs according to paragraph (b) of Sec. 205.160-6, the Administrator may require that any or all vehicles of that category, configuration or configuration subgroup produced at that plant be tested before distribution in commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing of his intent to require continued testing of vehicles under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The manufacturer may request a hearing on the issues of whether the SEA was conducted properly; whether the criteria for SEA failure have been met; and the appropriateness or scope

of a continued testing order. If a hearing is requested, the hearing will begin no later than 15 days after the date on which the Administrator received the hearing request. Neither the request for a hearing nor the fact that a hearing is in progress will affect the responsibility of the manufacturer to commence and continue testing required by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any tested vehicle which demonstrates conformance with the applicable standard may be distributed into commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Any distribution into commerce of a vehicle which does not comply with the applicable standard is a prohibited act.


Sec. 205.160-8  Prohibition of distribution in commerce; manufacturer's remedy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator will permit the manufacturer to cease testing under Sec. 205.160-7 after the manufacturer has taken the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submission of a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the vehicles, describes the problem and/or quality control or quality assurance remedies to be taken by the manufacturer to correct the problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration that the specified vehicle category, configuration or configuration subgroup has passed a retest conducted in accordance with Sec. 205.160, and the conditions specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer may begin testing under paragraph (a)(2) of this section upon submitting the report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and may cease continued testing upon making the demonstration required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
