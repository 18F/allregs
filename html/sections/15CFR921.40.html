                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Sanctuaries and Reserve Division shall conduct, in  accordance with section 312 of the Act and procedures set forth in 15  CFR part 928, ongoing oversight and evaluations of Reserves. Interim  sanctions may be imposed in accordance with regulations promulgated  under 15 CFR part 928.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Assistant Administrator may consider the following  indicators of non-adherence in determining whether to invoke interim  sanctions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inadequate implementation of required staff roles in  administration, research, education/interpretation, and surveillance and  enforcement. Indicators of inadequate implementation could include: No  Reserve Manager, or no staff or insufficient staff to carry out the  required functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inadequate implementation of the required research plan,  including the monitoring design. Indicators of inadequate implementation  could include: Not carrying out research or monitoring that is required  by the plan, or carrying out research or monitoring that is inconsistent  with the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inadequate implementation of the required education/ interpretation plan. Indicators of inadequate implementation could  include: Not carrying out education or interpretation that is required  by the plan, or carrying out education/interpretation that is  inconsistent with the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inadequate implementation of public access to the Reserve.  Indicators of inadequate implementation of public access could include:  Not providing necessary access, giving full consideration to the need to  keep some areas off limits to the public in order to protect fragile  resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inadequate implementation of facility development plan.  Indicators of inadequate implementation could include: Not taking action  to propose and budget for necessary facilities, or not undertaking  necessary construction in a timely manner when funds are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inadequate implementation of acquisition plan. Indicators of  inadequate implementation could include: Not pursuing an aggressive  acquisition program with all available funds for that purpose, not  requesting promptly additional funds when necessary, and evidence that  adequate long-term state control has not been established over some core  or buffer areas, thus jeopardizing the ability to protect the Reserve  site and resources from offsite impacts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Inadequate implementation of Reserve protection plan. Indicators  of inadequate implementation could include: Evidence of non-compliance  with Reserve restrictions, insufficient surveillance and enforcement to  assure that restrictions on use of the Reserve are adhered to, or  evidence that Reserve resources are being damaged or destroyed as a  result of the above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Failure to carry out the terms of the signed Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) between the state and NOAA, which establishes a  long-term state commitment to maintain and manage the Reserve in  accordance with section 315 of the Act. Indicators of failure could  include: State action to allow incompatible uses of state-controlled  lands or waters in the Reserve, failure of the state to bear its fair  share of costs associated with long-term operation and management of the  Reserve, or failure to initiate timely updates of the MOU when  necessary.</p>
