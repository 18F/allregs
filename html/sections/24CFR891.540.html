                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disbursements of loan proceeds shall be made directly by HUD to  or for the account of the Borrower and may be made through an approved  lender, mortgage servicer, title insurance company, or other agent  satisfactory to the Borrower and HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All disbursements to the Borrower shall be made on a periodic  basis in an amount not to exceed the HUD-approved cost of portions of  construction or rehabilitation work completed and in place (except as  modified in paragraph (d) of this section), minus the appropriate  holdback, as determined by the field office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requisitions for loan disbursements shall be submitted by the  Borrower on forms to be prescribed by the Assistant Secretary and shall  be accompanied by such additional information as the field office may  require in order to approve loan disbursements under subpart E of this  part, including but not limited to evidence of compliance with the  Davis-Bacon Act, Department of Labor regulations, all applicable zoning,  building, and other governmental requirements, and such evidence of  continued priority of the mortgage of the Borrower as the Assistant  Secretary may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Storage. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A loan disbursement may be made for up to 90  percent of the   invoice value (to exclude costs of transportation and storage) of the  building components stored off-site if the components are stored at a  location approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each building component shall be adequately marked so as to be  readily identifiable in the inventory of the off-site location. It shall  be kept together with all other building components of the same  manufacturer intended for use in the same project for which loan  disbursements have been made and separate and apart from similar units  not for use in the project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Storage costs, if any, shall be borne the general contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responsibility for transportation, storage and insurance of off- site building components. The general contractor of the project shall  have the responsibility for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Insuring the components in the name of the Borrower while in  transit and storage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Delivering or contracting for the delivery of the components to  the storage area and to the construction site, including payment of  freight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loan disbursements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before a loan disbursement for a  building component stored off-site is made, the Borrower shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Obtain a bill of sale for the component;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide HUD with a security agreement pledged by a first lien on  the building components with the exception of such other liens or  encumbrances as may be approved by HUD; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> File a financing statement in accordance with the Uniform  Commercial Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before each loan disbursement for building components stored  off-site is made the manufacturer and the general contractor shall  certify to HUD that the components, in their intended use, comply with  HUD-approved contract plan and specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Loan disbursements may be made only for components stored off- site in a quantity required to permit uninterrupted installation at the  site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At no time shall the invoice value of building components being  stored off-site, for which advances have been insured, represent more  than 25 percent of the total estimated construction costs for the  insured mortgaged project as specified in the construction contract.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and other regulatory requirements  that set bonding requirements, the percentage of total estimated  construction costs insured by advances under this section may exceed 25  percent but not 50 percent if the mortgagor furnishes assurance of  completion in the form of a corporate surety bond for the payment and  performance each in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the  construction contract. In no event will insurance of components stored  off-site be made in the absence of a payment and performance bond.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> No single loan disbursement which is to be made shall be in an  amount less than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars.</p>
