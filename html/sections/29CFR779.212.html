                                Sec. 779.212  Enterprise must consist of related activities performed
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The related activities described in section 3(r) as included in the statutory enterprise are those performed for a ``common business purpose.'' (See the comprehensive discussion in 29 CFR part 776.) The term ``common business purpose'' as used in the definition does not have a narrow concept and is not intended to be limited to a single business establishment or a single type of business. As pointed out above, retailing, wholesaling and manufacturing may, under certain circumstances be engaged in for a ``common business purpose.'' (See Sec. 779.209.) An example was also cited where retailing and construction were performed for a common business purpose. (See Sec. 779.206.) On the other hand, it is clear that even a single individual or corporation may perform activities for different business purposes. (See Sec. 779.211.) Thus the reports of the House of Representatives cite, as an example of this, the case of a single company which owns several retail apparel stores and is also engaged in the lumbering business. It concludes that these activities are not part of a single enterprise. (H. Rept. 75, 87th Cong.,1st Sess., p. 7 and H. Rept. 1366, 89th Cong. 2d Sess., p. 9.)</p>
