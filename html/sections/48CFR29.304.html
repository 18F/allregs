                            <p class="depth0">The imposition of State and local taxes may result in special  contract considerations including the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With coordination of the agency-designated counsel, a contract  may (1) state that the contract price includes or excludes a specified  tax or (2) require that the contractor take certain actions with regard  to payment, nonpayment, refund, protest, or other treatment of a  specified tax. Such special treatment may be appropriate when there is  doubt as to the applicability or allocability of the tax, or when the  applicability of the tax is being litigated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicability of State and local taxes to purchases by the  Federal Government may depend on the place and terms of delivery. When  the contract price will be substantial, alternative places and terms of  delivery should be considered in light of possible tax consequences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Indefinite-delivery contracts for equipment rental may require  the contractor to furnish equipment in any of the States. Since leased  equipment remains the contractor's property, States and local  governments impose a wide variety of property, use, or other   taxes on equipment leased to the Government. The amount of these taxes  can vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. See 29.401-1  for the prescription of the contract clause to be included in contracts  when delivery points are not known at time of contracting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The North Carolina State and local sales and use tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act authorizes counties and  incorporated cities and towns to obtain each year from the Commissioner  of Revenue of the State of North Carolina a refund of sales and use  taxes indirectly paid on building materials, supplies, fixtures, and  equipment that become a part of or are annexed to any building or  structure erected, altered, or repaired for such counties and  incorporated cities and towns in North Carolina. In United States v.  Clayton, 250 F. Supp. 827 (1965), it was held that the United States is  entitled to the benefit of the refund, but must follow the refund  procedure of the Act and the regulations to recover what it is due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Act provides that, to receive the refund, claimants must  file, within 6 months after the claimant's fiscal year closes, a written  request substantiated by such records, receipts, and information as the  Commissioner of Revenue may require. No refund will be made on an  application not filed within the time allowed and in such manner as the  Commissioner may require. The requirements of the Commissioner are set  forth in regulations that provide that, to substantiate a refund claim  for sales or use taxes paid on purchases of building materials,  supplies, fixtures, or equipment by a contractor, the Government must  secure from the contractor certified statements setting forth the cost  of the property purchased from each vendor and the amount of sales or  use taxes paid. In the event the contractor makes several purchases from  the same vendor, the certified statement must indicate the invoice  numbers, the inclusive dates of the invoices, the total amount of the  invoices, and the sales and use taxes paid. The statement must also  include the cost of any tangible personal property withdrawn from the  contractor's warehouse stock and the amount of sales or use tax paid by  the contractor. Similar certified statements by subcontractors must be  obtained by the general contractor and furnished to the claimant. Any  local sales or use taxes included in the contractor's statement must be  shown separately from the State sales or use taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The clause prescribed at 29.401-2 requires contractors to submit  to contracting officers by November 30 of each year a certified  statement disclosing North Carolina State and local sales and use taxes  paid during the 12-month period that ended the preceding September 30.  The contracting officer shall ensure that contractors comply with this  requirement and shall obtain the annual refund to which the Government  may be entitled. The application for refund must be filed each year  before March 31 and in the manner and form required by the Commissioner  of Revenue. Copies of the form may be obtained from the State of North  Carolina, Department of Revenue, P.O. Box 25000, Raleigh, NC 27640.  [48 FR 42293, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 62 FR 40237, July 25, 1997]</p>
