                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of a qualified expert panel. Establishing a qualified expert panel is the first step in the process of requesting the addition of a new animal drug to the index. A qualified expert panel may not be established until FDA has determined that the new animal drug is eligible for indexing. The requestor must choose members for the qualified expert panel in accordance with selection criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section and submit information about these proposed members to FDA. FDA must determine whether the proposed qualified expert panel meets the selection criteria prior

to the panel beginning its work. Qualified expert panels operate external to FDA and are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for the selection of a qualified expert panel.

In addition, the requestor must notify FDA of the name of the qualified expert panel leader.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requestor must immediately notify FDA if it believes a qualified expert panel member no longer meets the selection criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section or is otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a qualified expert panel member cannot complete the review for which he or she was selected, the requestor must either choose a replacement or justify the continued work of the panel in the absence of the lost panelist.
