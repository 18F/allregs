                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You must monitor for leaks to cooling water by monitoring each heat  exchange system according to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section, monitoring each heat exchanger according to the requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section, or monitoring a surrogate parameter  according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If you  elect to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this  section, you may use alternatives in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this  section for determining the mean entrance concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em>  through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You define the equipment that comprises each heat exchange  system. For the purposes of implementing paragraph (a) of this section,  a heat exchange system may consist of an entire heat exchange system or  any combinations of heat exchangers such that, based on the rate of  cooling water at the entrance and exit to each heat exchange system and  the sensitivity of the test method being used, a leak of 3.06 kg/hr or  greater of the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart would be detected. For  example, if the test you decide to use has a sensitivity of 1 ppmv for  total HAP, you must define the heat exchange system so that the cooling  water flow rate is 51,031 liters per minute or less so that a leak of  3.06 kg/hr can be detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month  period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been  repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the  specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> or (B) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month  period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been  repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the  specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the  heat exchange system cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR  part 136. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. You  may validate 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to  this subpart according to the procedures in appendix D to this part.  Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each entrance and  exit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations,  correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if  applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of  significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 10 percent  greater than the entrance mean of the HAP (total or speciated) in Table  1 to this subpart or other representative substance, and the leak is at  least 3.06 kg/hr, you have detected a leak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em>  through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month  period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been  repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the  specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> or (B) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month  period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been  repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the  specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the  cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136, as long as the  method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 ppmv. Use the same  method for both entrance and exit samples. Validation of 40 CFR part 136  methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart may be determined  according to the provisions of appendix D to this part. Alternative  methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each heat exchanger  entrance and exit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations,  correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if  applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of  significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 1 ppmw or 10  percent greater than the entrance mean, whichever is greater, you have  detected a leak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be  used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific  electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity, or other representative  indicators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and  an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably  indicate the presence of a leak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The parameter level(s) or condition(s) that shall constitute a  leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the  selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The  monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of  parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the  selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, you have  detected a leak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(2)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If no leaks are detected, monitor quarterly thereafter until a  leak is detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been  repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the  specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Monitor the cooling water weekly for heat exchange systems at  new sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The records that will be maintained to document compliance with  the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a leak is identified by audio, visual, or olfactory  inspection, a method listed in 40 CFR part 136, or any other means other  than those described in the monitoring plan, and the method(s) specified  in the plan could not detect the leak, you shall revise the plan and  document the basis for the changes. You shall complete the revisions to  the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is  currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall  be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that  provide access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is  changed, you must retain the most recent superseded plan for at least 5  years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be  retained on-site or accessible from a central location by computer or  other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that the entrance mean concentration of the monitored  substance is zero; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine the entrance mean concentration of a monitored  substance at a sampling location anywhere upstream of the heat exchanger  or heat exchange system, provided that there is not a reasonable  opportunity for the concentration to change at the entrance to each heat  exchanger or heat exchange system.
