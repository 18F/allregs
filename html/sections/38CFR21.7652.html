The  certification of entrance or reentrance must clearly specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The course;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The starting and ending dates of the enrollment period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The credit hours or clock hours being pursued by the reservist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount of tuition, fees and the cost of books, supplies and  equipment charged to a reservist who is incarcerated in a Federal, State  or local prison or jail for conviction of a felony; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other information as the Secretary may find is necessary to  determine the reservist's monthly rate of educational assistance.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 38 U.S.C. 3482(g), 3680; Pub. L. 98-525)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Length of the enrollment period covered by the enrollment  certification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Educational institutions organized on a term, quarter  or semester basis generally shall report enrollment for the term,  quarter, semester, ordinary school year or ordinary school year plus  summer term. If the certification covers two or more terms, the  educational institution will report the dates for the break between  terms if a term ends and the following term does not begin in the same  or the next calendar month, or if the reservist elects not to be paid  for the intervals between terms. The educational institution must submit  a separate enrollment certification for each term, quarter or semester  when the certification is for a reservist who is incarcerated in a  Federal, State or local prison or jail for conviction of a felony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational institutions organized on a year-round basis will  report enrollment for the length of the course. The certification will  include a report of the dates during which the educational institution  closes for any interval designated in its approval data as breaks  between school years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a reservist enrolls in independent study leading to a  standard college degree concurrently with resident training, the  educational institution's certification will include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The enrollment date, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ending date for the period being certified. If the  educational institution has not prescribed maximum time for completion  of the independent study portion of the enrollment, the certification  must include an ending date for the independent study based on the  educational institution's estimate for completion.

L. 98-525)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of pursuit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reservist who is pursuing a  course leading to a standard college degree must have his or her  continued enrollment in and pursuit of the course verified for the  entire enrollment period. Verification of continued enrollment will be  made at least once a year and in the last month of enrollment if the  enrollment period ends more than 3 months after the last verification.  In the case of a reservist who completed, interrupted or terminated his  or her course, any communication from the reservist or other authorized  person notifying the VA of the reservist's completion of a course as  scheduled or an earlier termination date, will be accepted to terminate  payments accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The verification of pursuit will also include a report on the  following items when applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Continued enrollment in and pursuit of the course,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct and progress (See Sec. 21.7653(c)),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date of interruption or termination of training (See Sec.  21.7656(a)),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Changes in number of credit hours or clock hours of attendance  (See Sec. 21.7656(a)), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other changes or modifications in the course as certified at  enrollment.
