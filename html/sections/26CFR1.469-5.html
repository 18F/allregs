For rules relating to the participation in an activity of a personal service corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.468-1T(g)(2)(i)) or a closely held corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), see Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Participation of corporations. For rules relating to the participation in an activity of a personal service corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.468-1T(g)(2)(i)) or a closely held corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), see Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of certain retired farmers and surviving spouses of retired or disabled farmers. An individual shall be treated as materially participating for a taxable year in any trade or business activity of farming if paragraph (4) or (5) of section 2032A(b) would cause the requirements of section 2032A(b)(1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to real property used in such activity had the individual died during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with rules governing the treatment of passthrough entities. [Reserved]. See Sec. 1.469-5(h)(3) for rules relating to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Material participation for preceding taxable years. [Reserved]. See Sec. 1.469-5(j) for rules relating to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a calendar year individual, owns all of the stock of X, a C corporation. X is the general partner, and A is the limited partner, in P, a calendar year partnership. P has a single activity, a restaurant, which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(2)). During the taxable year, A works for an average of 30 hours per week in connection with P's restaurant activity. Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, A is treated as materially participating in the activity for the taxable year because A participates in the restaurant activity during such year for more than 500 hours. In addition, under Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(3)(i), A's participation will cause X to be treated as materially participating in the restaurant activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the partnership agreement provides that P's restaurant activity is to be managed by X, and A's work in the activity is performed pursuant to an employment contract between A and X. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, work done by A in connection with the activity in any capacity is treated as participation in the activity by A. Accordingly, the conclusion is the same as in Example 1. The conclusion would be the same if A owned no stock in X at any time, although in that case A's participation would not be taken into account in determining whether X materially participates in the restaurant activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. B, an individual, is employed fulltime as a carpenter. B also owns an interest in a partnership which is engaged in a van conversion activity, which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(2)). B and C, the other partner, are the only participants in the activity for the taxable year. The activity is conducted entirely on Saturdays. Each Saturday throughout the taxable year, B and C work for eight hours in the activity. Although B does not participate in the activity for more than 500 hours during the taxable year, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, B is treated for such year as materially participating in the activity because B participates in the activity for more than 100 hours during the taxable year, and B's participation in the activity for such year is not less than the participation of any other person in the activity for such year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. C, an individual, is employed full-time as an accountant. C also owns interests in a restaurant and a shoe store. The restaurant and shoe store are trade or business activities (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-

1T(e)(2)) that are treated as separate activities under the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-4T. Each activity has several full-time employees. During the taxable year, C works in the restaurant activity for 400 hours and in the shoe store activity for 150 hours. Under paragraph (c) of this section, both the restaurant and shoe store activities are significant participation activities of C for the taxable year. Accordingly, since C's aggregate participation in the restaurant and shoe store activities during the taxable year exceeds 500 hours, C is treated under paragraph (a)(4) of this section as materially participating in both activities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. [Reserved]. See Sec. 1.469-5(k) Example 5 for this example.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that D does not acquire any stock in the S corporation until 1994. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, D is not treated as participating in the activity for any taxable year prior to 1994 because D does not own as interest in the activity for any such taxable year. Accordingly, D materially participates in the activity for only one taxable year prior to 1995, and D is not treated under paragraph (a)(5) of this section as materially participating in the activity for 1995 or subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> E, a married individual filing a separate return for the taxable year, is employed full-time as an attorney. E also owns an interest in a professional football team that is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(2)). E does no work in connection with this activity. E anticipates that, for the taxable year, E's deductions from the activity will exceed E's gross income from the activity and that, if E does not materially participate in the activity for the taxable year, part or all of F's passive activity loss for the taxable year will be disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(a)(1)(i). Accordingly, E pays E's spouse to work as an office receptionist in connection with the activity for an average of 15 hours per week during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section any participation in the activity by E's spouse is treated as participation in the activity by E. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the work done by E's spouse is not treated as participation in the activity because work as an office receptionist is not work of a type customarily done by an owner of a football team, and one of E's principal purposes for paying E's spouse to do this work is to avoid the disallowance under Sec. 1.469-1T(a)(1)(i) of E's passive activity loss. Accordingly, E is not treated as participating in the activity for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, an individual, owns an interest in a partnership that feeds and sells cattle. The general partner of the partnership periodically mails F a letter setting forth certain proposed actions and decisions with respect to the cattle-feeding operation. Such actions and decisions include, for example, what kind of feed to purchase, how much to purchase, and when to purchase it, how often to feed cattle, and when to sell cattle. The letters explain the proposed actions and decisions, emphasize that taking or not taking a particular action or decision is solely within the discretion of F and other partners, and ask F to indicate a decision with respect to each proposed action by answering certain questions. The general partner receives a fee that constitutes earned income (within the meaning of section 911 (d)(2)(A)) for managing the cattle-feeding operation. F is not treated as materially participating in the cattle-feeding operation under paragraph (a) (1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> F's only participation in the cattle-feeding operation is to make certain managerial decisions. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, such management services are not taken into account in determining whether the taxpayer is treated as materially participating in the activity for a taxable year under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, if any other person performs services in connection with the management of the activity and receives compensation described in section 911(d)(2)(A) for such services. Therefore, F is not treated as materially participating for the taxable year in the cattle-feeding operation.
