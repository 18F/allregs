                                Sec.  16.132  Exemption of Department of Justice System--Personnel  Justice (DOJ), DOJ-006.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following Department of Justice system of records is  exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4);  (e)(1),(2),(3),(5) and (8); and (g) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5  U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k): Personnel Investigation and Security Clearance  Records for the Department of Justice (DOJ), DOJ-006. These exemptions  apply only to the extent that information in a record is subject to  exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject with an accounting of  disclosures of records in this system could inform that individual of  the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential law  enforcement or counterintelligence investigation, and thereby seriously  impede law enforcement or counterintelligence efforts by permitting the  record subject and other persons to whom he might disclose the records  to avoid criminal penalties, civil remedies, or counterintelligence  measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent  that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of records in the system could  reveal the identity of confidential sources and result in an unwarranted  invasion of the privacy of others. Disclosure may also reveal  information relating to actual or potential criminal investigations.  Disclosure of classified national security information would cause  damage to the national security of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records could interfere with  ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an  impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be  continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subsections (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable  to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subsection (e)(1). It is often impossible to determine in  advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate,  relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law  enforcement and counterintelligence, it is necessary to retain this  information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide  investigative leads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject  individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a  criminal investigation and thereby present a serious impediment to such  investigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this  subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal investigation and  compromise investigative efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Subsection (e)(5). It is often impossible to determine in  advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate,  relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law  enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in  establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice could give persons  sufficient warning to evade investigative efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Subsection (g). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent  that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy  Act.  [Order No. 297-2002, 67 FR 70163, Nov. 21, 2002]</p>
