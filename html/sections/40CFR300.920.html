                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dispersants. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To add a dispersant to the NCP Product  Schedule, submit the technical product data specified in Sec.  300.915(a) to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,  Washington, DC 20460. A dispersant must attain an effectiveness value of  45 percent or greater in order to be added to the Schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA reserves the right to request further documentation of the  manufacturers' test results. EPA also reserves the right to verify test  results and consider the results of EPA's verification testing in  determining whether the dispersant meets listing criteria. EPA will,  within 60 days of receiving a complete application as specified in Sec.  300.915(a) of this part, notify the manufacturer of its decision to list  the product on the Schedule, or request additional information and/or a  sample of the product in order to review and/or conduct validation  sampling. If EPA requests additional information and/or a product  sample, within 60 days of receiving such additional information or  sample, EPA will then notify the manufacturer in writing of its decision  to list or not list the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request for review of decision. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A manufacturer whose product  was determined to be ineligible for listing on the NCP Product Schedule  may request EPA's Administrator to review the determination. The request  must be made in writing within 30 days of receiving notification of  EPA's decision to not list the dispersant on the Schedule. The request  shall contain a clear and concise statement with supporting facts and  technical analysis demonstrating that EPA's decision was incorrect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator or his designee may request additional  information from the manufacturer, or from   any other person, and may provide for a conference between EPA and the  manufacturer, if appropriate. The Administrator or his designee shall  render a decision within 60 days of receiving the request, or within 60  days of receiving requested additional information, if appropriate, and  shall notify the manufacturer of his decision in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surface washing agents, surface collecting agents,  bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  To add a surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, bioremediation  agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent to the NCP Product  Schedule, the technical product data specified in Sec. 300.915 must be  submitted to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,  Washington, DC 20460. If EPA determines that the required data were  submitted, EPA will add the product to the Schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA will inform the submitter in writing, within 60 days of the  receipt of technical product data, of its decision on adding the product  to the Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The submitter may assert that certain information in the  technical product data submissions, including technical product data  submissions for sorbents pursuant to Sec. 300.915(g)(3), is  confidential business information. EPA will handle such claims pursuant  to the provisions in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Such information must be  submitted separately from non-confidential information, clearly  identified, and clearly marked ``Confidential Business Information.'' If  the submitter fails to make such a claim at the time of submittal, EPA  may make the information available to the public without further notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The submitter must notify EPA of any changes in the composition,  formulation, or application of the dispersant, surface washing agent,  surface collecting agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil  spill control agent. On the basis of this data, EPA may require  retesting of the product if the change is likely to affect the  effectiveness or toxicity of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The listing of a product on the NCP Product Schedule does not  constitute approval of the product. To avoid possible misinterpretation  or misrepresentation, any label, advertisement, or technical literature  that refers to the placement of the product on the NCP Product Schedule  must either reproduce in its entirety EPA's written statement that it  will add the product to the NCP Product Schedule under Sec.  300.920(a)(2) or (b)(2), or include the disclaimer shown below. If the  disclaimer is used, it must be conspicuous and must be fully reproduced.  Failure to comply with these restrictions or any other improper attempt  to demonstrate the approval of the product by any NRT or other U.S.  Government agency shall constitute grounds for removing the product from  the NCP Product Schedule.</p><p class="depth2">DISCLAIMER  [PRODUCT NAME] is on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's NCP  Product Schedule. This listing does NOT mean that EPA approves,  recommends, licenses, certifies, or authorizes the use of [PRODUCT NAME]  on an oil discharge. This listing means only that data have been  submitted to EPA as required by subpart J of the National Contingency  Plan, Sec. 300.915.  Subpart K--Federal Facilities [Reserved]</p>
