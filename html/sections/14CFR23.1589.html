If certification in more than one category is desired, the design category weights must be selected to make the term n1W constant for all categories or greater for one desired category than for others. The wings and control surfaces (including wing flaps and tabs) need only be investigated for the maximum value of n1W, or for the category corresponding to the maximum design weight, where n1W is constant. If the acrobatic category is selected, a special unsymmetrical flight load investigation in accordance with paragraphs A23.9(c)(2) and A23.11(c)(2) of this appendix must be completed. The wing, wing carrythrough, and the horizontal tail structures must be checked for this condition. The basic fuselage structure need only be investigated for the highest load factor design category selected. The local supporting structure for dead weight items need only be designed for the highest load factor imposed when the

particular items are installed in the airplane. The engine mount, however, must be designed for a higher side load factor, if certification in the acrobatic category is desired, than that required for certification in the normal and utility categories. When designing for landing loads, the landing gear and the airplane as a whole need only be investigated for the category corresponding to the maximum design weight. These simplifications apply to single-engine aircraft of conventional types for which experience is available, and the Administrator may require additional investigations for aircraft with unusual design features.</p><p class="depth0">A23.7 Flight loads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each flight load may be considered independent of altitude and, except for the local supporting structure for dead weight items, only the maximum design weight conditions must be investigated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Table 1 and figures 3 and 4 of this appendix must be used to determine values of n1, n2, n3, and n4, corresponding to the maximum design weights in the desired categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Figures 1 and 2 of this appendix must be used to determine values of n3 and n4 corresponding to the minimum flying weights in the desired categories, and, if these load factors are greater than the load factors at the design weight, the supporting structure for dead weight items must be substantiated for the resulting higher load factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each specified wing and tail loading is independent of the center of gravity range. The applicant, however, must select a c.g. range, and the basic fuselage structure must be investigated for the most adverse dead weight loading conditions for the c.g. range selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The following loads and loading conditions are the minimums for which strength must be provided in the structure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Airplane equilibrium. The aerodynamic wing loads may be considered to act normal to the relative wind, and to have a magnitude of 1.05 times the airplane normal loads (as determined from paragraphs A23.9 (b) and (c) of this appendix) for the positive flight conditions and a magnitude equal to the airplane normal loads for the negative conditions. Each chordwise and normal component of this wing load must be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum design airspeeds. The minimum design airspeeds may be chosen by the applicant except that they may not be less than the minimum speeds found by using figure 3 of this appendix. In addition, VCmin need not exceed values of 0.9 VH actually obtained at sea level for the lowest design weight category for which certification is desired. In computing these minimum design airspeeds, n1 may not be less than 3.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flight load factor. The limit flight load factors specified in Table 1 of this appendix represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive flight load factor is an aerodynamic force acting upward, with respect to the airplane.</p><p class="depth0">A23.9 Flight conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Each design condition in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be used to assure sufficient strength for each condition of speed and load factor on or within the boundary of a V-n diagram for the airplane similar to the diagram in figure 4 of this appendix. This diagram must also be used to determine the airplane structural operating limitations as specified in Sec. Sec. 23.1501(c) through 23.1513 and Sec. 23.1519.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Symmetrical flight conditions.

In addition, the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The design limit flight load factors corresponding to conditions ``D'' and ``E'' of figure 4 must be at least as great as those specified in Table 1 and figure 4 of this appendix, and the design speed for these conditions must be at least equal to the value of VD found from figure 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For conditions ``A'' and ``G'' of figure 4, the load factors must correspond to those specified in Table 1 of this appendix, and the design speeds must be computed using these load factors with the maximum static lift coefficient CNA determined by the applicant. However, in the absence of more precise computations, these latter conditions may be based on a value of CNA=1.35 and the design speed for condition ``A'' may be less than VAmin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conditions ``C'' and ``F'' of figure 4 need only be investigated when n3 W/S or n4 W/S are greater than n1 W/S or n2 W/S of this appendix, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If flaps or other high lift devices intended for use at the relatively low airspeed of approach, landing, and takeoff, are installed, the airplane must be designed for the two flight conditions corresponding to the values of limit flap-down factors specified in Table 1 of this appendix with the flaps fully extended at not less than the design flap speed VFmin from figure 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Unsymmetrical flight conditions. Each affected structure must be designed for unsymmetrical loadings as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The aft fuselage-to-wing attachment must be designed for the critical vertical surface load determined in accordance with paragraph SA23.11(c)(1) and (2) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The wing and wing carry-through structures must be designed for 100 percent of condition ``A'' loading on one side of the plane of symmetry and 70 percent on the opposite side for certification in the normal and utility categories, or 60 percent on the opposite side for certification in the acrobatic category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The wing and wing carry-through structures must be designed for the loads resulting from a combination of 75 percent of the positive maneuvering wing loading on both sides of the plane of symmetry and the maximum wing torsion resulting from aileron displacement. The effect of aileron displacement on wing torsion at VC or VA using the basic airfoil moment coefficient modified over the aileron portion of the span, must be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cm = Cm + 0.01[delta][mu] (up aileron side) wing basic airfoil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cm = Cm -0.01[delta][mu](down aileron side) wing basic airfoil, where [delta][mu] is the up aileron deflection and [delta] d is the down aileron deflection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Delta] critical, which is the sum of [delta][mu] + [delta] d must be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compute [Delta][alpha] and [Delta]b from the formulas:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.021</p><p class="depth0">Where [Delta]p = the maximum total deflection (sum of both aileron</p><p class="depth0">deflections) at VA with VA, VC, and VD described in</p><p class="depth0">subparagraph (2) of Sec. 23.7(e) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compute K from the formula:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.022</p><p class="depth0">where [delta][alpha] is the down aileron deflection</p><p class="depth0">corresponding to [Delta][alpha], and</p><p class="depth0">[delta]b is the down aileron deflection</p><p class="depth0">corresponding to [Delta] b as computed in step (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If K is less than 1.0, [Delta][alpha] is [Delta] critical and must be used to determine [delta]u and [delta]d. In this case, VC is the critical speed which must be used in computing the wing torsion loads over the aileron span.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If K is equal to or greater than 1.0, [Delta]b is [Delta] critical and must be used to determine [delta]u and [delta]d. In this case, Vd is the critical speed which must be used in computing the wing torsion loads over the aileron span.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Supplementary conditions; rear lift truss; engine torque; side load on engine mount. Each of the following supplementary conditions must be investigated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In designing the rear lift truss, the special condition specified in Sec. 23.369 may be investigated instead of condition ``G'' of figure 4 of this appendix. If this is done, and if certification in more than one category is desired, the value of W/S used in the formula appearing in Sec. 23.369 must be that for the category corresponding to the maximum gross weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each engine mount and its supporting structures must be designed for the maximum limit torque corresponding to METO power and propeller speed acting simultaneously with the limit loads resulting from the maximum positive maneuvering flight load factor n1. The limit torque must be obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a factor of 1.33 for engines with five or more cylinders. For 4, 3, and 2 cylinder engines, the factor must be 2, 3, and 4, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed for the loads resulting from a lateral limit load factor of not less than 1.47 for the normal and utility categories, or 2.0 for the acrobatic category.</p><p class="depth0">A23.11 Control surface loads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Each control surface load must be determined using the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and must lie within the simplified loadings of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limit pilot forces. In each control surface loading condition described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the airloads on the movable surfaces and the corresponding deflections need not exceed those which could be obtained in flight by employing the maximum limit pilot forces specified in the table in Sec. 23.397(b). If the surface loads are limited by these maximum limit pilot forces, the tabs must either be considered to be deflected to their maximum travel in the direction which would assist the pilot or the deflection must correspond to the maximum degree of ``out of trim'' expected at the speed for the condition under consideration. The tab load, however, need not exceed the value specified in Table 2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Surface loading conditions. Each surface loading condition must be investigated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Simplified limit surface loadings for the horizontal tail, vertical tail, aileron, wing flaps, and trim tabs are specified in figures 5 and 6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The distribution of load along the span of the surface, irrespective of the chordwise load distribution, must be assumed proportional to the total chord, except on horn balance surfaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The load on the stabilizer and elevator, and the load on fin and rudder, must be distributed chordwise as shown in figure 7 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In order to ensure adequate torsional strength and to account for maneuvers and

gusts, the most severe loads must be considered in association with every center of pressure position between the leading edge and the half chord of the mean chord of the surface (stabilizer and elevator, or fin and rudder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To ensure adequate strength under high leading edge loads, the most severe stabilizer and fin loads must be further considered as being increased by 50 percent over the leading 10 percent of the chord with the loads aft of this appropriately decreased to retain the same total load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The most severe elevator and rudder loads should be further considered as being distributed parabolically from three times the mean loading of the surface (stabilizer and elevator, or fin and rudder) at the leading edge of the elevator and rudder, respectively, to zero at the trailing edge according to the equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.004

These pilots loads must be assumed to act at the appropriate control grips

or pads as they would under flight conditions, and to be reacted at the attachments of the control system to the control surface horn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dual controls. If there are dual controls, the systems must be designed for pilots operating in opposition, using individual pilot loads equal to 75 percent of those obtained in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, except that individual pilot loads may not be less than the minimum limit pilot forces shown in the table in Sec. 23.397(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Ground gust conditions.

Most shock absorbers do not exactly follow a linear variation of load factor with time. Therefore, rational or conservative allowances must be made to compensate for these variations. On most landing gears, the time for wheel spin-up will be less than the time required to develop maximum vertical load factor for the specified rate of descent and forward velocity. For exceptionally large wheels, a wheel peripheral velocity equal to the ground speed may not have been attained at the time of maximum vertical gear load. However, as stated above, the drag spin-up load need not exceed 0.8 of the maximum vertical loads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dynamic spring-back of the landing gear and adjacent structure at the instant just after the wheels come up to speed may result in dynamic forward acting loads of considerable magnitude. This effect must be determined, in the level landing condition, by assuming that the wheel spin-up loads calculated by the methods of this appendix are reversed. Dynamic spring-back is likely to become critical for landing gear units having wheels of large mass or high landing speeds.

On the front side, provide a 52 by 12-inch (1321 by 305 mm) draft-free, high-temperature, glass window for viewing the sample during testing. Place a door below the window to provide access to the movable specimen platform holder. The bottom of the test chamber must be a sliding steel platform that has provision for securing the test specimen holder in a fixed and level position. The chamber must have an internal chimney with exterior dimensions of 5.1 inches (129 mm) wide, by 16.2 inches (411 mm) deep by 13 inches (330 mm) high at the opposite end of the chamber from the radiant energy source. The interior dimensions must be 4.5 inches (114 mm) wide by 15.6 inches (395 mm) deep. The chimney must extend to the top of the chamber (see figure F2).

Place the test specimens on a sheet of Kaowool MTM board or 1260 Standard Board (manufactured by Thermal Ceramics and available in Europe), or equivalent, either resting on the bottom lip of the sliding platform or on the base of the brackets. It may be necessary to use multiple sheets of material based on the thickness of the test specimen (to meet the sample height requirement). Typically, these non-combustible sheets of material are available in \1/4\-inch (6 mm) thicknesses. See figure F4.

This board serves as a heat retainer and protects the test specimen from excessive preheating. The height of this board may not impede the sliding platform movement (in and out of the test chamber). If the platform has been fabricated such that the back side of the platform is high enough to prevent excess preheating of the specimen when the sliding platform is out, a retainer board is not necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Place the test specimen horizontally on the non-combustible board(s).

A \3/4\-inch (19 mm) guide (such as a thin strip of metal) may be soldered to the top of the burner to aid in setting the flame height. The overall flame length must be approximately 5 inches long (127 mm). Provide a way to move the burner out of the ignition position so that the flame is horizontal and at least 2 inches (50 mm) above the specimen plane. See figure F6.

With the sliding platform pulled out of the chamber, install the calorimeter holding frame and place a sheet of non-combustible material in the bottom of the sliding platform adjacent to the holding frame. This will prevent heat losses during calibration. The frame must be 13\1/8\ inches (333 mm) deep (front to back) by 8 inches (203 mm) wide and must rest on the top of the sliding platform.

Heat sealing is the preferred method of preparing fiberglass samples, since they can be made without compressing the fiberglass (``box sample''). Cover materials that are not heat sealable may be stapled, sewn, or taped as long as the cover material is sufficiently over-cut to be drawn down the sides without compressing the core material. The fastening means should be as continuous as possible along the length of the seams.
