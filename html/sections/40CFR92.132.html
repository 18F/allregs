When samples are analyzed for some constituents dry and for some constituents wet, the wet concentrations must be converted to dry concentrations, and the equations for dry concentrations used. Also, the equations for HC, NMHC, CO, and NOX have multiple forms that are algebraically equivalent: An explicit form that requires intermediate calculation of Vm and DVol or WVol; and an implicit form that uses only the concentrations (e.g., DCO) and the mass flow rate of the fuel.
