Appendix C to Part 651--Mitigation and Monitoring</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The CEQ regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) recognize the following five means of mitigating an environmental impact. These five approaches to mitigation are presented in order of desirability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. This method avoids environmental impact by eliminating certain activities in certain areas. As an example, the Army's Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) program accounts for training requirements and activities while considering natural and cultural resource conditions on ranges and training land. This program allows informed management decisions associated with the use of these lands, and has mitigated potential impacts by limiting activities to areas that are compatible with Army training needs. Sensitive habitats and other resources are thus protected, while the mission requirements are still met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. Limiting the degree or magnitude of the action can reduce the extent of

an impact. For example, changing the firing time or the number of rounds fired on artillery ranges will reduce the noise impact on nearby residents. Using the previous ITAM example, the conditions of ranges can be monitored, and, when the conditions on the land warrant, the intensity or magnitude of the training on that parcel can be modified through a variety of decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the effect on the environment. This method restores the environment to its previous condition or better. Movement of troops and vehicles across vegetated areas often destroys vegetation. Either reseeding or replanting the areas with native plants after the exercise can mitigate this impact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. This method designs the action so as to reduce adverse environmental effects. Examples include maintaining erosion control structures, using air pollution control devices, and encouraging car pools in order to reduce transportation effects such as air pollution, energy consumption, and traffic congestion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments (40 CFR 1508.20). This method replaces the resource or environment that will be impacted by the action. Replacement can occur in-kind or otherwise; for example, deer habitat in the project area can be replaced with deer habitat in another area; an in-kind replacement at a different location. This replacement can occur either on the impact site or at another location. This type of mitigation is often used in water resources projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The identification and evaluation of mitigations involves the use of experts familiar with the predicted environmental impacts. Many potential sources of information are available for assistance. These include sources within the Army such as the USACHPPM, the USAEC, the MACOM environmental office, the ODEP, COE research laboratories, COE districts and divisions, and DoD Regional Support Centers. State agencies are another potential source of information, and the appropriate POC within these agencies may be obtained from the installation environmental office. Local interest groups may also be able to help identify potential mitigation measures.

The following examples illustrate the variety of possible measures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There are maneuver restrictions in areas used extensively for tracked vehicle training. These restrictions are not designed to infringe on the military mission, but rather to reduce the amount of damage to the training area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aerial seeding has been done on some installations to reduce erosion problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changing the time and/or frequency of operations has been used. This may involve changing the season of the year, the time of

day, or even day of the week for various activities. These changes avoid noise impacts as well as aesthetic, transportation, and some ecological problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reducing the effects of construction has involved using techniques that keep heavy equipment away from protected trees and quickly re-seeding areas after construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring and enforcement programs are applicable (40 CFR 1505.2(c)) and the specific adopted action is an important case (40 CFR 1505.3) if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is a change in environmental conditions or project activities that were assumed in the EIS, such that original predictions of the extent of adverse environmental impacts may be too limited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain, such as in the case of the application of new technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Major environmental controversy remains associated with the selected alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure of a mitigation measure, or other unforeseen circumstances, could result in serious harm to federal-or state-listed endangered or threatened species; important historic or archaeological sites that are either on, or meet eligibility requirements for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, or other public or private protected resources. Evaluation and determination of what constitutes serious harm must be made in coordination with the appropriate federal, state, or local agency responsible for each particular program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Five basic considerations affect the establishment of monitoring programs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Legal requirements. Permits for some actions will require that a monitoring system be established (for example, dredge and fill permits from the USACE). These permits will generally require both enforcement and effectiveness monitoring programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protected resources. These include federal-or state-listed endangered or threatened species, important historic or archaeological sites (whether or not these are listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places), wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and other public or private protected resources. Private protected resources include areas such as Audubon Society Refuges, Nature Conservancy lands, or any other land that would be protected by law if it were under government ownership, but is privately owned. If any of these resources are affected, an effectiveness and enforcement-monitoring program must be undertaken in conjunction with the federal, state, or local agency that manages the type of resource.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Major environmental controversy. If a controversy remains regarding the effect of an action or the effectiveness of a mitigation, an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program must be undertaken. Controversy includes not only scientific disagreement about the mitigation's effectiveness, but also public interest or debate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mitigation outcome. The probability of the mitigation's success must be carefully considered. The proponent must know if the mitigation has been successful elsewhere. The validity of the outcome should be confirmed by expert opinion. However, the proponent should note that a certain technique, such as artificial seeding with the natural vegetation, which may have worked successfully in one area, may not work in another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Changed conditions. The final consideration is whether any condition, such as the environmental setting, has changed (for example, a change in local land use around the area, or a change in project activities, such as increased amount of acreage being used or an increased movement of troops). Such changes will require preparation of a supplemental document (see Sec. Sec. 651.5(g) and 651.24) and additional monitoring. If none of these conditions are met (that is, requirement by law, protected resources, no major controversy is involved, effectiveness of the mitigation is known, and the environmental or project conditions have not changed), then only an enforcement monitoring program is needed. Otherwise, both an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program will be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Enforcement monitoring program. The development of an enforcement monitoring program is governed by who will actually perform the mitigation; a contractor, a cooperating agency, or an in-house (Army) lead agency. The lead agency is ultimately responsible for performing any mitigation activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contract performance. Several provisions must be made in work to be performed by contract. The lead agency must ensure that contract provisions include the performance of the mitigation activity and that penalty clauses are written into the contracts. It must provide for timely inspection of the mitigation measures and is responsible for enforcing all contract provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cooperating agency performance. The lead agency must ensure that, if a cooperating agency performs the work, it understands its role in the mitigation. The lead agency must determine and agree upon how the mitigation measures will be funded. It must also ensure that any necessary formal paperwork such as cooperating agreements is complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Lead agency performance. If the lead agency performs the mitigation, the proponent must ensure that needed tasks are performed, provide appropriate funding in the project budget, arrange for necessary manpower allocations, and make any necessary changes in the agency (installation) regulations (such as environmental or range regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effectiveness monitoring. Effectiveness monitoring is often difficult to establish. The first step is to determine what must be monitored, based on criteria discussed during the establishment of the system; for example, the legal requirements, protected resources, area of controversy, known effectiveness, or changed conditions. Initially, this can be a very broad statement, such as reduction of impacts on a particular stream by a combination of replanting, erosion control devices, and range regulations. The next step is finding the expertise necessary to establish the monitoring system. The expertise may be available on-post or may be obtained from an outside source. After a source of expertise is located, the program can be established using the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any technical parameters used must be measurable; for example, the monitoring program must be quantitative and statistically sound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A baseline study must be completed before the monitoring begins in order to identify the actual state of the system prior to any disturbance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The monitoring system must have a control, so that it can isolate the effects of the mitigation procedures from effects originating outside the action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The system's parameters and means of measuring them must be replicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Parameter results must be available in a timely manner so that the decision maker can take any necessary corrective action before the effects are irreversible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Not every mitigation has to be monitored separately. The effectiveness of several mitigation actions can be determined by one measurable parameter. For example, the turbidity measurement from a stream can include the combined effectiveness of mitigation actions such as reseeding, maneuver restrictions, and erosion control devices. However, if a method combines several parameters and a critical change is noted, each mitigation measurement must be examined to determine the problem.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix D to Part 651--Public Participation Plan</p><p class="depth0">The objective of the plan will be to encourage the full and open discussion of issues related to Army actions. Some NEPA actions will be very limited in scope, and may not require full public participation and involvement. Other NEPA actions will obviously be of interest, not only to the local community, but to others across the country as well.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To accomplish this objective, the plan will require:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dissemination of information to local and installation communities through such means as news releases to local media, announcements to local citizens groups, and Commander's letters.

Length should be determined by potential environmental issues, not project size. The EIS should be no longer than 300 pages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Describe the criteria for selecting alternatives, and discuss those alternatives, including the ``no action'' alternative, to be considered by the ultimate decision maker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Serve as a means to assess environmental impacts of proposed military actions, rather than justifying decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The EIS will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cover sheet. The cover sheet will not exceed one page (40 CFR 1502.11) and will be accompanied by a signature page for the proponent, designated as preparer; the installation environmental office (or other source of NEPA expertise), designated as reviewer; and the Installation Commander (or other Activity Commander), designated as approver. It will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following statement: ``The material contained in the attached (final or draft) EIS is for internal coordination use only and may not be released to non-Department of Defense agencies or individuals until coordination has been completed and the material has been cleared for public release by appropriate authority.'' This sheet will be removed prior to filing the document with the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A list of responsible agencies including the lead agency and any cooperating agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the statement and, if appropriate, the titles of related cooperating agency actions, together with state and county (or other jurisdiction as applicable) where the action is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the person at the agency who can supply further information, and, as appropriate, the name and title of the major approval authority in the command channel through HQDA staff proponent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A designation of the statement as a draft, final, or draft or final supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A one-paragraph abstract of the statement that describes only the need for the proposed action, alternative actions, and the significant environmental consequences of the proposed action and alternatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The date by which comments must be received, computed in cooperation with the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Summary. The summary will stress the major conclusions of environmental analysis, areas of controversy, and issues yet to be resolved. The summary presentation will focus on the scope of the EIS, including issues that will not be evaluated in detail. It should list all federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must be obtained prior to proposal implementation. Further, a statement of compliance with the requirements of other federal environmental protection laws will be included (40 CFR 1502.25). To simplify consideration of complex relationships, every effort will be made to present the summary of alternatives and their impacts in a graphic format with the narrative. The EIS summary should be written at the standard middle school reading level. This summary should not exceed 15 pages. An additional summary document will be prepared for separate submission to the DEP and the ASA(I&E;). This will identify progress ``to the date,'' in addition to the standard EIS summary which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Summarizes the content of the document (from an oversight perspective).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Outlines mitigation requirements (to improve mitigation tracking and the programming of funds).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identifies major and unresolved issues and potential controversies. For EIS actions that have been delegated by the ASA(I&E;), this document will also include status of requirements and conditions established by the delegation letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Table of contents. This section will provide for the table of contents, list of figures and tables, and a list of all referenced documents, including a bibliography of references within the body of the EIS. The table of contents should have enough detail so that searching for sections of text is not difficult.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Purpose of and need for the action. This section should clearly state the nature of the problem and discuss how the proposed action or range of alternatives would solve the problem. This section will briefly give the relevant background information on the proposed action and summarize its operational, social, economic, and environmental objectives. This section is designed specifically to call attention to the benefits of the proposed action. If a cost-benefit analysis has been prepared for the proposed action, it may be included here, or attached as an appendix and referenced here.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternatives considered, including proposed action and no action alternative. This section presents all reasonable alternatives and their likely environmental impacts, written in simple, nontechnical language for the lay reader. A no action alternative must be included (40 CFR 1502.14(d)). A preferred alternative need not be identified in the DEIS; although a preferred alternative generally must be included in the FEIS (40 CFR 1502.14(e)). The environmental impacts of the alternatives should be presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among the options that are provided the decision maker and the public (40 CFR 1502.14). The information should be summarized in a brief, concise manner. The use of graphics and tabular or matrix format is encouraged to provide the reviewer with an at-a-glance review. In summary, the following points are required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of all reasonable alternatives, including the preferred action, alternatives beyond DA jurisdiction (40 CFR 1502.14(c)), and the no action alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A comparative presentation of the environmental consequences of all reasonable alternative actions, including the preferred alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the mitigation measures and/or monitoring procedures (Sec. 651.15) nominated for incorporation into the proposed action and alternatives, as well as mitigation measures that are available but not incorporated and/or monitoring procedures (Sec. 651.15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Listing of any alternatives that were eliminated from detailed study. A brief discussion of the reasons for which each alternative was eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Affected environment (baseline conditions) that may be impacted. This section will contain information about existing conditions in the affected areas in sufficient detail to understand the potential effects of the alternatives under consideration (40 CFR 1502.15). Affected elements could include, for example, biophysical characteristics (ecology and water quality); land use and land use plans; architectural, historical, and cultural amenities; utilities and services; and transportation. This section will not be encyclopedic. It will be written clearly and the degree of detail for points covered will be related to the significance and magnitude of expected impacts. Elements not impacted by any of the alternatives need only be presented in summary form, or referenced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Environmental and socioeconomic consequences. This section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparison of impacts. It should discuss:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct effects and their significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect effects and their significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Possible conflicts between the proposed action and existing land use plans, policies, and controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Environmental effects of the alternatives, including the proposed action and the no action alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources associated with the proposed action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Relationship between short-term use of the environment and maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Urban quality, historic, and cultural resources, and design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Cumulative effects of the proposed action in light of other past, present, and foreseeable actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Means to mitigate or monitor adverse environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Any probable adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> List of preparers. The EIS will list the names of its preparers, together with their qualifications (expertise, experience, and professional disciplines) (40 CFR 1502.17), including those people who were primarily responsible for preparing (research, data collection, and writing) the EIS or significant background or support papers, and basic components of the statement. When possible, the people who are responsible for a particular analysis, as well as an analysis of background papers, will be identified. If some or all of the preparers are contractors' employees, they must be identified as such. Identification of the firm that prepared the EIS is not, by itself, adequate to meet the requirements of this point. Normally, this list will not exceed two pages. Contractors will execute disclosure statements specifying that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project. These statements will be referenced in this section of the EIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Distribution list. For the DEIS, a list will be prepared indicating from whom review and comment is requested. The list will include public agencies and private parties or organizations. The distribution of the DEIS and FEIS will include the CBTDEVs from whom comments were requested, irrespective of whether they provided comments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Index. The index will be an alphabetical list of topics in the EIS, especially of the types of effects induced by the various alternative actions. Reference may be made to either page number or paragraph number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Appendices (as appropriate). If an agency prepares an appendix to an EIS, the appendix will consist of material prepared in

connection with an EIS (distinct from material not so prepared and incorporated by reference), consist only of material that substantiates any analysis fundamental to an impact statement, be analytic and relevant to the decision to be made, and be circulated with the EIS or readily available.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

II--Terms</p><p class="depth0">Categorical Exclusion</p><p class="depth0">A category of actions that do not require an EA or an EIS because Department of the Army (DA) has determined that the actions do not have an individual or cumulative impact on the environment.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental (or National Environmental Policy Act) Analysis</p><p class="depth0">This term, as used in this part, will include all documentation necessary to coordinate and staff analyses or present the results of the analyses to the public or decision maker.</p><p class="depth0">Foreign Government</p><p class="depth0">A government, regardless of recognition by the United States, political factions, and organizations, that exercises governmental power outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Foreign Nations</p><p class="depth0">Any geographic area (land, water, and airspace) that is under the jurisdiction of one or more foreign governments. It also refers to any area under military occupation by the United States alone or jointly with any other foreign government. Includes any area that is the responsibility of an international organization of governments; also includes contiguous zones and fisheries zones of foreign nations.</p><p class="depth0">Global Commons</p><p class="depth0">Geographical areas outside the jurisdiction of any nation. They include the oceans outside territorial limits and Antarctica. They do not include contiguous zones and fisheries zones of foreign nations.</p><p class="depth0">Headquarters, Department of the Army proponent</p><p class="depth0">As the principal planner, implementer, and decision authority for a proposed action, the HQDA proponent is responsible for the substantive review of the environmental documentation and its thorough consideration in the decision-making process.</p><p class="depth0">Major Federal Action</p><p class="depth0">Reinforces, but does not have a meaning independent of, ``significantly affecting the environment,'' and will be interpreted in that context. A federal proposal with ``significant effects'' requires an EIS, whether it is ``major'' or not. Conversely, a ``major federal action'' without ``significant effects'' does not necessarily require an EIS.</p><p class="depth0">Preparers</p><p class="depth0">Personnel from a variety of disciplines who write environmental documentation in clear and analytical prose. They are primarily responsible for the accuracy of the document.</p><p class="depth0">Proponent</p><p class="depth0">Proponent identification depends on the nature and scope of a proposed action as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any Army structure may be a proponent. For instance, the installation/activity Facility Engineer (FE)/Director of Public Works becomes the proponent of installation-wide Military Construction Army (MCA) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M;) Activity; Commanding General, TRADOC becomes the proponent of a change in initial entry training; and the Program Manager becomes the proponent for a major acquisition program. The proponent may or may not be the preparer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In general, the proponent is the unit, element, or organization that is responsible for initiating and/or carrying out the proposed action. The proponent has the responsibility to prepare and/or secure funding for preparation of the environmental documentation.</p><p class="depth0">Significantly Affecting the Environment</p><p class="depth0">The significance of an action's, program's, or project's effects must be evaluated in light of its context and intensity, as defined in 40 CFR 1508.27.</p><p class="depth0">Section III--Special Abbreviations and Terms</p><p class="depth0">This part uses the following abbreviations, brevity codes or acronyms not contained in AR 310-50.
