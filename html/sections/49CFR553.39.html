                            <p class="depth0">The filing of a timely petition for reconsideration of any rule  issued under this part postpones the expiration of the statutory period  in which to seek judicial review of that rule only as to   the petitioner, and not as to other interested persons. For the  petitioner, the period for seeking judicial review will commence at the  time the agency takes final action upon the petition for  reconsideration.  [60 FR 63651, Dec. 12, 1995]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 553--Statement of Policy: Action on Petitions</p><p class="depth0">for Reconsideration</p><p class="depth0">It is the policy of the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for  reconsideration within 90 days after the closing date for receipt of  such petitions, unless it is found impracticable to take action within  that time. In cases where it is so found and the delay beyond that  period is expected to be substantial, notice of that fact, and the date  by which it is expected that action will be taken, will be published in  the Federal Register.    Sec. Appendix B to Part 553--Statement of Policy: Rulemakings Involving</p><p class="depth0">the Assessment of the Functional Equivalence of Safety Standards</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Based on a comparison of the performance of vehicles or  equipment, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  may tentatively determine that a foreign motor vehicle safety standard  is better than or at least functionally equivalent to a Federal Motor  Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS), either on its own motion or in  connection with a petition for rulemaking by any interested party under  49 CFR Part 552. Such determinations will be made in accordance with the  process described in the flowchart in Figure 1 of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the process, if NHTSA decides that there is reason to  believe that a foreign standard is better than or at least functionally  equivalent to a FMVSS in accordance with the process, it will commence a  rulemaking proceeding that may lead to the issuance of a proposal to add  the foreign standard as an alternative compliance option to the FMVSS,  to harmonize the FMVSS with the foreign standard or to upgrade the FMVSS  to the level of the foreign standard, as appropriate. Such a proposal  will request comment on the agency's tentative determination regarding  relative benefits and functional equivalence as well as the proposed  amendment. Final determinations regarding these matters will also be  made in accordance with the analytical criteria in the flowchart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As used in this appendix, the term ``standard'' refers to  mandatory requirements and thus has the same meaning given the term  ``technical regulation'' in Annex 1 to the World Trade Organization  Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MY98.017</p><p class="depth2">Explanation of Flowchart</p><p class="depth2">A. Ultimate Goal</p><p class="depth2">The ultimate goal in comparing standards is to assess the real world  safety performance of the covered vehicles or equipment. Particularly in  the case of crashworthiness standards, the most reliable basis for  making that assessment is fatality and injury data directly drawn from  actual crashes. Accordingly, NHTSA will make appropriate efforts to  ensure the availability of such data regarding crashes in the U.S.</p><p class="depth2">B. Guiding Principles</p><p class="depth2">Best Practices</p><p class="depth2">NHTSA pursues a ``best practices'' policy in comparing U.S. and  foreign safety standards, i.e., NHTSA will propose to upgrade its  standards if it tentatively concludes that a Country B standard offers  greater benefits than the counterpart FMVSS, and if upgrading appears  appropriate, considering the incremental costs and benefits and  applicable statutory criteria. (For a discussion of another type of  rulemaking proposal that may be considered in these circumstances, see  the paragraph below on comparisons that indicate that a foreign  standard's safety benefits are greater than those of the counterpart  FMVSS.)</p><p class="depth2">Conservatism</p><p class="depth2">1. NHTSA places priority on preserving the safety benefits of the  FMVSSs.</p><p class="depth2">2. NHTSA can best preserve those benefits by being conservative in  reaching any conclusion that a Country B standard is better than or at  least functionally equivalent to the counterpart FMVSS. One reason for  conservatism is that differences from vehicle model to vehicle model and  manufacturer to manufacturer in margins of compliance may confound  efforts to assess the relative benefits of two standards. Further, there  may be circumstantial differences, such as special environmental  conditions, driver demographics, driver behavior, occupant behavior  (e.g., level of safety belt use), road conditions, size distribution of  vehicle fleet (e.g., proportion of big versus small vehicles and  disparity between extremes), that could influence real world safety  benefits. These differences may result in a particular standard having a  safety record in a foreign country that would not necessarily be  repeated in the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Best Available Evidence</p><p class="depth2">1. NHTSA will base its comparison of standards on the best available  evidence. If available, estimates of real world safety benefits based on  fatality and injury data directly drawn from actual crashes are the best  evidence. If such data are not available, then estimates based on other  information, such as compliance test data, may be used, although  increased caution needs to be exercised in making judgment based on  those estimates. If sufficient crash data regarding real world safety  benefits are available, and a comparison of those benefits shows that  the Country B standard is less beneficial than the counterpart Federal  Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS), NHTSA would avoid wasting  resources making comparisons on the basis of less probative types of  evidence.</p><p class="depth2">2. The types of benefits examined in comparing two standards might  differ depending on whether the standards are crash avoidance standards  or crashworthiness standards. Translating differences in performance (an  input measure) into numbers of crashes or numbers of deaths and injuries  (output measures) is more difficult in the case of crash avoidance  standards. As a result, while the relative benefits of two  crashworthiness standards would typically be assessed in terms of their  impacts on deaths and injuries in crashes, the relative merits of two  different crash avoidance standards might well be assessed in terms of  their impact on vehicle or equipment performance.</p><p class="depth2">Sufficiency of Evidence</p><p class="depth2">1. Many types of data are available for a comparison of two  standards. Often there is an abundance of one type of data and little or  no data from other sources. If insufficient data are available, and such  data either cannot be generated through engineering analysis (e.g., real  world safety benefits estimates), or conducting additional research and  development is not cost effective, then NHTSA will stop consideration of  such data and consider the other available data instead.</p><p class="depth2">2. The essentially horizontal, left-to-right path through the  flowchart is intended to illustrate the sources of data that will be  considered and provide a rough idea of the priority they will receive.  Each step branches independently to the tentative determination of  relative benefits and functional equivalency by its ``yes'' path. This  may seem to preclude later steps once any ``yes'' path is encountered.  In practice, however, all data sources will be considered to the extent  that they are available before a final determination regarding these  matters is made.</p><p class="depth2">Reciprocity</p><p class="depth2">1. NHTSA will take steps to encourage reciprocity by other countries  in the making of functional equivalence determinations.</p><p class="depth2">2. When NHTSA's comparison of standards indicates that one of the  FMVSSs has benefits equal to or greater than the counterpart Country B  standard, NHTSA may forward the results of that comparison to Country B   and request that consideration be given by Country B to determining that  the FMVSS is better than or at least functionally equivalent to the  counterpart Country B standard, and to subsequently amending its  standard accordingly.</p><p class="depth2">C. Agency Decisions in Which Flowchart Is Used</p><p class="depth2">This flowchart guides agency decisions in connection with a  rulemaking proceeding that involves the issue of relative benefits and  functional equivalence.</p><p class="depth2">1. Decision whether to grant a rulemaking petition. If the agency  receives a petition for rulemaking based on a claim that one of Country  B's standards is better than or at least functionally equivalent to one  of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs), the agency will  consider the merits of the petition in accordance with 49 CFR Part 552,  Petitions for rulemaking, defect, and noncompliance orders, and with the  functional equivalence process set forth in the flowchart. If it appears  that there is reason to believe that Country B's standard provides  safety benefits are greater than or at least equal to those of the  FMVSS, the agency will likely grant the petition and commence a  rulemaking proceeding.</p><p class="depth2">The agency emphasizes that its priority with respect to  international harmonization is identifying and adopting those foreign  safety standards that represent best practices. Accordingly, if resource  limitations make it necessary to choose between competing petitions in  granting or processing them, the agency would give priority to petitions  asking the agency to upgrade one of its standards to the level of a  superior foreign standard over petitions simply asking the agency to add  a compliance alternative.</p><p class="depth2">2. Decision whether to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking. If  NHTSA grants the petition, it will proceed, as in any other rulemaking  regarding the FMVSSs, to determine whether amending an FMVSS would be  appropriate under the applicable statutory criteria in chapter 301 of  title 49, U.S.C. Following the process set forth in the flowchart, the  agency will use data submitted by the petitioner, supplemented by data  from other sources, to compare performance and tentatively determine  whether Country B's standard specified in the petition is better than or  at least functionally equivalent to the FMVSS specified in the petition.</p><p class="depth2">This comparison could have a variety of possible outcomes:</p><p class="depth2">a. The comparison may indicate that the foreign standard's safety  benefits are less than those of the counterpart FMVSS. If NHTSA  determines that the foreign standard results in fewer safety benefits  than the counterpart FMVSS, it will terminate the rulemaking proceeding.</p><p class="depth2">b. The comparison may indicate that the foreign standard's safety  benefits are approximately equal to those of the counterpart FMVSS. If  the agency tentatively determines that the safety benefits of a foreign  standard are approximately equal to those of a FMVSS, it will take one  of two steps in most instances. One possibility is that it will develop  a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend the FMVSS by  adding the foreign standard as an alternative to the existing  requirements of the FMVSS. The other possibility is that the agency will  develop an NPRM proposing to harmonize the FMVSS with the foreign  standard. This second approach would enable NHTSA to maintain a single  set of requirements and test procedures in its standard, thereby  minimizing any drain on its enforcement resources. An additional  possibility that might be considered in some instances would be  ``qualified functional equivalence.'' Under this third approach, the  agency would regard Country B's standard to be functionally equivalent  if it is supplemented by a specified requirement in the counterpart  FMVSS.</p><p class="depth2">c. The comparison may indicate that the foreign standard's safety  benefits are greater than those of the counterpart FMVSS. If NHTSA  tentatively determines that the foreign standard results in greater  safety benefits than the counterpart FMVSS, and if upgrading is  appropriate, based on the incremental benefits and costs and applicable  statutory criteria, the agency issues an NPRM proposing to upgrade the  FMVSS to the level of Country B's std. If upgrading is not appropriate,  NHTSA considers issuing an NPRM proposing to add the requirements of  Country B's std to the FMVSS as an alternative compliance option. The  proposal to add the compliance option would set forth the basis for the  agency's conclusion that upgrading the FMVSS is inappropriate. If NHTSA issues an NPRM, it would request comment on the tentative  determination and the proposed amendment.</p><p class="depth2">3. Decision whether to issue a final rule. Any final decision to  make a determination regarding relative benefits and functional  equivalency and to amend the FMVSS will be made in accordance with the  process in the flowchart and applicable law and only after careful  consideration and analysis of the public comments.

Summary of the Process Under the 1998 Global Agreement for</p><p class="depth2">Establishing Global Technical Regulations</p><p class="depth2">1. Proposal Stage</p><p class="depth2">A Contracting Party submits a proposal for either a harmonized or  new global technical regulation to the Executive Committee of the 1998  Global Agreement (i.e., the Contracting Parties to the Agreement). If  appropriate, the Committee then refers the proposal to a working party  of experts to develop the technical elements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth2">2. Recommendation Stage</p><p class="depth2">When a working party of experts recommends a harmonized or new  global technical regulation, it sends a report and the recommended  regulation to the Executive Committee. The Committee then determines  whether the recommendations are adequate and considers the establishment  of the recommended regulation.</p><p class="depth2">3. Establishment Stage</p><p class="depth2">If the Executive Committee reaches consensus in favor of that  recommended global technical regulation, the global technical regulation  is established in the Global Registry.</p><p class="depth2">B. Notice of Annual Work Program of WP.29</p><p class="depth2">Each year, NHTSA will publish a notice concerning the motor vehicle  safety, theft, and energy efficiency aspects of the annual program of  work for the UN/ECE's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle  Regulations (WP.29). Each notice will include:</p><p class="depth2">1. A calendar of scheduled meetings of WP.29 participants and  working parties of experts, and meetings of the Executive Committee; and</p><p class="depth2">2. A list of the global technical regulations that:</p><p class="depth2">a. Have been proposed and referred to a working party of experts, or</p><p class="depth2">b. Have been recommended by a working party of experts.  Periodically, the notice will also include a request for public comments  on the subjects for which global technical regulations should be  established under the 1998 Global Agreement. The agency will publish a  subsequent notice identifying the priorities on which NHTSA will focus  in the future under the 1998 Global Agreement.</p><p class="depth2">C. Public Meetings</p><p class="depth2">NHTSA will hold periodic public meetings on its activities under the  1998 Global Agreement. If the extent of recent and anticipated  significant developments concerning those activities so warrant, NHTSA  will hold a public meeting within the 60-day period before each of the  three sessions of WP.29 held annually. At each of these public meetings,  NHTSA will:</p><p class="depth2">1. Brief the public on the significant developments that occurred at  the session of WP.29, the meetings of the working parties of experts and  the meetings of the Executive Committee since the previous public  meeting;</p><p class="depth2">2. Based on the availability of provisional agendas, inform the  public about the significant issues to be addressed at upcoming session  of WP.29 and meetings of the working parties of experts and any votes  scheduled at the next session of the Executive Committee on recommended  global technical regulations; and</p><p class="depth2">3. Invite public comment and questions concerning those past  developments and upcoming issues and votes and the general positions  that the U.S. could take regarding those votes, and concerning any other  significant developments and upcoming matters relating to pending  proposed or recommended global technical regulations.     Appropriate agency officials will participate in the public meetings.  These public meetings may be held separately from or in conjunction with  the agency's quarterly meetings on its vehicle rulemaking and research  and development programs. The agency may hold additional public  meetings.</p><p class="depth2">D. Notices Concerning Individual Global Technical Regulations</p><p class="depth2">1.

Proposals by the U.S. (See Figure 1.)</p><p class="depth2">Before submitting a draft U.S. proposal for a global technical  regulation to WP.29, NHTSA will publish a notice requesting public  comments on the draft proposed global technical regulation. In the case  of a draft proposal for a harmonized global technical regulation, the  notice will compare that regulation with any existing, comparable U.S.  standard, including the relative impacts of the regulation and standard.  In the case of a draft proposal for a new global technical regulation,  the notice will generally discuss the problem addressed by the proposal,  the rationale for the proposed approach for addressing the problem, and  the impacts of the proposal. NHTSA will consider the public comments  and, as it deems appropriate, revise the proposal and any of its  supporting documentation and then submit the proposal to WP.29.</p><p class="depth2">b. Proposals by a Contracting Party other than the U.S. (See Figure  2.)</p><p class="depth2">After a proposal by a Contracting Party other than the U.S. has been  referred to a working party of experts and has been made available in  English by WP.29, NHTSA will make the draft proposal available in the  DOT docket (http://dms.dot.gov/). The agency will then publish a notice  requesting public comment on the draft proposal and will consider the  comments in developing a U.S. position on the proposal.</p><p class="depth2">2. Notice Requesting Written Comment on Recommended Global Technical</p><p class="depth2">Regulations</p><p class="depth2">If a working party of experts recommends a global technical  regulation and sends a report and the recommended regulation to the  Executive Committee, NHTSA will make an English language version of the  report and the regulation available in the DOT docket (http:// dms.dot.gov/) after they are made available by WP.29. The agency will  publish a notice requesting public comment on the report and regulation.  Before participating in a vote of the Executive Committee regarding the  establishment of the regulation, the agency will consider the comments  and develop a U.S. position on the recommended technical regulation.</p><p class="depth2">3. Notice Requesting Written Comment on Established Global Technical</p><p class="depth2">Regulations</p><p class="depth2">If a global technical regulation is established in the Global  Registry by a consensus vote of the Executive Committee, and if the U.S.  voted for establishment, NHTSA will publish a notice requesting public  comment on adopting the regulation as a U.S. standard. Any decision by  NHTSA whether to issue a final rule adopting the regulation or to issue  a notice terminating consideration of that regulation will be made in  accordance with applicable U.S. law and only after careful consideration  and analysis of public comments.</p><p class="depth2">E. Availability of Documents</p><p class="depth2">As we obtain English versions of key documents relating to motor  vehicle safety, theft or energy conservation that are generated under  the 1998 Agreement (e.g., proposals referred to a working party of  experts, and reports and recommendations issued by a working party), we  will place them in the internet-accessible DOT docket (http:// dms.dot.gov/). Within the limits of available resources, we will also  place the documents on an international activities page that will be  included in our Website (http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/ international/index.html).
