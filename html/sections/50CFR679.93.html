used to weigh total catch and the location where the observer collects species composition samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fish on deck. No fish are allowed to remain on deck unless an observer is present, except for fish inside the codend and fish accidentally spilled from the codend during hauling and dumping. Fish accidentally spilled from the codend must be moved to the fish bin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sample storage. There is sufficient space to accommodate a minimum of 10 observer sampling baskets. This space must be within or adjacent to the observer sample station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Pre-cruise meeting. The Observer Program Office is notified by phone at 1-907-271-1702 at least 24 hours prior to departure when the vessel will be carrying an observer who has not previously been deployed on that vessel within the last 12 months. Subsequent to the vessel's departure notification, but prior to departure, NMFS may contact the vessel to arrange for a pre-cruise meeting. The pre-cruise meeting must minimally include the vessel operator or manager, and any observers assigned to the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Belt and flow operations. The vessel operator stops the flow of fish and clears all belts between the bin doors and the area where the observer collects samples of unsorted catch when requested to do so by the observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Vessel crew in tanks or bins. The vessel owner or operator must comply with the bin monitoring standards specified in Sec. 679.28(i)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Catch monitoring requirements for Amendment 80 vessels fishing in the GOA.
