                            <p class="depth0">Entry of cottonseed cake and cottonseed meal will be authorized  through any port at which the services of an inspector are available,  subject to examination by an inspector for freedom from contamination.  If found to be free of contamination, importations of such cottonseed  cake and cottonseed meal will be released from further plant quarantine  entry restrictions. If found to be contaminated such importations will  be refused entry or subjected as a condition of entry to such safeguards   as the inspector may prescribe, according to a method selected by the  inspector from administratively authorized procedures known to be  effective under the conditions under which the safeguards are applied.
