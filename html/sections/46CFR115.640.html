                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct a pre-survey meeting to discuss the details of the AHE procedure with the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If you exclusively use divers to examine the underwater hull plating, the third party examiner must attend the meeting and you must present the results of the preliminary examination. If you use an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as the predominate means to examine the vessel's hull plating, then a representative of the ROV operating company must attend the pre-survey meeting and address the underwater ROV's capabilities and limitations related to your vessel's hull design and configuration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A vessel owner, operator, or designated agent must request this meeting in writing at least 30 days in advance of the examination date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The pre-survey meeting may be conducted by teleconference, if agreed to in advance by the OCMI.
