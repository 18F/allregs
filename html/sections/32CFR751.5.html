                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Proper claimants--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members of the DON. All Navy and Marine  Corps active duty members and reservists on active duty for training  under Federal law whether commissioned, enrolled, appointed, or  enlisted. A retired member may only claim under this Act if loss or  damage occurred while the claimant was on active duty or in connection  with the claimant's last movement of personal property incident to  service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civilian employees of the Navy. Federal employees of the naval  establishment paid from appropriated funds. This term does not include  Red Cross employees, USO personnel, and employees of Government  contractors (including technical representatives).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claims by non-appropriated fund employees. Claims by employees  of Navy and Marine Corps non-appropriated fund activities for loss,  damage, or destruction of personal property incident to their employment  will be processed and adjudicated in accordance with this part and  forwarded to the appropriate local non-appropriated fund activity that  employs the claimant for payment from non-appropriated funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Separation from service. Separation from the service or  termination of employment shall not bar former military personnel or  civilian employees from   filing claims or bar designated personnel from considering,  ascertaining, adjusting, determining, and authorizing payment of claims  otherwise falling within the provision of these regulations when such  claim accrued prior to separation or termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Agent or legal representative. The authorized agent or legal  representative of a proper claimant may file on behalf of the claimant  if the agent provides a power of attorney that complies with local law.  Certain relatives of a deceased proper claimant may file any claim the  claimant could have filed. The PCA identifies these relatives in order  of priority. If multiple persons who the statute lists as equals in  priority file separate claims, the first claim settled extinguishes the  rights of the other claimants. The estate of a deceased proper party  claimant is not a proper claimant, nor is an executor or personal  representative who cannot file as a survivor. The PCA ranks surviving  relatives in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spouse;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Child or children;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Father, mother, or both;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Brother, sister, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Improper claimants. Insurers, assignees, subrogees, vendors,  lienholders, contractors, subcontractors and their employees, and other  persons not specifically mentioned as proper claimants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unusual occurrence. Serious events and natural disaster not  expected to take place in the normal course of events and hazards  outside the normal risks of day-to-day living and working. Two different  types of incidents may be considered unusual occurrences: those of an  unusual nature and those of a common nature that occur to an unexpected  degree of severity. Examples of unusual occurrences include structural  defects in quarters, faulty plumbing maintenance, termite or rodent  damage, unusually large size hail, and hazardous health conditions due  to Government use of toxic chemicals. Examples of occurrences that are  not unusual include potholes or foreign objects in the road, ice and  snow sliding off a roof onto a vehicle, and tears, rips, snags, or  stains on clothing. Claims that electrical or electronic devices were  damaged by a power surge may be paid when lightning has actually struck  the claimant's residence or objects outside the residence, such as a  transformer box, or when power company records or similar evidence shows  that a particular residence or group of residences was subjected to a  power surge of unusual intensity. In areas subject to frequent  thunderstorms or power fluctuations, claimants are expected to use surge  suppressors, if available, to protect delicate items such as computers  or videocassette recorders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Personal property. Property including but not limited to  household goods, unaccompanied baggage, privately owned vehicles  (POV's), mobile homes, and boats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Intangible property. Property that has no intrinsic marketable  value such as bankbooks, checks, promissory notes, non-negotiable stock  certificates, bonds, baggage checks, insurance policies, money orders,  and travelers checks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vehicles. Include automobiles, motorcycles, mopeds, jet skis,  utility trailers, camping trailers, trucks, mounted camper bodies, motor  homes, boats, boat trailers, bicycles, and aircraft. Mobile homes and  other property used as dwelling places are not considered vehicles.  [57 FR 5055, Feb. 12, 1992, as amended at 72 FR 53422, Sept. 19, 2007]</p>
