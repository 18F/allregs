                            <p class="depth0">If you are dissatisfied with the initial determination,  reconsideration is the first step in the administrative review process  that we provide, except that we provide the opportunity for a hearing  before an administrative law judge as the first step for those  situations described in Secs. 404.930 (a)(6) and (a)(7), where you  appeal an initial determination denying your request for waiver of  adjustment or recovery of an overpayment (see Sec. 404.506). If you are  dissatisfied with our reconsidered determination, you may request a  hearing before an administrative law judge.  [61 FR 56132, Oct. 31, 1996]</p>
