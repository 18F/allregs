                                Sec. 600.340  Periodic redetermination and renewal of BHP eligibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Periodic review of eligibility. An individual is subject to  periodic review of eligibility every 12 months unless the eligibility is  redetermined sooner based on new information received and verified from  enrollee reports or data sources. The State must require enrollees to  report changes in circumstances, at least to the extent that they would  be required to report such changes if enrolled in coverage through the  Exchange, consistent with 45 CFR 155.330(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Renewal of coverage. If an enrollee remains eligible for  coverage in the BHP, the enrollee will be afforded notice of a  reasonable opportunity at least annually to change plans to the extent  the BHP offers a choice of plans, and shall remain in the plan selected  for the previous year unless such enrollee terminates coverage from the  plan by selecting a new plan or withdrawing from a plan, or the plan is  no longer available as a standard health plan in BHP. Enrollees in plans  that are no longer available will be given a reasonable opportunity to  select a new plan, and if they do not select a new plan will be enrolled  in another plan pursuant to a methodology set forth in the State's  Blueprint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures. The State shall choose to apply equally all the  redetermination procedures described in either 45 CFR 155.335 or 42 CFR  435.916(a) in administering a BHP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Verification. The State must verify information needed to  redetermine and renew eligibility in accordance with Sec. 600.345 and  comply with the requirements set forth in Sec. 600.330 relating to  screening individuals for other insurance affordability programs and  transmitting such individuals' electronic accounts and other relevant  information to the other program, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to enrollee. The State must provide an enrollee with an  annual notice of redetermination of eligibility. The annual notice  should include all current information used for the most recent  eligibility determination. The enrollee is required to report any  changes with respect to information listed within the notice within 30  days of the date of the notice. The State must verify information in  accordance with Sec. 600.345.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Continuous eligibility. The state is not required to redetermine  eligibility of BHP enrollees more frequently than every 12 months,  regardless of changes   of circumstances, as long as the enrollees are under age 65, are not  otherwise enrolled in minimum essential coverage and remain residents of  the State.</p>
