                            <p class="depth0">Section 1 of the Davis-Bacon Act (46 Stat. 1494, as amended; 40 U.S.C. 276a) provides for the inclusion of certain fringe benefits in the prevailing wages that are predetermined by the Secretary of Labor, under that Act and related statutes, as minimum wages for laborers and mechanics employed by

contractors and subcontractors performing construction activity on Federal and federally assisted projects. Laborers and mechanics performing work subject to such predetermined minimum wages may, if they work overtime, be subject to overtime compensation provisions of other laws which may apply concurrently to them, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. In view of this fact, specific provision was made in the Davis-Bacon Act for the treatment of such predetermined fringe benefits in the computation of overtime compensation under other applicable statutes including the Fair Labor Standards Act. The application of this provision is discussed in Sec. 5.32 of this title, which should be considered together with the interpretations in this part 778 in determining any overtime compensation payable under the Fair Labor Standards Act to such laborers and mechanics in any workweek when they are subject to fringe benefit wage determinations under the Davis-Bacon and related acts.</p>
