                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The distress alert must identify the station in distress and its  position. The distress alert may also contain information regarding the  nature of the distress, the type of assistance required, the course and  speed of the mobile unit, the time that this information was recorded  and any other information which might facilitate rescue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The format of distress calls and distress messages must be in  accordance with ITU-R M.493-13 and ITU-R M.541-9 (both incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 80.7), as specified in Sec. 80.1101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ship-to-shore distress alerts are used to alert Rescue  Coordination Centers via coast stations or coast earth stations that a  ship is in distress. These alerts are based on the use of transmissions  via satellites (from a ship earth station or a satellite EPIRB) and  terrestrial services (from ship stations and EPIRBs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in  the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital  selective calling in the VHF and MF bands. The HF bands should not be  used to notify ships in the vicinity unless no response is received  within five minutes on VHF or MF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shore-to-ship distress alert relays are used by a station or  Rescue Coordination Center to relay information about a ship in distress  to, as appropriate, all ships, a selected group of ships, or a specific  ship by satellite and/or terrestrial means. The distress alert relay  must contain the identification of the mobile unit in distress, its  position and all other information which might facilitate rescue.
