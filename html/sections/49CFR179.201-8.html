                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sampling valve and thermometer well are not specification  requirements. When used, they must be of approved design, made of metal  not subject to rapid deterioration by lading, and must withstand a  pressure of 100 psig without leakage. Interior pipes of the sampling  valve must be equipped with excess flow valves of an approved design.  Interior pipe of thermometer well must be closed by an approved   valve attached close to fitting where it passes through the tank and  closed by a screw plug. Other approved arrangements that permit testing  thermometer well for leaks without complete removal of the closure may  be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [Amdt. 179-10, 36 FR 21348, Nov. 6, 1971, as amended at 66 FR 45390,  Aug. 28, 2001]</p>
