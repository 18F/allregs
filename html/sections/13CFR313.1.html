The Community TAA Program is designed to assist Communities impacted by trade with economic adjustment through the coordination of Federal, State, and local resources, the creation of community-based development strategies, and the development and provision of programs that meet the training needs of workers. The statutory authority and responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce relating to Community TAA are

delegated to EDA. EDA certifies Communities as eligible to apply for assistance under the Community TAA Program, provides technical assistance to Impacted Communities, and provides implementation assistance to Impacted Communities in preparing and carrying out Strategic Plans.</p>
