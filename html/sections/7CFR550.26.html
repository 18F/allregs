                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cooperators are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of REE nonassistance awards using their established controls and policies, as long as they are consistent with REE requirements. However, in order to fulfill their role in regard to the stewardship of Federal funds, REE Agencies monitor their agreements to identify potential problems and areas where technical assistance might be necessary. This active monitoring is accomplished through review of reports and correspondence from the cooperator, audit reports, site visits, and other information available to the REE Agency. It is the responsibility of the Cooperator to ensure that the project is being performed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring of a project or activity will continue for as long as the REE Agency retains a financial interest in the project or activity. REE agencies reserve the right to monitor a project after it has been administratively closed out and no longer providing active support in order to resolve issues of accountability and other administrative requirements. Additional requirements regarding reporting and program performance can be found in Sec. Sec. 550.51 through 550.55 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The REE Agency reserves the right to perform site visits at Cooperator locations. Access to project or program records shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 550.55.</p>
