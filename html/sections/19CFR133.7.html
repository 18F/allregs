                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application to renew. To continue uninterrupted CBP protection  for trademarks, the trademark owner shall submit a written application  to renew CBP recordation to the IPR & Restricted Merchandise Branch not  later than 3 months after the date of expiration of the current 20-year  trademark registration issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A  timely application to renew a CBP recordation must include the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A status copy of the certificate of registration certified by  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office showing renewal of the trademark  and title to be in the name of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement describing any change of ownership or in the name of  owner, in compliance with Sec. Sec. 133.5 and 133.6 of this part, and  any change of addresses of owners or places of manufacture; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A fee of $80 for each renewal of a trademark recordation. Where  the trademark covers several classes, a fee of $80 is required for each  class. A check or money order shall be made payable to the U.S. Customs  and Border Protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delayed application. Upon request made during the grace period  of 3 months afforded by paragraph (a) of this section, a trademark owner  whose application for renewal of recordation is unavoidably delayed may  be afforded a reasonable extended period within   which to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.  The request shall be in writing, addressed to the IPR & Restricted  Merchandise Branch, and shall set forth the circumstances due to which  application is delayed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Untimely application. Failure of the trademark owner to submit a  renewal application within the 3-month grace period afforded in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or within an extension of  time granted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall  deprive the trademark owner of the renewal process. A delinquent  applicant will be required to apply anew to record the renewed trademark  in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Sec. Sec. 133.2  and 133.3.
