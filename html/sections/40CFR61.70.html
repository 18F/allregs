The first report is  to be submitted following the first full 3-month reporting period after  the initial report is submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an existing source, the approved reporting  schedule shall be used. In addition, quarterly reports shall be  submitted exactly 3 months following the current reporting dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an existing source or a new source which has  an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report  is to be submitted within 180 days of the effective date, unless a  waiver of compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11. If a waiver of  compliance is granted, the first report is to be submitted on a date  scheduled by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a new source which did not have an initial  startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be  submitted within 180 days of the initial startup date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section, unless an  alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the  Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained  by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method.  If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree,  the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the  Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the  method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (b), (c), or  (d), or during which average emissions are in excess of the emission  limits specified for any control system to which reactor emissions are  required to be ducted in Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions  are required to be ducted in Sec. 61.65(b)(I)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5),  (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii). The number of 3-hour periods for which  average emissions were determined during the reporting period shall be  reported. If emissions in excess of the emission limits are not  detected, the report shall contain a statement that no excess emissions  have been detected. The emissions are to be determined in accordance  with Sec. 61.68(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In polyvinyl chloride plants for which a stripping operation is  used to attain the emission level prescribed in Sec. 61.64(e), the owner  or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl chloride  content in the polyvinyl chloride resin.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If batch stripping is used, one representative sample of  polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken from each batch of each grade of  resin immediately following the completion of the stripping operation,  and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the batch  is completed. The corresponding quantity of material processed in each  stripper batch is to be recorded and identified by resin type and grade  and the date and time the batch is completed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If continuous stripping is used, one representative sample of  polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken for each grade of resin  processed or at intervals of 8 hours for each grade of resin which is  being processed, whichever is more frequent. The sample is to be taken  as the resin flows out of the stripper and identified by resin type and  grade and the date and time the sample was taken. The corresponding  quantity of material processed by each stripper over the time period  represented by the sample during the 8-hour period, is to   be recorded and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time  it represents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vinyl chloride content in each sample is to be determined  by Method 107 as prescribed in Sec. 61.67(g)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The report to the Administrator by the owner or operator is to  include a record of any 24-hour average resin vinyl chloride  concentration, as determined in this paragraph, in excess of the limits  prescribed in Sec. 61.64(e). The vinyl chloride content found in each  sample required by paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section  shall be averaged separately for each type of resin, over each calendar  day and weighted according to the quantity of each grade of resin  processed by the stripper(s) that calendar day, according to the  following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.481  Where:  AT = 24-hour average concentration of type T resin in ppm</p><p class="depth4">(dry weight basis). QT = Total production of type T resin over the 24-hour</p><p class="depth4">period, in kg (ton). T = Type of resin. MGi = Concentration of vinyl chloride in one sample of grade</p><p class="depth4">Gi resin in ppm. PGi = Production of grade Gi resin represented by</p><p class="depth4">the sample, in kg (ton). Gi = Grade of resin: e.g., G1, G2,</p><p class="depth4">G3. n = Total number of grades of resin produced during the 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth4">The number of 24-hour average concentrations for each resin type  determined during the reporting period shall be reported.

The records are to contain the  following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The vinyl chloride content found in all the samples required in  paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, identified by the  resin type and grade and the time and date of the sample, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The corresponding quantity of polyvinyl chloride resin processed  by the stripper(s), identified by the resin type and grade and the time  and date it represents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall include in the report a record of  any emissions from each reactor opening in excess of the emission limits  prescribed in Sec. 61.64(a)(2). Emissions are to be determined in  accordance with Sec. 61.67(g)(5), except that emissions for each reactor  are to be determined. The number of reactor openings during the  reporting period shall be reported. If emissions in excess of the  emission limits are not detected, the report shall include a statement  that excess emissions have not been detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In polyvinyl chloride plants for which stripping in the reactor  is used to attain the emission level prescribed in Sec. 61.64(f), the  owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl  chloride emissions from reactor opening loss and all sources following  the reactor used as a stripper.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One representative sample of polyvinyl chloride resin is to be  taken from each batch of each grade of resin immediately following the  completion of the stripping operation, and identified by resin type and  grade and the date and time the batch is completed.

The combined reactor opening loss and emissions from all  sources following the reactor used as a stripper associated with each  batch are to be averaged separately for each type of resin, over each  calendar day and weighted according to the quantity of each grade of  resin stripped in reactors that calendar day as follows:</p><p class="depth4">For each type of resin (suspension, dispersion, latex, bulk, other),  the following calculation is to be performed: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.482  Where:  AT = 24-hour average combined reactor opening loss and</p><p class="depth4">emissions from all sources following the reactor used as a</p><p class="depth4">stripper, in g vinyl chloride/kg (lb/ton) product (dry weight</p><p class="depth4">basis).
