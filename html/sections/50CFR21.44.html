Take of birds under this order must be done under the supervision of the county agriculture commissioner. You do not need a Federal permit for this depredation control as long as you meet the conditions below, but a depredation permit (see Sec.  21.41 in this subpart) is required for take of other migratory bird species, or for take of horned larks or white-crowned sparrows from May 1 through October 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When is take allowed under this depredation order?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horned larks and white-crowned sparrows may be controlled from November 1 through April 30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> House finches may be controlled at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of nonlethal control. Each season, before lethal control may be undertaken, the landowner must attempt to use nonlethal control of migratory bird depredation as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services. The county agriculture commissioner must confirm that nonlethal measures have been undertaken to control or eliminate the problem prior to the landowner using lethal control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ammunition. Except when using an air rifle or an air pistol, if firearms are used to kill migratory birds under the provisions of this regulation, the shooter must use nontoxic shot or nontoxic bullets to do so. See Sec.  20.21(j) of this chapter for a listing of approved nontoxic shot types.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition of carcasses. Specimens useful for scientific purposes may be transferred to any entity authorized to possess them.

None of the above migratory birds killed, or the parts thereof, or the plumage of such birds, may be sold or removed from the area where killed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual report. Any county official acting under this depredation order must provide an annual report to the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office using FWS Form 3-202-20-2144.
