discharge data for the facility) multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based on the maximum relief valve setting or maximum system pressure when relief valves are not provided) plus the total line drainage volume expressed in barrels for the pipe between the marine manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For a mobile facility it means the loss of the entire contents of the container in which the oil is stored or transported.</p>
