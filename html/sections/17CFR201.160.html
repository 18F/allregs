                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or  allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the  day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of  time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so  computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal  legal holiday (as defined in Sec. 201.104), in which event the period  runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or  Federal   legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal  holidays shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time  prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any  additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this  section. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other  conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing  location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of  the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal  holiday.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional time for service by mail. If service is made by mail,  three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response unless  an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date  certain for filing. In the event that an order of the Commission or the  hearing officer specifies a date certain for filing, no time shall be  added for service by mail.
