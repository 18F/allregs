Sec. 9904.418-10  [Reserved]


Sec. 9904.418-20  Purpose.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to provide for consistent determination of direct and indirect costs; to provide criteria for the accumulation of indirect costs, including service center and overhead costs, in indirect cost pools; and, to provide guidance relating to the selection of allocation measures based on the beneficial or causal relationship between an indirect cost pool and cost objectives. Consistent application of these criteria and guidance will improve classification of costs as direct and indirect and the allocation of indirect costs.


Sec. 9904.418-30  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in this

Standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph (b) of this subsection, requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocate means to assign an item of cost, or a group of items of cost, to one or more cost objectives. This term includes both direct assignment of cost and the reassignment of a share from an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Direct cost means any cost which is identified specifically with a particular final cost objective. Direct costs are not limited to items which are incorporated in the end product as material or labor. Costs identified specifically with a contract are direct costs of that contract. All costs identified specifically with other final cost objectives of the contractor are direct costs of those cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect cost means any cost not directly identified with a single final cost objective, but identified with two or more final cost objectives or with at least one intermediate cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indirect cost pool means a grouping of incurred costs identified with two or more cost objectives but not identified specifically with any final cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.


Sec. 9904.418-40  Fundamental requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A business unit shall have a written statement of accounting policies and practices for classifying costs as direct or indirect which shall be consistently applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect costs shall be accumulated in indirect cost pools which are homogeneous.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pooled costs shall be allocated to cost objectives in reasonable proportion to the beneficial or causal relationship of the pooled costs to cost objectives as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a material amount of the costs included in a cost pool are costs of management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct material costs, resource consumption cannot be specifically identified with cost objectives. In that circumstance, a base shall be used which is representative of the activity being managed or supervised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the cost pool does not contain a material amount of the costs of management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct material costs, resource consumption can be specifically identified with cost objectives. The pooled cost shall be allocated based on the specific identifiability of resource consumption with cost objectives by means of one of the following allocation bases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A resource consumption measure,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An output measure, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A surrogate that is representative of resources consumed.
The base shall be selected in accordance with the criteria set out in 9904.418-50(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> To the extent that any cost allocations are required by the provisions of other Cost Accounting Standards, such allocations are not subject to the provisions of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> This Standard does not cover accounting for the costs of special facilities where such costs are accounted for in separate indirect cost pools.


Sec. 9904.418-50  Techniques for application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of direct cost and indirect cost. (1) The business unit's written policy classifying costs as direct or indirect shall be in conformity with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In accounting for direct costs a business unit shall use actual costs, except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Standard costs for material and labor may be used as provided in 9904.407; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An average cost or pre-established rate for labor may be used provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The functions performed are not materially disparate and employees involved are interchangeable with respect to the functions performed, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The functions performed are materially disparate but the employees involved either all work in a single production unit yielding homogeneous outputs, or perform their respective functions as an integral team.
Whenever average cost or pre-established rates for labor are used, the

variances, if material, shall be disposed of at least annually by allocation to cost objectives in proportion to the costs previously allocated to these cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labor or material costs identified specifically with one of the particular cost objectives listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection shall be accounted for as direct labor or direct material costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Homogeneous indirect cost pools. (1) An indirect cost pool is homogeneous if each significant activity whose costs are included therein has the same or a similar beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives as the other activities whose costs are included in the cost pool. It is also homogeneous if the allocation of the costs of the activities included in the cost pool result in an allocation to cost objectives which is not materially different from the allocation that would result if the costs of the activities were allocated separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An indirect cost pool is not homogeneous if the costs of all significant activities in the cost pool do not have the same or a similar beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives and, if the costs were allocated separately, the resulting allocation would be materially different. The determination of materiality shall be made using the criteria provided in 9903.305.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A homogeneous indirect cost pool shall include all indirect costs identified with the activity to which the pool relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Change in allocation base. No change in an existing indirect cost pool allocation base is required if the allocation resulting from the existing base does not differ materially from the allocation that results from the use of the base determined to be most appropriate in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection. The determination of materiality shall be made using the criteria provided in Subpart 9903.305.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation measures for an indirect cost pool which includes a material amount of the costs of management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct material costs. (1) The costs of the management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct material costs do not have a direct and definitive relationship to the benefiting cost objectives and cannot be allocated on measures of a specific beneficial or causal relationship. In that circumstance, the base selected to measure the allocation of the pooled costs to cost objectives shall be a base representative of the activity being managed or supervised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The base used to represent the activity being managed or supervised shall be determined by the application of the criteria below. All significant elements of the selected base shall be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A direct labor hour base or direct labor cost base shall be used, whichever in the aggregate is more likely to vary in proportion to the costs included in the cost pool being allocated, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A machine-hour base is appropriate if the costs in the cost pool are comprised predominantly of facility-related costs, such as depreciation, maintenance, and utilities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A units-of-production base is appropriate if there is common production of comparable units; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A material cost base is appropriate if the activity being managed or supervised is a material-related activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect cost pools which include material amounts of the costs of management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct material costs shall be allocated to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Final cost objectives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Goods produced for stock or product inventory;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Independent research and development and bid and proposal projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cost centers used to accumulate costs identified with a process cost system (i.e., process cost centers);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Goods or services produced or acquired for other segments of the contractor and for other cost objectives of a business unit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Self-construction, fabrication, betterment, improvement, or installation of tangible capital assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allocation measures for indirect cost pools that do not include material amounts of the costs of management or supervision of activities involving direct

labor or direct material costs. Homogeneous indirect cost pools of this type have a direct and definitive relationship between the activities in the pool and benefiting cost objectives. The pooled costs shall be allocated using an appropriate measure of resource consumption. This determination shall be made in accordance with the following criteria taking into consideration the individual circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The best representation of the beneficial or causal relationship between an indirect cost pool and the benefiting cost objectives is a measure of resource consumption of the activities of the indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> If consumption measures are unavailable or impractical to ascertain, the next best representation of the beneficial or causal relationship for allocation is a measure of the output of the activities of the indirect cost pool. Thus, the output is substituted for a direct measure of the consumption of resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If consumption measures are unavailable or impractical to ascertain, the next best representation of the beneficial or causal relationship for allocation is a measure of the output of the activities of the indirect cost pool. Thus, the output is substituted for a direct measure of the consumption of resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of the basic unit of output will not reflect the proportional consumption of resources in circumstances in which the level of resource consumption varies among the units of output produced. Where a material difference will result, either the output measure shall be modified or more than one output measure shall be used to reflect the resources consumed to perform the activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If neither resources consumed nor output of the activities can be measured practically, a surrogate that varies in proportion to the services received shall be used to measure the resources consumed. Generally, such surrogates measure the activity of the cost objectives receiving the service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of indirect cost pools which benefit one another may be accomplished by use of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cross-allocation (reciprocal) method,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sequential method, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Another method the results of which approximate those achieved by either of the methods in subdivisions (e)(4)(i) or (e)(4)(ii) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the activities represented by an indirect cost pool provide services to two or more cost objectives simultaneously, the cost of such services shall be prorated between or among the cost objectives in reasonable proportion to the beneficial or causal relationship between the services and the cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special allocation. Where a particular cost objective in relation to other cost objectives receives significantly more or less benefit from an indirect cost pool than would be reflected by the allocation of such costs using a base determined pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection, the Government and contractor may agree to a special allocation from that indirect cost pool to the particular cost objective commensurate with the benefits received. The amount of a special allocation to any such cost objective made pursuant to such an agreement shall be excluded from the indirect cost pool and the particular cost objective's allocation base data shall be excluded from the base used to allocate the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Use of preestablished rates for indirect costs. (1) Preestablished rates, based on either forecasted actual or standard cost, may be used in allocating an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preestablished rates shall reflect the costs and activities anticipated for the cost accounting period except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this subsection. Such preestablished rates shall be reviewed at least annually, and revised as necessary to reflect the anticipated conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contracting parties may agree on preestablished rates which are not based on costs and activities anticipated for a cost accounting period. The contractor shall have and consistently apply written policies for the establishment of these rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Under paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this subsection where variances of a cost accounting period are material, these variances shall be disposed of by allocating them to cost objectives in proportion to the costs previously allocated to these cost objectives by use of the preestablished rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If preestablished rates are revised during a cost accounting period and if the variances accumulated to the time of the revision are significant, the costs allocated to that time shall be adjusted to the amounts which would

have been allocated using the revised preestablished rates.


Sec. 9904.418-60  Illustrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Business Unit A has various classifications of engineers whose time is spent in working directly on the production of the goods or services called for by contracts and other final cost objectives. In keeping with its written policy, detailed time records are kept of the hours worked by these engineers, showing the job/account numbers representing various cost objectives. On the basis of these detailed time records, Unit A allocates the labor costs of these engineers as direct labor costs of final cost objectives. This practice is in accordance with the requirements of 9904.418-50(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Business Unit B has a fabrication department, employees of which perform various functions on units of the work-in-process of multiple final cost objectives. These employees are grouped by labor skills and are interchangeable within the skill grouping. The average wage rate for each group is multiplied by the hours worked on each cost objective by employees in that group. The contractor classifies these costs as direct labor costs of each final cost objective. This cost accounting treatment is in accordance with the provisions of 9904.418-50(a)(2)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Business Unit C accumulates the costs relating to building ownership, maintenance, and utility into one indirect cost pool designated ``Occupancy Costs'' for allocation to cost objectives. Each of these activities has the same or a similar beneficial or causal relationship to the cost objectives occupying a space. Unit C's practice is in conformance with the provisions of 9904.418-50(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Business Unit D includes the indirect costs of machining and assembling activities in a single manufacturing overhead pool. The machining activity does not have the same or similar beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives as the assembling activity. Also, the allocation of the cost of the machining activity to cost objectives would be significantly different if allocated separately from the cost of the assembling activity. Unit D's single manufacturing overhead pool is not homogeneous in accordance with the provisions of 9904.418-50(b), and separate pools must be established in accordance with 9904.418-40(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In accordance with 9904.418-50(b)(3), Business Unit E includes all the cost of occupancy in an indirect cost pool. In selecting an allocation measure for this indirect cost pool, the contractor establishes that it is impractical to ascertain a measurement of the consumption of resources in relation to the use of facilities by individual cost objectives. An output base, the number of square feet of space provided to users, can be measured practically; however, the cost to provide facilities is significantly different for various types of facilities such as warehouse, factory, and office and each type of facility requires a different level of resource consumption to provide the same number of square feet of usable space. Allocation on a basic unit measure of square feet of space occupied will not adequately reflect the proportional consumption of resources. Unit E establishes a weighted square foot measure for allocating occupancy costs, which reflects the different levels of resource consumption required to provide the different types of facilities. This practice is in conformance with provisions of 9904.418-50(e)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Business Unit F has an indirect cost pool containing a significant amount of material-related costs. The contractor allocates these costs between his machining overhead cost pool and his assembly overhead cost pool. The business unit finds it impractical to use an allocation measure based on either consumption or output. The business unit selects a dollars of material-issued base which varies in proportion to the services rendered. The dollars of material-issued base is a surrogate base which conforms to the provisions of 9904.418-50(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Business Unit G has a machining activity for which it develops a separate overhead rate, using direct labor cost as the allocation base. The machining activity occasionally does significant amounts of work for other activities of the business unit. The labor used in doing the work for other activities is of the same nature as that used

for contract work. However, the machining labor for other activities is not included in the base used to allocate the overhead costs of the machining activity. This practice is not in conformance with 9904.418-50(d)(2). Unit G must include the cost of labor doing work for the other activities in the allocation base for the machining activity indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Business Unit H accounts for the costs of company aircraft in a separate homogeneous indirect cost pool and allocates the cost to benefiting cost objectives using flight hours. Unit H prorates the cost of a single flight between benefiting cost objectives whenever simultaneous services have been rendered. Manager of Contract 2 learns of the trip and goes along with Manager of Contract 1. Unit H prorates the cost of the trip between Contract 1 and Contract 2. This practice is in conformance with the provision of 9904.418-50(e)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During a cost accounting period, Business Unit I allocates the cost of its flight services indirect cost pool to other indirect cost pools and final cost objectives using a preestablished rate. The preestablished rate is based on an estimate of the actual costs and activity for the cost accounting period. For the cost accounting period, Unit I establishes a rate of $200 per hour for use of the flight services activity. In March, the contractor's operating environment changes significantly; the contractor now expects a significant increase in the cost of this activity during the remainder of the year. Unit I estimates the rate for the entire cost accounting period to be $240 an hour. Pursuant to the provisions of 9904.418-50(g)(4), the Business Unit may revise its rate to the expected $240 an hour. If the accumulated variances are significant, the business unit must also adjust the costs previously allocated to reflect the revised rates.
