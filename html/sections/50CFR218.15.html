                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring measures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard watch personnel. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ships  operated by or for the Navy must have personnel assigned to stand watch  at all times, day and night, when moving through the water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Watch personnel must undertake extensive training in accordance  with the U.S. Navy Lookout Training Handbook or civilian equivalent,  including on-the-job instruction and a formal Personal Qualification  Standard program (or equivalent program for supporting contractors or  civilians), to certify that they have demonstrated all necessary skills  (such as detection and reporting of floating or partially submerged  objects).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> While on watch, watch personnel must employ visual search  techniques, including the use of binoculars, using a scanning method in  accordance with the U.S. Navy Lookout Training Handbook or civilian  equivalent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> After sunset and prior to sunrise, watch personnel must employ  night visual search techniques, which could include the use of night  vision devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A primary duty of watch personnel is to detect and report all  objects and disturbances sighted in the water that may be indicative of  a threat to the ship and its crew, such as debris, a periscope, surfaced  submarine, or surface disturbance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Per safety requirements, watch personnel also report any marine  mammals sighted that have the potential to be in the direct path of the  ship as a standard collision avoidance procedure. Because watch  personnel are primarily posted for safety of navigation, range  clearance, and man-overboard precautions, they are not normally posted  while ships are moored to a pier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> When anchored or moored to a buoy, a watch team is still  maintained but with fewer personnel than when underway.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> When moored or at anchor, watch personnel may maintain  security and safety of the ship by scanning the water for any  indications of a threat.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> While underway, Navy ships (with the exception of submarines)  greater than 65 ft. (20 m) in length have at least two watch personnel;  Navy ships less than 65 ft. (20 m) in length, surfaced submarines, and  contractor ships have at least one watch person. While underway, watch  personnel are alert at all times and have access to binoculars. Due to  limited manning and space limitations, small boats and some craft  transferring cargo from ship to shore do not have dedicated watch  personnel, and the boat crew is responsible for maintaining the safety  of the boat and surrounding environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> All vessels use extreme caution and proceed at a ``safe speed''  so they can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with  any sighted object or disturbance and can be stopped within a distance  appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lookouts. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lookouts must perform similar duties to standard  watch personnel, and are also responsible for satisfying mitigation  requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Navy must have one Lookout positioned on the platform  (which could include a small boat, the elevated causeway, or the shore)  that must maximize the potential for sightings during pile driving and  pile removal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Lookout positioned on the elevated causeway or the shore  must be dedicated solely to diligent observation of the air and surface  of the water. They must have multiple observation objectives, which  include but are not limited to detecting the presence of biological  resources and recreational or fishing boats, observing the mitigation  zone, and monitoring for equipment and personnel safety concerns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A Lookout positioned on a small boat may include a member of  the boat crew, and may be responsible for tasks in addition to observing  the air or surface of the water (e.g., navigation of a rigid hull  inflatable boat). However, a boat Lookout must, to the maximum extent  practicable and consistent with safety and training requirements, comply  with the observation objectives described above for a Lookout positioned  on the elevated causeway or the shore.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Lookouts must also perform visual observation starting 30  minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes after the exercise within a  mitigation zone of 60 yards (55 m) around the pile being driven.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Integrated comprehensive monitoring program. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Navy must  use the existing Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) and  its new ``study-based'' approach.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting measures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General notification of injured or dead  marine mammals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Navy personnel must ensure that NMFS (regional  stranding coordinator) is notified immediately (or as soon as clearance  procedures allow) if an injured or dead marine mammal is found during or  shortly after, and in the vicinity of, any Navy training exercise.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Navy must provide NMFS with species identification or  description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including  carcass condition if the animal is dead), location,   time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photographs  or video (if available).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual monitoring and exercise report. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reports from  individual monitoring events, results of analyses, publications, and  periodic progress reports for specific monitoring projects must be  posted to the Navy's Marine Species Monitoring web portal as they become  available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Progress and results from all monitoring activity conducted  within the JLOTS training area must be summarized in an annual report.  This report must detail the monitoring protocol, summarize the data  recorded during monitoring, and estimate the number of marine mammals  that may have been harassed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Draft reports should be combined with the Navy's Atlantic  Fleet Training and Testing exercise and monitoring reports and submitted  to NMFS for review by February 13 (for exercises) and April 1 (for  monitoring) each year. NMFS will review the report and provide comments  for incorporation within 3 months.</p>
