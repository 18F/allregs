In FFY 3, the LEA applies but is ineligible for section 8003(b)(2). However, it will still receive a payment under section 8003(b)(2) for FFY 3 (a ``hold harmless'' payment under Sec. 222.66(a)). For FFY 4, the LEA applies and meets the requirements. The LEA is not eligible to receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment in FFY 4 but is instead eligible for a section 8003(b)(1) payment (see Sec. 222.66(b)). In FFY 5, the LEA applies, meets the requirements, and receives a section 8003(b)(2) payment. The LEA not only must apply one year in advance and meet the section 8003(b)(2) requirements (FFY 4) but it must apply and meet the requirements for the subsequent FFY (year 5). The effects of these requirements on a continuing applicant's status and payments are summarized in the table below.</p><p class="depth0">Continuing LEAs--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>...............  (b)(2)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A new heavily impacted LEA may resume eligibility for a heavily impacted payment if it meets the eligibility requirements in Sec. 222.64 for the fiscal year for which it seeks a payment.</p><p class="depth0">Example:</p><p class="depth0">NEW LEA</p><p class="depth0">A new LEA applies for a section 8003(b)(2) payment and meets the applicable eligibility criteria. The LEA does not receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment in FFY 1 and it must apply and meet the requirements again in FFY 2 before it can receive a (b)(2) payment (see Sec. 222.62(b)). If that new district is then ineligible for a year, it can regain eligibility only if it meets the applicable criteria in a subsequent year. For example, if a new LEA loses its section 8003(b)(2) eligibility in FFY 3 because its tax rate dropped to 94 percent of the average tax rate of comparable districts in the State, that LEA is still entitled to receive a payment under section 8003(b)(2) in FFY 3 if it applies for such payment (a ``hold harmless'' payment under Sec. 222.66(a)). Then if the LEA applies in FFY 4 and meets the eligibility requirement under section 8003(b)(2), it is once again eligible to receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment (see Sec. 222.66(c)). The effects of these requirements on a new applicant's status and payments are summarized in the table below.</p><p class="depth0">New LEAs--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">FFY 1                   FFY 2                  FFY 3                  FFY 4                  FFY 5--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8003(b)(2) Eligibility.............
