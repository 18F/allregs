Section 402.2 provides that a government securities broker or dealer must meet the applicable minimum dollar liquid capital requirement and that the firm's ratio of liquid capital to risk (total haircuts) must be at least 1.2:1; liquid capital must exceed risk by at least 20 percent. Total haircuts is the risk measure used in the ratio; it is made up of measures of market risk and measures of credit risk. The market risk of a government securities broker's or dealer's positions is accounted for

through the Treasury market risk haircut and the other securities haircut. Credit risk is accounted for in the counterparty exposure, concentration of credit, and credit volatility haircuts and in the computation of liquid capital through the various deductions and charges.</p><p class="depth0">Only positions in Treasury market risk instruments and financings may be used in the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut. Treasury market risk instruments and financings are described in 17 CFR 402.2 and in the instructions to the schedule where they are to be first entered. All other types of financial instruments are to be included in the calculation of the other securities haircut. Calculation of the other securities haircut is based on the SEC's Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1).</p><p class="depth0">Treasury market risk instruments may be excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut if they are included in the calculation of the other securities haircut as part of a hedge against long and short positions in securities, futures contracts, forward contracts, or options that are not Treasury market risk instruments. Only the portion of the total position in a Treasury market risk instrument that forms part of such a hedge may be excluded, and the result of this transfer of the Treasury market risk instruments must be a reduction in the other securities haircut.</p><p class="depth0">The categories for classifying Treasury market risk instruments are designated in 17 CFR 402.2(f)(1). The categories, which are designated by a maturity range, contain all securities with remaining terms to maturity greater than or equal to the lower end of the range but less than the higher. A half year is always considered to be 6 months. In categories A through D, zero-coupon instruments are to be treated in the same manner as all other instruments. In categories E through J, the maturity designations in parentheses give the maturities of the zero-coupon instruments to be placed in that category. All mortgage-backed securities that are Treasury market risk instruments are to be placed in category MB or category AR, depending on whether they are backed by conventional or adjustable-rate mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">All haircuts may be calculated to the nearest hundred dollars, unless such rounding would materially affect the liquid capital calculation.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to the Preamble published with the temporary regulations for 17 CFR part 402 (52 FR 19669, May 26, 1987) contains an example of the capital calculation.

The term to maturity of the underlying instrument is the term to maturity of the deliverable security at the time of the maturity of the futures or forward contract. The haircut on a futures or forward position on a non-mortgaged-backed instrument is to be entered in the category corresponding to the sum of the remaining time to maturity of the futures or forward contract and the maturity of the underlying instrument.

Note that in the case of an option on a futures contract the category in which the option contract is to be entered is the sum of the remaining time to maturity of the futures or forward contract and the maturity of the instrument underlying the futures or forward contract.

Netting the residual position interim haircuts reflects the risk reduction inherent in hedges between positions in different categories where the price volatility is reasonably well correlated.</p><p class="depth0">Section 402.2(f)(3) of the rule specifies the hedging disallowance haircut factors for the category pairs. Netting of residual position interim haircuts is permitted only between any two categories for which a hedging disallowance haircut factor is specified.

A hedging disallowance haircut is determined each time two residual position interim haircuts are netted.</p><p class="depth0">There are three levels of permissible netting corresponding to the three hedging disallowance haircut factors: The 20 percent, 30 percent, and 40 percent levels. It is not necessary to net all possible pairs at any one level. A greater reduction in total haircuts can sometimes be obtained by choosing not to net a pair at one level (e.g., the 20 percent level) so that one element of the pair can be netted against a third category at another level (e.g., the 30 percent level).</p><p class="depth0">Column 20--Transfer column 20, ``Residual Position Interim Haircuts,'' from Schedule D.
