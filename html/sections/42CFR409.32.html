                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be considered a skilled service, the service must be so inherently complex that it can be safely and effectively performed only by, or under the

supervision of, professional or technical personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A condition that does not ordinarily require skilled services may require them because of special medical complications. Under those circumstances, a service that is usually nonskilled (such as those listed in Sec. 409.33(d)) may be considered skilled because it must be performed or supervised by skilled nursing or rehabilitation personnel. For example, a plaster cast on a leg does not usually require skilled care. However, if the patient has a preexisting acute skin condition or needs traction, skilled personnel may be needed to adjust traction or watch for complications. In situations of this type, the complications, and the skilled services they require, must be documented by physicians' orders and nursing or therapy notes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The restoration potential of a patient is not the deciding factor in determining whether skilled services are needed. Even if full recovery or medical improvement is not possible, a patient may need skilled services to prevent further deterioration or preserve current capabilities. For example, a terminal cancer patient may need some of the skilled services described in Sec. 409.33.
