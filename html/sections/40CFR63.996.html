If both such CPMS's are used  during a particular reporting period to meet the monitoring requirements  of this subpart, then the owner or operator shall report the results  from each CPMS for the time during the six month period that the  instrument was relied upon to demonstrate compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operation and maintenance of continuous parameter monitoring  systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated,  maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or  other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the  equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a regulated source shall maintain and  operate each CPMS as specified in this section, or in a relevant  subpart, and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control  practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of a regulated source shall ensure the  immediate repair or replacement of CPMS parts to correct ``routine'' or  otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions.

Verification of operational status  shall, at a minimum, include completion of the manufacturer's written  specifications or recommendations for installation, operation, and  calibration of the system or other written procedures that provide  adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to  monitor accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All CPMS's shall be installed such that representative  measurements of parameters from the regulated source are obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In accordance with the referencing subpart, except for system  breakdowns, repairs, maintenance periods, instrument adjustments, or  checks to maintain precision and accuracy, calibration checks, and zero  and span adjustments, all continuous parameter monitoring systems shall  be in continuous operation when emissions are being routed to the  monitored device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator shall establish a range for monitored  parameters that indicates proper operation of the control or recovery  device. In order to establish the range, the information required in  Sec.  63.999(b)(3) shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance  Status or the operating permit application or amendment. The range may  be based upon a prior performance test meeting the specifications of  Sec.  63.997(b)(1) or a prior TRE index value determination, as  applicable, or upon existing ranges or limits established under a  referencing subpart. Where the regeneration stream flow and carbon bed  temperature are monitored, the range shall be in terms of the total  regeneration stream flow per regeneration cycle and the temperature of  the carbon bed determined within 15 minutes of the completion of the  regeneration cooling cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p>
