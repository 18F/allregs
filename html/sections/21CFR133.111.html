                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), and (d). It is cured for  not less than 90 days at a temperature of not less than 35 F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Milk, which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which  may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid- producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Harmless  artificial blue or green coloring in a quantity which neutralizes any  natural yellow coloring in the curd may be added. Sufficient rennet,  rennet paste, extract of rennet paste, or other safe and suitable milk- clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, singly or in  any combination (with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity  not more than 0.02 percent, calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride, of  the weight of the milk) is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass.  The mass is cut, stirred, and heated so as to promote and regulate the  separation of   whey from curd. The whey is drained off, and the curd is removed to  another vat containing hot whey, in which it is soaked for several  hours. This whey is withdrawn, the curd is allowed to mat, and is cut  into blocks. These are washed in hot whey until the desired elasticity  is obtained. The curd is removed from the vat, drained, pressed into  oblong forms, dried, and salted in brine, and cured. It may be  paraffined. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin  capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of caciocavallo  siciliano cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity  that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1  percent of the weight of the milk used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of this section, the word ``milk'' means  cow's milk or goat's milk or sheep's milk or mixtures of two or all of  these. Such milk may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom  or (in the case of cow's milk) by adding one or more of the following:  Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk; (in the case  of goat's milk) the corresponding products from goat's milk; (in the  case of sheep's milk) the corresponding products from sheep's milk;  water in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any such concentrated or  dried products used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such milk may be bleached by the use of benzoyl peroxide or a  mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and  magnesium carbonate; but the weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more  than 0.002 percent of the weight of the milk bleached, and the weight of  the potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or  combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide  used. If milk is bleached in this manner, sufficient vitamin A is added  to the curd to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors destroyed  in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safe and suitable antimycotic agent(s), the cumulative levels of  which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be added  to the cheese during the kneading and stretching process and/or applied  to the surface of the cheese.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When caciocavallo siciliano cheese is made solely from cow's  milk, the name of such cheese is ``Caciocavallo siciliano cheese''. When  made from sheep's milk or goat's milk or mixtures of these, or one or  both of these with cow's milk, the name is followed by the words ``made  from ------'', the blank being filled in with the name or names of the  milks used, in order of predominance by weight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that enzymes of animal, plant,  or microbial origin may be declared as ``enzymes''.
