                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the US-JFTA, a good must be imported directly from Jordan into the customs territory of the United States. For purposes of this requirement, the words ``imported directly'' mean:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct shipment from Jordan to the United States without passing through the territory of any intermediate country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If shipment is from Jordan to the United States through the territory of an intermediate country, the goods in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If shipment is through an intermediate country and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the goods in the shipment are imported directly only if they:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remained under the control of the customs authority in the intermediate country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of a sale other than at retail, provided that the goods are imported as a result of the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Have not been subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the goods in good condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentary evidence. An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment under the US-JFTA may be required to demonstrate, to CBP's satisfaction, that the goods were ``imported directly'' as that term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section. An importer may demonstrate compliance with this section by submitting documentary evidence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bills of lading, airway bills, packing lists, commercial invoices, receiving and inventory records, and customs entry and exit documents.</p><p class="depth2">Origin Verifications</p>
