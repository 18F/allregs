                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The Shorebased IFQ Program applies to qualified  participants in the Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery and includes a  system of transferable QS for most groundfish species or species groups,  IBQ for Pacific halibut, and trip limits or set-asides for the remaining  groundfish species or species groups. NMFS will issue a QS permit to  eligible participants and will establish a QS account for each QS permit  owner to track the amount of QS or IBQ and QP or IBQ pounds owned by  that owner. QS permit owners may own QS or IBQ for IFQ species,  expressed as a percent of the allocation to the Shorebased IFQ Program  for that species. NMFS will issue QP or IBQ pounds to QS permit owners,  expressed in pounds, on an annual basis, to be deposited in the  corresponding QS account. NMFS will establish a vessel account for each  eligible vessel owner participating in the Shorebased IFQ Program, which  is independent of the QS permit and QS account. In order to use QP or  IBQ pounds, a QS permit owner must transfer the QP or IBQ pounds from  the QS account into the vessel account for the vessel to which the QP or  IBQ pounds is to be assigned. Harvests of IFQ species may only be  delivered to an IFQ first receiver with a first receiver site license.  In addition to the requirements of this section, the Shorebased IFQ  Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations of subparts C  and D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C:  Sec. 660.11 Definitions, Sec. 660.12 Prohibitions, Sec. 660.13  Recordkeeping and reporting, Sec. 660.14 VMS requirements, Sec. 660.15  Equipment requirements, Sec. 660.16 Groundfish observer program, Sec.  660.20 Vessel and gear identification, Sec. 660.25 Permits, Sec.  660.55 Allocations, Sec. 660.60 Specifications and management measures,  Sec. 660.65 Groundfish harvest specifications, and Sec.

(1) IFQ species.  IFQ species are those groundfish species and Pacific halibut in the  exclusive economic zone or adjacent state waters off Washington, Oregon  and California, under the jurisdiction of the Council, for which QS and  IBQ are issued. Groupings and area subdivisions for IFQ species are  those groupings and area subdivisions for which ACLs or ACTs are  specified in the Tables 1a through 2d, and those for which there is an  area-specific precautionary harvest policy. The lists of individual  groundfish species included in the minor shelf complex north of  40[deg]10[min] N. lat., minor shelf complex south of 40[deg]10[min] N.  lat., minor slope complex north 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., minor slope  complex south of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., and in the other flatfish  complex are specified under the   definition of ``groundfish'' at Sec. 660.11.

A vessel participating in the Shorebased  IFQ Program may not fish in more than one IFQ management area during a  trip. IFQ management areas are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Between the US/Canada border and 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Between 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. and 36[deg] N. lat.,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Between 36[deg] N. lat. and 34[deg]27[min] N. lat., and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Between 34[deg]27[min] N. lat. and the US/Mexico border.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IFQ program allocations. Allocations for the Shorebased IFQ  Program are determined for IFQ species as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em>, subpart C, 42 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For Sablefish N. of 36[deg] N. lat., the Shorebased IFQ Program  allocation is the limited entry trawl allocation specified at Sec.  660.55(h), subpart C, minus any set-asides for the mothership and C/P  sectors for that species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For IFQ species listed in the trawl/nontrawl allocation table,  specified at Sec. 660.55(c), subpart C, allocations are determined by  applying the trawl column percent to the fishery harvest guideline minus  any set-asides for the mothership and C/P sectors for that species and  minus allocations for darkblotched rockfish, POP, and widow rockfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The remaining IFQ species (canary rockfish, bocaccio, cowcod,  yelloweye rockfish, minor shelf rockfish N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.,  and minor shelf rockfish S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., and minor slope  rockfish S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.) are allocated through the  biennial specifications and management measures process minus any set- asides for the mothership and C/P sectors for that species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For Pacific halibut N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., the Shorebased  IFQ Program allocation is specified at 660.55(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For each IFQ species, NMFS will determine annual sub- allocations to individual QS accounts by multiplying the percent of QS  or IBQ registered to the account by the amount of each respective IFQ  species allocated to the Shorebased IFQ Program for that year. For each  IFQ species, NMFS will deposit QP or IBQ pounds in the respective QS  account in the amount of each sub-allocation determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Reallocations--(A) Reallocation with changes in management  areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Area subdivision. If at any time after the initial allocation,  an IFQ species is geographically subdivided, those holding QS or IBQ for  the IFQ species being subdivided will receive an amount of QS or IBQ for  each newly created area that is equivalent to the amount they held for  the area before it was subdivided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Area recombination. When two areas are combined for an IFQ  species, the QS or IBQ held by individuals in each area will be adjusted  proportionally such that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total QS or IBQ for the area sums to 100 percent, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person holding QS or IBQ in the newly created area will  receive the same amount of total QP or IBQ pounds as they would if the  areas had not been combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Area line movement. When a management area boundary line is  moved for an IFQ species, the QS or IBQ held by individuals in each area  will be adjusted proportionally such that they each maintain their same  share of the trawl allocation on a coastwide basis (a fishing area may  expand or decrease, but the individual's QP or IBQ pounds for both areas  combined wouldn't change because of the change in areas). In order to  achieve this end, the holders of QS or IBQ in the area being reduced  will receive QS or IBQ for the area being expanded, such that the total  QP or IBQ pounds they would be issued will not be reduced as a result of  the area reduction. Those holding QS or IBQ in the area being expanded  will have their QS or IBQ reduced such that the total QP or IBQ pounds  they receive in the year of the line movement will not increase as a  result of the expansion (nor will it be reduced).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reallocation with subdivision of a species group. If at any time  after the initial allocation an IFQ species which is a species group is  subdivided, each species or species group resulting from the subdivision  will be an IFQ species. QS owners for the species group being subdivided  will receive an amount of QS for each newly created IFQ species that is  equivalent to the amount they held for the species group before it was  subdivided. For example, if a person holds one percent of a species  group before the subdivision, that person will hold one percent of the  QS for each IFQ species resulting from the subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section. If eligible, NMFS will issue a QS  permit, and will establish a QS account to track QS and IBQ balances for  all IFQ species identified at Sec. 660.140(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. NMFS will issue  initial allocations of QS and IBQ in accordance with paragraph (d)(8) of  this section. Transfers of QS and IBQ, and of QP or IBQ pounds, are  subject to provisions at paragraph (d)(3) of this section. QS permit  owners can monitor the status of their QS and IBQ, and associated QP and  IBQ pounds, throughout the year in their QS account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual QS adjustments. On or about January 1 each year, QS  permit owners will be notified, via the IFQ Web site and their QS  account, of any adjustments to their QS and/or IBQ allocations, for each  of the IFQ species. Updated QS and/or IBQ values, if applicable, will  reflect the results of: any recalculation of initial allocation formulas  resulting from changes in provisional OYs used in the allocation  formulas or appeals, any redistribution of QS and IBQ (e.g., resulting  from permanent revocation of applicable permits, subject to accumulation  limits), and any transfers of QS and/or IBQ made during the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)(3)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Non-whiting QP annual sub-allocations. NMFS will issue QP for  IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut annually by  multiplying the QS permit owner's QS for each such IFQ species by that  year's shorebased trawl allocation for that IFQ species. Deposits to QS  accounts for IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut  will be made on or about January 1 each year. Until the implementation  of any regulatory changes developed pursuant to the first program review  for the trawl rationalization program, the resulting AMP QP will be  issued to all QS permit owners in proportion to their non-whiting QS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are known  by January 1, deposits to QS accounts for IFQ species will be made on or  about January 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are not  known by January 1, NMFS will issue QP in two parts. On or about January  1, NMFS will deposit QP based on the shorebased trawl allocation  multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest  specifications for that year. After the final harvest specifications are  established later in the year, NMFS will deposit additional QP to the QS  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In years where the non-tribal deductions from the TAC, ACL, or  ACT when specified, described at Sec. 660.55(b), were too high and  would go unharvested, NMFS may increase the shorebased trawl allocation,  consistent with Sec. 660.60(c), and issue additional QP to QS accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pacific whiting QP annual allocation. NMFS will issue QP for  Pacific whiting annually by multiplying the QS permit owner's QS for  Pacific whiting by that year's shorebased trawl allocation for Pacific  whiting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is  known by January 1, deposits to QS accounts for Pacific whiting will be  made on or about January 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not  known by January 1, NMFS will issue Pacific whiting QP in two parts. On  or about January 1, NMFS will deposit Pacific whiting QP based on the  shorebased trawl allocation multiplied by the lower end of the range of  potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year.  After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established  later in the year, NMFS will deposit additional QP to QS accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In years where the non-tribal deductions from the TAC, ACL, or  ACT when specified, described at Sec. 660.55(b), were too high and  would go unharvested, NMFS may increase the shorebased trawl allocation,  consistent with Sec. 660.60(c), and issue additional QP to QS accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In years where there is reapportionment of Pacific whiting,  specified at Sec. 660.131(h), to the Shorebased IFQ Program, NMFS will  increase the shorebased trawl allocation and issue additional QP to QS  accounts as described at paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pacific halibut IBQ pounds annual allocation. NMFS will issue  IBQ pounds for Pacific halibut annually by multiplying the QS permit  owner's IBQ percent by the Shorebased IFQ Program component of the trawl  bycatch mortality limit for that year. Deposits to QS accounts for  Pacific halibut IBQ pounds will be made on or about January 1 each year.  Mortality of any size Pacific halibut count against IBQ pounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In years where the Pacific halibut total constant exploitation  yield is known by January 1, deposits to QS accounts will be made on or  about January 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In years where the Pacific halibut total constant exploitation  yield is not known by January 1, NMFS will issue QP in two parts. On or  about January 1, NMFS will deposit QP based on some portion of the  International Pacific Halibut Commission's staff recommended total  constant exploitation yield from their interim meeting. After the final  Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is established from  the International Pacific Halibut Commission's annual meeting, NMFS will  deposit additional QP to the QS account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For the trawl fishery, NMFS will issue QP based on the following  shorebased trawl allocations:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2015 shorebased    2016 shorebased</p><p class="depth0">IFQ species                         Management area          trawl allocation   trawl allocation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(mt)</em> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arrowtooth flounder........................  .............................           3,193.93           3,033.38 BOCACCIO...................................

Only the  following persons are eligible to own QS permits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A United States citizen, that is eligible to own and control a  U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46 U.S.C.  12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent  citizenship requirement for entities);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A permanent resident alien, that is eligible to own and control  a U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46 U.S.C.  12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent  citizenship requirement for entities); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A corporation, partnership, or other entity established under  the laws of the United States or any State, that is eligible to own and  control a U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement pursuant to 46  U.S.C. 12113 (general fishery endorsement requirements and 75 percent  citizenship requirement for entities). However, there is an exception  for any entity that owns a mothership that participated in the west  coast groundfish fishery during the allocation period and is eligible to  own or control that U.S. fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement  pursuant to sections 203(g) and 213(g) of the AFA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Registration. A QS account will be established by NMFS with the  issuance of a QS permit. The administrative functions associated with  the Shorebased IFQ Program (e.g., account registration, landing  transactions, and transfers) are designed to be accomplished online;  therefore, a participant must have access to a computer with Internet  access and must set up online access to their QS account to participate.  The computer must have Internet browser software installed (e.g.,  Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla Firefox); as well as the Adobe  Flash Player software version 9.0 or greater. NMFS will mail initial QS  permit owners instructions to set up online access to their QS account.  NMFS will use the QS account to send messages to QS permit owners; it is  important for QS   permit owners to monitor their online QS account and all associated  messages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> QS permit application process. NMFS will accept a QS permit  application from January 1 to November 30 of each calendar year. QS  permit applications received between December 1 and December 31 will be  processed by NMFS in the following calendar year. NMFS will issue only  one QS permit to each unique person, as defined at Sec. 660.11 subject  to the eligibility requirements at paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.  Each applicant must submit a complete application. A complete  application includes a QS permit application form, payment of required  fees, complete documentation of QS permit ownership on the Trawl  Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph  (d)(4)(iv) of this section, and a complete economic data collection form  if required under Sec. 660.114. NMFS may require additional  documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the  application. The QS permit application will be considered incomplete  until the required information is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Initial administrative determination. For all complete  applications, NMFS will issue an IAD that either approves or disapproves  the application. If approved, the QS permit serves as the IAD. If  disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. If  the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 30 calendar days, the IAD  becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on  behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective date. The QS permit is effective on the date given on  the permit and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Appeals. If NMFS does not accept the QS permit application, the  applicant may appeal the IAD consistent with the general permit appeals  process defined at Sec. 660.25(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Renewal, change of permit ownership, and transfers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Renewal.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> QS permits expire at the end of each calendar year, and must be  renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in order to  remain in effect the following year. A complete QS permit renewal  package must be received by NMFS no later than November 30 to be  accepted by NMFS. A QS permit owner may submit a paper renewal package  after January 1 of the following year as described in paragraph  (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notification to renew QS permits will be sent by SFD by  September 15 each year to the QS permit owner's most recent address in  the SFD record. The QS permit owner shall provide SFD with notice of any  address change within 15 days of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A complete QS permit renewal package must be received by  November 30 of each calendar year. If a complete QS permit renewal  package is not received by November 30, NMFS will not renew the QS  permit, the associated QS account will not be activated in the following  calendar year, and QS may not be transferred. NMFS will not issue QP or  IBQ pounds associated with the non-renewed QS permit for that year. Any  QP or IBQ pounds derived from the QS or IBQ in the inactive QS account  will be distributed to the active QS accounts in proportion to the QS or  IBQ for each IFQ species given on the renewed QS permit. If a QS permit  is not renewed during the October 1 through November 30 renewal period,  the QS permit owner may renew after January 1 in the following year by  submission of a paper renewal application, or may renew the QS permit  during the next October 1 through November 30 renewal period. For  renewals submitted after January 1, QPs allocated as specified at  paragraph (d)(1) of this section will not be allocated to the QS account  in that year. The QS permit owner will be able to transfer QS  percentages from the time the QS account is activated until November 30  of that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> QS permits will not be renewed until SFD has received a complete  application for a QS permit renewal, which includes payment of required  fees, complete documentation of QS permit ownership on the Trawl  Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph  (d)(4)(iv) of this section, a complete economic data collection form if  required under Sec. 660.114. The QS permit renewal will be considered  incomplete until the required information is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Effective Date. A QS permit is effective on the date given on  the permit and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> IAD and appeals. QS permit renewals are subject to the permit  appeals process specified at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change of permit ownership and transfer restrictions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Change in QS permit ownership. Ownership of a QS permit cannot be  registered to another individual or entity. The QS permit owner cannot  change or add additional individuals or entities as owners of the permit  (i.e., cannot change the legal name of the permit owner(s) as given on  the permit). Any change in ownership of the QS permit requires the new  owner(s) to apply for a QS permit, and is subject to accumulation limits  and approval by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transfers of QS or IBQ or QP or IBQ pounds. (1) General.  Transfers of QS or IBQ from one QS account to another QS account and  transfers of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel account must  be accomplished via the online QS account. During the year there may be  situations where NMFS deems it necessary to prohibit transfers (i.e.,  account reconciliation, system maintenance, or for emergency fishery  management reasons). To make a transfer, a QS permit owner must initiate  a transfer request by logging onto the online QS account. Following the  instructions provided on the Web site, the QS permit owner must enter  pertinent information regarding the transfer request including, but not  limited to: IFQ species, amount of QS, IBQ, QP, or IBQ pounds to be  transferred for each IFQ species; name and any other identifier of the  eligible transferee (e.g., QS permit number, vessel account number); and  the value of the transferred QS, IBQ, QP, or IBQ pounds for each IFQ  species. The online system will verify whether all information has been  entered and whether the transfer complies with ownership limits or  vessel limits, as applicable. If the information is not accepted, an  electronic message will record as much in the transferor's QS account  explaining the reason(s). If the information is accepted, the online  system will record the pending transfer in both the transferor's QS  account and the transferee's QS account or vessel account. The  transferee must approve the transfer by electronic signature in order  for the transfer to be completed. If the transferee accepts the  transfer, the online system will record the transfer and confirm the  transaction in both the transferor's QS account and the transferee's QS  account or vessel account through a transaction confirmation notice.  Once the transferee accepts the transaction, the transaction is final  and permanent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of QS or IBQ between QS accounts. Beginning January 1,  2014, QS permit owners may transfer QS (except for widow rockfish QS) or  IBQ to another owner of a QS permit, subject to accumulation limits and  approval by NMFS. The prohibition on transferability of widow rockfish  QS is extended indefinitely pending final action on reallocation of  widow rockfish QS, or a NMFS determination that no such reallocation  will occur, except under U.S. court order or authorization and as  approved by NMFS. QS or IBQ is transferred as a percent, divisible to  one-thousandth of a percent (i.e., greater than or equal to 0.001%). QS  or IBQ cannot be transferred to a vessel account. Owners of non-renewed  QS permits may not transfer QS. QP in QS accounts cannot be transferred  between QS accounts. NMFS will allocate QP based on the QS percentages  as listed on a QS permit that was renewed during the previous October 1  through November 30 renewal period. QS transfers will be recorded in the  QS account but will not become effective for purposes of allocating QPs  until the following year. QS or IBQ may not be transferred between  December 1 through December 31 each year. Any QS transaction that is  pending as of December 1 will be administratively retracted. NMFS will  allocate QP for the following year based on the QS percentages as of  December 1 of each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transfer of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel  account. QP or IBQ pounds must be transferred in whole pounds (i.e., no  fraction of a QP can be transferred). QP or IBQ pounds must be  transferred to a vessel account in order to be used. Transfers of QP or   IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel account are subject to vessel  accumulation limits and NMFS' approval. Once QP or IBQ pounds are  transferred from a QS account to a vessel account (accepted by the  transferee/vessel owner), they cannot be transferred back to a QS  account and may only be transferred to another vessel account. QP or IBQ  pounds may not be transferred from one QS account to another QS account.  All QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account must be transferred to one or  more vessel accounts by September 1 each year. If, after September 1 in  any year, the Regional Administrator makes a decision to reapportion  Pacific whiting from the tribal to the non-tribal fishery or NMFS  releases additional QP consistent with Sec. 660.60(c) and paragraph  (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the following actions will be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> NMFS will credit QS accounts with additional QP proportionally,  based on the QS percent for a particular QS permit owner and the  increase in the shorebased trawl allocation specified at paragraph  (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The QS account transfer function will be reactivated by NMFS  from the date that QS accounts are credited with additional QP to allow  QS permit owners to transfer QP to vessel accounts only for those IFQ  species with additional QP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date--(1) Transfer of QS or IBQ between QS accounts is  effective on the date approved by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of QP or IBQ pounds from a QS account to a vessel  account is effective on the date approved by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> IAD and appeals. Transfers are subject to the permit appeals  process specified at Sec. 660.25 (g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Accumulation limits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> QS and IBQ control limits. QS and IBQ  control limits are accumulation limits and are the amount of QS and IBQ  that a person, individually or collectively, may own or control. QS and  IBQ control limits are expressed as a percentage of the Shorebased IFQ  Program's allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Control limits for individual species. No person may own or  control, or have a controlling influence over, by any means whatsoever  an amount of QS or IBQ for any individual species that exceeds the  Shorebased IFQ Program accumulation limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Control limit for aggregate nonwhiting QS holdings. To determine  how much aggregate nonwhiting QS a person holds, NMFS will convert the  person's QS to pounds. This conversion will always be conducted using  the trawl allocations applied to the 2010 OYs, until such time as the  Council recommends otherwise. Specifically, NMFS will multiply each  person's QS for each species by the shoreside trawl allocation for that  species. The person's pounds for all nonwhiting species will be summed  and divided by the shoreside trawl allocation of all nonwhiting species  to calculate the person's share of the aggregate nonwhiting trawl quota.  To determine the shoreside trawl allocation for the purpose of  determining compliance with the aggregate nonwhiting control limit, for  species that have specific trawl allocation percentages in Amendment 21,  NMFS will apply the Amendment 21 trawl allocation percentages to (set  forth at Sec. 660.55) the 2010 OYs, and where applicable, will deduct  the preliminary set-asides for the at-sea sectors from Amendment 21. For  species that do not have specific trawl allocation percentages in  Amendment 21, NMFS will apply a percentage based on the Northwest  Fishery Science Center final report on 2010 estimated total fishing  mortality of groundfish by sector, or, if the final report for 2010 is  not available, based on the most recent report available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Shorebased IFQ Program accumulation limits are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Accumulation Limits ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">QS and IBQ</p><p class="depth0">Species category                      control limit</p><p class="depth0">(in percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Arrowtooth flounder....................................             10 Bocaccio S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat...................             13.2 Canary rockfish........................................              4.4 Chilipepper S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat................             10 Cowcod S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.....................             17.7 Darkblotched rockfish..................................              4.5 Dover sole.............................................              2.6 English sole...........................................              5 Lingcod:</p><p class="depth0">N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat..........................              2.5</p><p class="depth0">S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat..........................              2.5 Longspine thornyhead:</p><p class="depth0">N. of 34[deg]27[min] N. lat..........................              6 Minor rockfish complex N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.:</p><p class="depth0">Shelf species........................................              5</p><p class="depth0">Slope species........................................              5 Minor rockfish complex S. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.:</p><p class="depth0">Shelf species........................................              9</p><p class="depth0">Slope species........................................              6 Other flatfish stock complex...........................             10 Pacific cod............................................             12 Pacific halibut (IBQ) N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat......              5.4 Pacific ocean perch N. of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat........              4 Pacific whiting (shoreside)............................             10 Petrale sole...........................................              3 Sablefish:</p><p class="depth0">N. of 36[deg] N. lat.

The lender must make subsequent annual submissions of the  letter and Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form to maintain  the exception. Letters requesting the exception and complete Trawl  Identification of Ownership Interest Forms may be submitted to NMFS,  West Coast Region, Permits Office, ATTN: Fisheries Permit Office, Bldg.  1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115.

Any person  that owns a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or  renewing a QS permit shall document those persons that have an ownership  interest in the limited entry trawl or QS permit greater than or equal  to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD  via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. For renewal, if  the limited entry trawl permit and QS permit have identical ownership  interest, only one form need be submitted attesting to such ownership.  SFD will not issue a QS permit unless the Trawl Identification of  Ownership Interest Form has been completed. Further, if SFD discovers  through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form  that a person owns or controls more than the accumulation limits and is  not authorized to do so under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, the  person will be notified and the QS permit will be issued up to the  accumulation limit specified in the QS or IBQ control limit table from  paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. NMFS may request additional  information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with  accumulation limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Divestiture. Accumulation limits will be calculated by first  calculating the aggregate non-whiting QS limit and then the individual  species QS or IBQ control limits. For QS permit owners (including any  person who has ownership interest in the owner named on the permit) that  are found to exceed the accumulation limits during the initial issuance  of QS permits, an adjustment period will be provided during which they  will have to completely divest their QS or IBQ in excess of the  accumulation limits. QS or IBQ will be issued for amounts in excess of  accumulation limits only for owners of limited entry permits as of  November 8, 2008, if such ownership has been registered with NMFS by  November 30, 2008. The owner of any permit acquired after November 8,  2008, or if acquired earlier, not registered with NMFS by November 30,  2008, will only be eligible to receive an initial allocation for that  permit of those QS or IBQ that are within the accumulation limits; any  QS or IBQ in excess of the accumulation limits will be redistributed to  the remainder of the initial recipients of QS or IBQ in proportion to  each recipient's initial allocation of QS or IBQ for each species. Any  person that qualifies for an initial allocation of QS or IBQ in excess  of the accumulation limits will be allowed to receive that allocation,  but must divest themselves of the QS (except for widow rockfish QS) or  IBQ in excess of the accumulation limits by November 30, 2015. Holders  of QS or IBQ in excess of the control limits may receive and use the QP  or IBQ pounds associated with that excess, up to the time their  divestiture is completed. Once the divestiture period is completed, any  QS or IBQ held by a person (including any person who has ownership  interest in the owner named on the permit) in excess of the accumulation  limits will be revoked and redistributed to the remainder of the QS or  IBQ owners in proportion to the QS or IBQ. On or about January 1, 2016,  NMFS will redistribute the revoked QS or IBQ excess percentages to the  QS or IBQ owners in proportion to their QS or IBQ holdings based on  ownership records as of January 1, 2016. No compensation will be due for  any revoked shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Appeals.

Through these two  processes, preliminary QS totaling 100 percent for each Group 1 species  will be allocated.

This pool will  be allocated to each qualifying limited entry trawl permit based on the  permit's relative history from 1994 through 2003. For each limited entry  trawl permit, NMFS will calculate a set of relative histories using the  following methodology. First, NMFS will sum the permit's landings by  each year for each Group 1 species/species group and area subdivision.  Second, NMFS will divide each permit's annual sum for a particular  species/species group and area subdivision by the shoreside limited  entry trawl fleet's annual sum for the same species/species group and  area subdivision. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for  each permit by species/species group and area subdivision by adding all  relative histories for the permit together and subtracting the three  years with the lowest relative history for the permit. The result for  each permit by species/species group and areas subdivision will be  divided by the aggregate sum of all total relative histories of all  qualifying limited entry trawl permits for that species/species group  and area subdivision.

NMFS will reduce the whiting QS allocation to each limited entry  trawl permit by 20 percent for the initial QS allocation to shoreside  processors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Allocation of initial issuance of whiting QS for shoreside  processors. NMFS will calculate the amount of whiting QS available to  shoreside processors from the 20 percent adjustment of whiting QS  allocations in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(F) of this section. For each  eligible shoreside processor, whiting QS will be allocated based on the  eligible shoreside processor's relative history from 1998 through 2004.  Only the deliveries for which the shoreside processor is the first  processor of the fish will be used in the calculation of whiting  relative history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each shoreside processor which has received deliveries of at  least 1 mt of whiting from whiting trips in each of any two years from  1998 through 2004, NMFS will calculate a whiting relative history for  each qualifying year, as follows. First, NMFS will sum the shoreside  processor's receipts of whiting for each year. Second, NMFS will  calculate the relative history for each year by dividing each shoreside  processor's annual sum of whiting receipts by the aggregate annual sum  of whiting received by all shoreside processors in that year.   NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each shoreside  processor by adding all relative histories for the shoreside processor  together and subtracting the two years with the lowest relative history.  NMFS will then divide the result for each shoreside processor by the  aggregate sum of all total relative histories for whiting by all  qualifying shoreside processors. The result from this calculation will  then be multiplied by 20 percent to determine the shoreside processor's  whiting QS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of making an initial issuance of whiting QS to a  shoreside processor, NMFS will attribute landing history to the Pacific  whiting shoreside first receiver reported on the landing receipt (the  entity responsible for filling out the state landing receipt) as  recorded in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010. History may be  reassigned to a shoreside processor not on the state landings receipt as  described at paragraph (d)(8)(vi)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)(14)</em> to (16) of this section convert  these amounts into QS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The target species are arrowtooth flounder and petrale sole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The four bycatch areas are defined latitudinally and by depth.  The latitudinal areas are (a) north of 47[deg]30[min] N. lat., and (b)  between 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. and 47[deg]30[min] N. lat. Each  latitudinal area is further divided by depth into areas shoreward and  seaward of the trawl Rockfish Conservation Area as defined at Sec.  660.130(e)(4), subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will review the permit  logbook data for that permit and sum target species catch recorded for  the years 2003-2006, resulting in total target species catch in each of  the four areas for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006 for both  target species in aggregate. For practicability, seaward or shoreward of  the RCA as identified in the logbook data is defined as being deeper  than or shallower than 115 fathoms, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will also sum the  target species catch by area into total aggregate target species catch  for each permit for the years 2003 through 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will divide logbook  aggregate target species catch in each area (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(3)  of this section) by the sum of the permit's catch of each target species  in all four bycatch areas (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(4) of this section)  to create a set of area catch ratios for each permit. (Note: The sum of  all four area catch ratios in aggregate equals 1 for each permit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For limited entry trawl permits where the vessel registered to  the permit did not submit logbooks showing any catch of either of the  two target species for any of the years 2003 through 2006, NMFS will use  the following formula to calculate area target catch ratios: NMFS will  sum by area all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook area target  catches from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(3) of this section, and sum all  limited entry trawl permits' total logbook target catches across all  four areas from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(4) of this section; and divide  these sums to create average permit logbook area target catch ratios.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> NMFS will calculate the 2011 non-whiting initial issuance  allocation amount for each of the two target species by multiplying the  limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for each by the  corresponding initial issuance allocation percentage for the non-whiting  sector given in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(A)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)(iv)(B)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> NMFS will calculate each limited entry trawl permit's projected  non-whiting sector quota pounds for the two target species for 2011 by  multiplying the 2011 non-whiting sector short term allocation amounts  for each of the target species by the permit's QS allocation percentage  for the species from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will sum the  projected quota pounds for the two target species from paragraph  (d)(8)(iv)(H)(9) of this section to get a total projected weight of the  two target species for the limited entry trawl permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will multiply the  projected 2011 total weight of the two target species by the applicable  area catch ratio for each area as calculated in either paragraph  (d)(8)(iv)(H)(5) of this section (permits with logbook data) or  paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)(6) of this section (permits without logbook  data).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> NMFS will apply WCGOP average halibut bycatch ratios (observed  halibut catch/total of two target species catch) by area.

If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the  deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive consideration for  initial issuance of QS and IBQ and a QS permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prequalified application. A ``prequalified application'' is a  partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined  the landings history that may qualify the applicant for an initial  issuance of QS and IBQ. The application package will include a  prequalified application (with landings history), a Trawl Identification  of Ownership Interest form, and any other documents NMFS believes are  necessary to aid the limited entry permit owner in completing the QS  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For current trawl limited entry permit owners, NMFS will mail a  prequalified application to all owners, as listed in the NMFS permit  database at the time applications are mailed, that NMFS determines may  qualify for QS or IBQ.

NMFS will not  accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the  application deadline. There are no hardship exemptions for this  deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Permit transfer during application period. NMFS will not  review or approve any request for a change in limited entry trawl permit  owner at any time after either November 1, 2010 or the date upon which  the application is received by NMFS, whichever occurs first, until a  final decision is made by the Regional Administrator on behalf of the  Secretary of Commerce regarding the QS and IBQ to be issued for that  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Initial Administrative Determination (IAD). NMFS will issue an  IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application  deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for initial issuance of  QS and IBQ, the applicant will receive a QS permit specifying the  amounts of QS and IBQ for which the applicant has qualified and the  applicant will be registered to a QS account. If NMFS disapproves or  partially disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons.  As part of the IAD, NMFS will indicate whether the QS permit owner  qualifies for QS or IBQ in amounts that exceed the accumulation limits  and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (d)(4)(v)  of this section, or whether the QS permit owner qualifies for QS or IBQ  that exceed the accumulation limits and does not qualify to receive the  excess under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section. If the applicant does  not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the  IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on  behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Appeals. For QS permits and QS/IBQ issued under this section,  the appeals process and timelines are specified at Sec. 660.25(g),  subpart C. For the initial issuance of QS/IBQ and the QS permits, the  bases for appeal are described in paragraph (d)(8)(vi) of this section.  An additional basis for appeal for whiting QS based on shoreside  processing is an allegation that the shoreside processor or Pacific  whiting shoreside first receiver to which a QS permit and whiting QS  have been assigned was not in fact the first processor of the fish  included in the qualifying landings history. The appellant must submit  credible information supporting the allegation that they were in fact  the first shoreside processor for the fish in question. Items not  subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of  permit landings data or Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver  landings data in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vessel accounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. In order to participate in the  Shorebased IFQ Program, a vessel must be registered to an eligible  limited entry trawl permit. A vessel account will be established on  request for an owner of a vessel registered to an eligible limited entry  trawl permit in order to track QP and IBQ pounds. QP or IBQ pounds will  have the same species/species groups and area designations as the QS or  IBQ from which it was issued. Annually, QS or IBQ (expressed as a  percent) are converted to QP or IBQ pounds (expressed as a weight) in a  QS account. QP or IBQ pounds may be transferred from a QS account to a  vessel account or from one vessel account to another vessel account. QP  or IBQ pounds are required to cover catch (landings and discards) by  limited entry trawl vessels of all IFQ species/species groups, except  for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gear exception. Vessels registered to a limited entry trawl  permit using the following gears would not be required to cover  groundfish catch with QP or Pacific halibut catch with IBQ pounds: Non- groundfish trawl, gear types defined in the coastal pelagic species FMP,  gear types defined in the highly migratory species FMP, salmon troll,  crab pot, and limited entry fixed gear when the vessel also has a  limited entry permit endorsed for fixed gear and has declared that it is  fishing in the limited entry fixed gear fishery. Vessels using gears  falling under this exception are subject to the open access fishery  restrictions and limits when declared in to an open access fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Species exception. QP are not required for the following  species: Longspine thornyheads south of 34[deg]27[min] N. lat., minor  nearshore rockfish (north and south), black rockfish (coastwide),  California scorpionfish, cabezon, kelp greenling, shortbelly rockfish,  and ``other fish'' (as defined at Sec. 660.11, subpart C, under the  definition of ``groundfish''). For these species, trip limits remain in  place as specified in the trip limit tables at Table 1 (North) and Table  1 (South) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility and registration--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eligibility. To establish a  registered vessel account, a person must own a vessel and that vessel  must be registered to a groundfish limited entry permit endorsed for  trawl gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section,  including a change in the legal name of the vessel owner(s), will  require the new owner to register with   NMFS for a vessel account. A participant must have access to a computer  with Internet access and must set up online access to their vessel  account to participate. The computer must have Internet browser software  installed (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla Firefox); as well  as the Adobe Flash Player software version 9.0 or greater. NMFS will  mail vessel account owners instructions to set up online access to their  vessel account. NMFS will use the vessel account to send messages to  vessel owners in the Shorebased IFQ Program; it is important for vessel  owners to monitor their online vessel account and all associated  messages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Renewal, change of account ownership, and transfer of QP or IBQ  pounds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Renewal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Vessel accounts expire at the end of each  calendar year, and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of  each year in order to ensure the vessel account is active on January 1  of the following year. A complete vessel account renewal package must be  received by SFD no later than November 30 to be accepted by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notification to renew vessel accounts will be issued by SFD by  September 15 each year to the vessel account owner's most recent address  in the SFD record. The vessel account owner shall provide SFD with  notice of any address change within 15 days of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any vessel account for which SFD does not receive a vessel  account renewal request by November 30 will have its vessel account  inactivated by NMFS at the end of the calendar year. NMFS will not issue  QP or IBQ pounds to the inactivated vessel account. Any QP or IBQ pounds  in the vessel account will expire and surplus QP or IBQ pounds will not  be available for carryover. A non-renewed vessel account may be renewed  in a subsequent year by submission of a complete vessel account renewal  package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vessel accounts will not be renewed until SFD has received a  complete application for a vessel account renewal, which includes  payment of required fees, a complete documentation of permit ownership  on the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under  paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, and a complete economic data  collection form as required under Sec. 660.114. The vessel account  renewal will be considered incomplete until the required information is  submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Effective Date. A vessel account is effective on the date issued  by NMFS and remains effective until the end of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> IAD and appeals. Vessel account renewals are subject to the  appeals process specified at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in vessel account ownership. Vessel accounts are non- transferable and ownership of a vessel account cannot change (i.e.,  cannot change the legal name of the owner(s) as given on the vessel  account). If the ownership of a vessel changes (as given on a USCG or  state vessel registration documentation), then a new vessel account must  be opened by the new owner in order for the vessel to participate in the  Shorebased IFQ Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transfer of QP or IBQ pounds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. QP or IBQ pounds  may only be transferred from a QS account to a vessel account or between  vessel accounts. QP or IBQ pounds cannot be transferred from a vessel  account to a QS account. Transfers of QP or IBQ pounds are subject to  accumulation limits. QP or IBQ pounds in a vessel account may only be  transferred to another vessel account. QP or IBQ pounds must be  transferred in whole pounds (i.e., no fraction of a QP or IBQ pound can  be transferred). During the year there may be situations where NMFS  deems it necessary to prohibit transfers (i.e., account reconciliation,  system maintenance, or for emergency fishery management reasons).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transfer procedures. QP or IBQ pound transfers from one vessel  account to another vessel account must be accomplished via the online  vessel account. To make a transfer, a vessel account owner must initiate  a transfer request by logging onto the online vessel account. Following  the instructions provided on the Web site, the vessel account owner must  enter pertinent information regarding the transfer request including,  but not limited to: IFQ species, amount of QP or IBQ pounds to be  transferred for each IFQ species (in whole pound increments);   name and any other identifier of the eligible transferee (e.g., USCG  documentation number or state registration number, as applicable) of the  eligible vessel account receiving the transfer; and the value of the  transferred QP or IBQ pounds. The online system will verify whether all  information has been entered and whether the transfer complies with  vessel limits, as applicable. If the information is not accepted, an  electronic message will record as much in the transferor's vessel  account explaining the reason(s). If the information is accepted, the  online system will record the pending transfer in both the transferor's  and the transferee's vessel accounts. The transferee must approve the  transfer by electronic signature. If the transferee accepts the  transfer, the online system will record the transfer and confirm the  transaction in both accounts through a transaction confirmation notice.  Once the transferee accepts the transaction, the transaction is final  and permanent. QP or IBQ pounds may be transferred between vessel  accounts at any time during January 1 through December 31 each year  unless otherwise notified by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Accumulation limits--(i) Vessel limits. For each IFQ species or  species group specified in this paragraph, vessel accounts may not have  QP or IBQ pounds in excess of the QP vessel limit (annual limit) in any  year, and, for species covered by unused QP vessel limits (daily limit),  may not have QP or IBQ pounds in excess of the unused QP vessel limit at  any time. The QP vessel limit (annual limit) is calculated as all QPs  transferred in minus all QPs transferred out of the vessel account.

Any person  that owns a vessel registered to a limited entry trawl permit and that  is applying for or renewing a vessel account shall document those  persons that have an ownership interest in the vessel greater than or  equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the  SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will  not issue a vessel account unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership  Interest Form has been completed. NMFS may request additional  information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with  accumulation limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> of  this section, the percentage is designated as a ``routine management  measure'' at Sec. 660.60(c)(1)(v) and may be changed through an  inseason action, but may not exceed 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Surplus QP or IBQ pounds. A vessel account with a surplus of QP  or IBQ pounds (unused QP or IBQ pounds) for any IFQ species at the end  of the fishing year may carryover for use in the immediately following  year an amount of unused QP or IBQ pounds up to its carry over limit.  The carryover limit for the surplus is calculated as 10 percent of the  cumulative total QP or IBQ pounds (used and unused, less any transfers  or any previous carryover amounts) in the vessel account at the end of  the year. Based on a Council recommendation, NMFS will credit the  carryover amount to the vessel account in the immediately following year  once NMFS has completed its end-of-the-year account reconciliation. If  NMFS disagrees with all or part of the Council recommendation, NMFS will  not credit the vessel accounts, as appropriate, and will notify the  Council in writing, describing the basis for the decision. NMFS will  notify vessel account owners through the online IFQ system of any  additional QP or IBQ pounds resulting from a carryover of surplus  pounds, and will not issue those pounds above the vessel limits  (specified at paragraph (e)(4) of this section). If there is a decline  in the ACL between the base year and the following year in which the QP  or IBQ pounds would be carried over, the carryover amount will be  reduced in proportion to the reduction in the ACL. When surplus QP or  IBQ pounds are issued, those pounds are deposited directly into the  vessel accounts and do not increase the shorebased trawl allocation.  Surplus QP or IBQ pounds may not be carried over for more than one year.  Any amount of QP or IBQ pounds in a vessel account and in excess of the  carryover amount will expire on December 31 each year and will not be  available for any future use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deficit QP or IBQ pounds. If an IFQ species is reallocated  between the base year and the following year due to changes in  management areas or subdivision of a species group as specified at  paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section, a vessel account will not  carryover the deficit for that IFQ species into the following year. A  vessel account with a deficit (negative balance) of QP or IBQ pounds for  any IFQ species in the current year may cover that deficit with QP or  IBQ pounds from the following year without incurring a violation if all  of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vessel account owner declares out of the Shorebased IFQ  Program for the year in which the deficit occurred. The vessel account  owner must submit a signed, dated, and notarized letter to OLE,  declaring out of the Shorebased IFQ Program for the remainder of the  year and invoking the   carryover provision to cover the deficit. Signed, dated, and notarized  letters may be submitted to NMFS, West Coast Region, Office of Law  Enforcement, ATTN VMS, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA  98115. If the vessel account owner covers the deficit later within the  same calendar year, the vessel may re-enter the Shorebased IFQ Program.  If the deficit occurs less than 30 days before the end of the calendar  year, exiting out of the Shorebased IFQ Program for the remainder of the  year is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of QP or IBQ pounds required to cover the deficit  from the current fishing year is less than or equal to the vessel's  carryover limit for a deficit. The carryover limit for a deficit is  calculated as 10 percent of the total cumulative QP or IBQ pounds (used  and unused, less any transfers or any previous carryover amounts) in the  vessel account 30 days after the date the deficit is documented; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sufficient QP or IBQ pounds are transferred in to the vessel  account to cure the deficit within 30 days of NMFS' issuance of QP or  IBQ pounds to QS accounts in the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Appeals. An appeal to a vessel account action follows the  appeals process defined at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Fees.

To be considered complete, the form must also be  notarized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(C)</em> of this section must be included with the  application. NMFS will not issue a first receiver site license to a  person that does not have a current, NMFS-accepted catch monitoring  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Catch monitoring plan review process. NMFS will accept a catch  monitoring plan if it includes all the required elements specified in  paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and conforms with the actual  operations and layout at the site. A site inspection is   required for new first receiver site licenses. For re-registration of an  existing first receiver site license, the site must be inspected at  least once every three years or more frequently, as deemed necessary by  NMFS, or by a NMFS designated representative. If NMFS does not accept a  catch monitoring plan for any reason, a new or revised catch monitoring  plan may be required of the first receiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Arranging a site inspection. After receiving a complete  application for a first receiver site license, if a site inspection is  required, NMFS will contact the applicant to schedule a site inspection.  A complete application for a first receiver site license must include  the proposed catch monitoring plan. NMFS may request a representative of  the first receiver to be at the site at the time of inspection. If the  requested representative of the first receiver is not made available for  the inspection, the site inspection may be postponed until the requested  representative of the first receiver is made available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contents of a catch monitoring plan. The catch monitoring plan  must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Catch sorting.

Detail how IFQ first receiver  staff will ensure that sorting is complete; what steps will be taken to  prevent unsorted catch from entering the factory or other areas beyond  the location where catch sorting and weighing can be monitored from the  observation area; and what steps will be taken if unsorted catch enters  the factory or other areas beyond the location where catch sorting and  weighing can be monitored from the observation area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Scales used for weighing IFQ landings. Identify each scale that  will be used to weigh IFQ landings by the type and capacity and describe  where it is located and what it will be used for. Each scale must be  appropriate for its intended use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Printed record. Identify all scales that will be used to weigh  IFQ landings that cannot produce a complete printed record as specified  at Sec. 660.15(c), subpart C. State how the scale will be used, and how  the plant intends to produce a complete and accurate record of the total  weight of each delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Weight monitoring. Detail how the IFQ first receiver will ensure  that all catch is weighed and the process used to meet the catch  weighing requirements specified at paragraph (j) of this section. If a  catch monitoring plan proposes the use of totes in which IFQ species  will be weighed, or a deduction for the weight of ice, the catch  monitoring plan must detail how the process will accurately account for  the weight of ice and/or totes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Delivery points. Identify specific delivery points where catch  is removed from an IFQ vessel. The delivery point is the first location  where fish removed from a delivering catcher vessel can be sorted or  diverted to more than one location. If the catch is pumped from the hold  of a catcher vessel or a codend, the delivery point will be the location  where the pump first discharges the catch. If catch is removed from a  vessel by brailing, the delivery point normally will be the bin or belt  where the brailer discharges the catch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Observation area. Designate and describe the observation area.  The observation area is a location where a catch monitor may monitor the  flow of fish during a delivery, including: Access to the observation  area, the flow of fish, and lighting used during periods of limited  visibility.

NMFS will  accept a catch monitoring plan if it includes the required elements  specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and conforms with  the actual operations and layout at the site. For the first receiver  site license to remain in effect, the owner or manager must notify NMFS  in writing of any and all changes made in IFQ first receiver operations  or layout that do not conform to the catch monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Changing a NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan. An owner and  manager may change an accepted catch monitoring plan by submitting a  plan addendum to NMFS. NMFS will accept the modified catch monitoring  plan if it continues to meet the performance standards specified in  paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. Depending on the nature and  magnitude of the change requested, NMFS may require an additional catch  monitoring plan inspection. A catch monitoring plan addendum must  contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and signature of the person submitting the addendum;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Address, telephone number, fax number and email address (if  available) of the person submitting the addendum;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A complete description of the proposed catch monitoring plan  change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Completed EDC form. A first receiver site license application  must include a complete economic data collection form as required under  Sec. 660.113(b), subpart D. The application for a first receiver site  license will be marked incomplete until the required information is  submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Initial administrative determination. For all complete  applications, NMFS will issue an IAD that either approves or disapproves  the application. If approved, the IAD will include a first receiver site  license. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this  determination. NMFS will not reissue a first receiver site license until  the required cost recovery program fees, as specified at Sec. 660.115,  have been paid. The IAD, appeals, and final decision process for the  cost recovery program is specified at Sec. 660.115(d)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective dates. The first receiver site license is valid from  the effective date identified on the license until June 30, or until the  state license required by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is no  longer effective, whichever occurs first. A first receiver site license  may not be valid for more than 365 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Re-registration of FRSL in subsequent years. Existing first  receiver site license holders must reapply annually by following the  application process specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If  the existing license holder fails to reapply, the first receiver site  license will expire as specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.  NMFS will not reissue a first receiver site license until all required  cost recovery program fees, as specified at Sec. 660.115, associated  with that license have been paid. For existing first receiver site  license holders to continue to receive IFQ landings without a lapse in  the effectiveness of their first receiver site license, the following  re-registration deadlines apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> NMFS will mail a first receiver site license application to  existing license holders on or about February 1 each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicants who want to have their new license effective for  July 1 must submit their complete re-registration application to NMFS by  April 15. For those first receiver site license holders who do not  submit a complete re-registration application by April 15, NMFS may not  be able to issue the new license by July 1 of that calendar year, and  will issue the new license as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Change in ownership of an IFQ first receiver. If there are any  changes to the owner of a first receiver registered to a first receiver  site license during a calendar year, the first receiver site license is  void.

The first receiver site license holder is  considered the fish buyer as defined at Sec. 660.111, and must comply  with the cost recovery program specified at Sec. 660.115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Retention requirements (whiting and non-whiting vessels)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Non-whiting vessels. Vessels participating in the Shoreside IFQ Program  other than vessels participating in the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery  (non-whiting vessels) may discard IFQ species/species groups, provided  such discards are accounted for and deducted from QP in the vessel  account. Non-whiting vessels must discard Pacific halibut and the  discard mortality must be accounted for and deducted from IBQ pounds in  the vessel account. Non-whiting vessels may discard non-IFQ species and  non-groundfish species. The sorting of catch, the weighing and  discarding of any IBQ and IFQ species, and the retention of IFQ species  must be monitored by the observer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whiting maximized retention vessels. Maximized retention vessels  participating in the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery may discard minor  operational amounts of catch at sea if the observer has accounted for  the discard (i.e., a maximized retention fishery).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whiting vessels sorting at-sea. Vessels participating in the  Pacific whiting IFQ fishery that sort their catch at sea (whiting  vessels sorting at-sea) may discard IFQ species/species groups, provided  such discards are accounted for and deducted from QP in the vessel  account. Whiting vessels sorting at sea must discard Pacific halibut and  such discard mortality must be accounted for and deducted from IBQ  pounds in the vessel account. Whiting vessels sorting at-sea may discard  non-IFQ species and non-groundfish species. The sorting of catch,  weighing and discarding of any IFQ or IBQ species must be monitored by  the observer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Observer requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Observer coverage requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Coverage.

A catch monitor is required be present at  each IFQ first receiver whenever an IFQ landing is received, unless the  first receiver has been granted a written waiver from the catch monitor  requirements by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procurement of catch monitor services. Owners or managers of  each IFQ first receiver must arrange for catch monitor services from a  catch monitor provider prior to accepting IFQ landings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Catch monitor safety. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each IFQ first receiver must adhere to  all applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe  operation and maintenance of a processing and/or receiving facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unless alternative arrangements are approved by the Catch  Monitor Program Office, the working hours of each individual catch  monitor will be limited as follows: the time required for a catch  monitor to conduct monitoring duties must not exceed 14 consecutive  hours in a calendar day. Following a monitoring shift of more than 10  hours, each catch monitor must be provided with a minimum 8 hours break  before they may resume monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Catch monitor access. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each IFQ first receiver must allow  catch monitors free and unobstructed access to the catch throughout the  sorting process and the weighing process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The IFQ first receiver must ensure that there is an observation  area available to the catch monitor that meets the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Access to the observation area. The observation area must be  freely accessible to NMFS staff, NMFS-authorized personnel, or  authorized officers at any time a valid catch monitoring plan is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Monitoring the flow of fish. The catch monitor must have an  unobstructed view or otherwise be able to monitor the entire flow of  fish between the delivery point and a location where all sorting has  takes place and each species has been weighed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Adequate lighting. Adequate lighting must be provided during  periods of limited visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each IFQ first receiver must allow catch monitors free and  unobstructed access to any documentation required by regulation  including fish tickets, scale printouts and scale test results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lockable cabinet. Each IFQ first receiver must provide a secure,  dry, and lockable cabinet or locker with the   minimum interior dimensions of two feet wide by two feet tall by two  feet deep for the exclusive use the catch monitor and NMFS staff or  NMFS-authorized agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Plant liaison for the catch monitor. Each IFQ first receiver  must designate a plant liaison. The plant liaison is responsible for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Orienting new catch monitors to the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assisting in the resolution of catch monitoring concerns; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Informing NMFS if changes must be made to the catch monitoring  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reasonable assistance. Each IFQ first receiver must provide  reasonable assistance to the catch monitors to enable each catch monitor  to carry out his or her duties. Reasonable assistance includes, but is  not limited to: informing the monitor when bycatch species will be  weighed, and providing a secure place to store equipment and gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Catch weighing requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Catch monitoring plan. All IFQ  first receivers must operate under a NMFS-accepted catch monitoring plan  for each specific physical location where IFQ landings will be received,  purchased, or taken custody, control, or possession of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sorting and weighing IFQ landings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approved scales. The IFQ  first receiver must ensure that all IFQ species received from a vessel  making an IFQ landing are weighed on a scale(s) that meets the  requirements specified at Sec. 660.15(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Printed record. All scales identified in the catch monitoring  plan accepted by NMFS during the first receiver site license application  process, must produce a printed record as specified at Sec. 660.15(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Scales that may be exempt from printed report. An IFQ first  receiver that receives no more than 200,000 pounds of groundfish in any  calendar month will be exempt from the requirement to produce a printed  record provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The first receiver has not previously operated under a catch  monitoring plan where a printed record was required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The first receiver ensures that all catch is weighed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The catch monitor, NMFS staff, or authorized officer can verify  that all catch is weighed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Retention of printed records. An IFQ first receiver must  maintain printouts on site until the end of the fishing year during  which the printouts were made consistent with Sec. 660.113(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Weight monitoring. An IFQ first receiver must ensure that it is  possible for the catch monitor, NMFS staff, or authorized officer to  verify the weighing of all catch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Catch sorting. All fish delivered to the plant must be sorted  and weighed by species as specified at Sec. 660.130(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Complete sorting. Sorting and weighing must be completed prior  to catch leaving the area that can be monitored from the catch monitor's  observation area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Pacific whiting. For Pacific Whiting taken with midwater  trawl gear, IFQ first receivers may use an in-line conveyor or hopper  type scale to derive an accurate total catch weight prior to sorting.  Immediately following weighing of the total catch and prior to  processing or transport away from the point of landing, the catch must  be sorted to the species groups specified at Sec. 660.130(d) and all  incidental catch (groundfish and non groundfish species) must be  accurately weighed and the weight of incidental catch deducted from the  total catch weight to derive the weight of a single predominant species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> For all other IFQ landings the following weighing standards  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A belt or automatic hopper scale may be used to weigh all of the  catch prior to sorting. All but a single predominant species must then  be reweighed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An in-line conveyor or automatic hopper scale may be used to  weigh the single predominant species after catch has been sorted. Other  species must be weighed in a manner that facilitates tracking of the  weights of those species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> IFQ species or species group may be weighed in totes on a  platform scale capable of printing a label or tag and recording the  label or tag information to memory for printing a report as specified at  Sec. 660.15. The label or tag must remain affixed to the tote until   the tote is emptied. The label or tag must show the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The species or species group;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The weight of the fish in the tote;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The date the label or tag was printed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The vessel name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Totes and ice. If a catch monitoring plan proposes the use of  totes in which fish will be weighed, or a deduction for the weight of  ice, the deduction must be accurately accounted for. No deduction may be  made for the weight of water or slime. This standard may be met by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taring the empty or pre-iced tote on the scale prior to filling  with fish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Labeling each tote with an individual tare weight. This weight  must be accurate within 500 grams (1 pound if scale is denominated in  pounds) for any given tote and the average error for all totes may not  exceed 200 grams (8 ounces for scales denominated in pounds);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An alternate approach accepted by NMFS. NMFS will only accept  approaches that do not involve the estimation of the weight of ice or  the weight of totes and allow NMFS staff or an authorized officer to  verify that the deduction or tare weight is accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An alternate approach accepted by NMFS in the catch monitoring  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IFQ first receiver responsibilities relative to catch weighing  and monitoring of catch weighing. The IFQ first receiver must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Ensure that all IFQ landings are sorted and weighed as  specified at Sec. 660.130(d) and in accordance with an approved catch  monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catch monitors, NMFS staff, and authorized officers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Have a  catch monitor on site the entire time an IFQ landing is being offloaded,  sorted, or weighed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notify the catch monitor of the offloading schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Provide catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer  with unobstructed access to any areas where IFQ species are or may be  sorted or weighed at any time IFQ species are being landed or processed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Ensure that catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer  are able to simultaneously observe the weighing of catch on the scale  and read the scale display at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Ensure that printouts of the scale weight of each delivery or  offload are made available to catch monitors, NMFS staff, or an  authorized officer at the time printouts are generated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scale tests. All testing must meet the scale test standards  specified at Sec. 660.15(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Gear switching. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Participants in the Shorebased IFQ Program  may take IFQ species using any legal groundfish non-trawl gear (i.e.,  gear switching) and are exempt from the gear endorsements at Sec.  660.25(b)(3) for limited entry fixed gear permits, provided the  following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vessel must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vessel must be registered to a vessel account that is not  in deficit on any IFQ species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel operator must have submitted a valid gear  declaration for the trip that declares ``Limited entry groundfish non- trawl, shorebased IFQ,'' as specified in Sec. 660.13(d)(5)(iv)(A), and  does not declare any other designation (a Shorebased IFQ Program trip  may not be combined with any other designation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The vessel must comply with prohibitions applicable to limited  entry fixed gear fishery as specified at Sec. 660.212, gear  restrictions applicable to limited entry fixed gear as specified in  Sec. Sec. 660.219 and 660.230(b), and management measures specified in  Sec. 660.230(d), including restrictions on the fixed gear allowed  onboard, its usage, and applicable fixed gear groundfish conservation  area restrictions, except that the vessel will not be subject to limited  entry fixed gear trip limits when fishing in the Shorebased IFQ Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The vessel must comply with the limited entry trawl trip limits  for species/species groups not covered under the Shorebased IFQ Program  or whiting trip limits outside the primary season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The vessel must comply with recordkeeping and reporting  requirements applicable to limited entry trawl gear as specified in  Sec. 660.113.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The vessel must comply with and observer requirements and all   other provisions of the Shoreside IFQ Program as specified in this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Adaptive management program--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The adaptive  management program (AMP) is a set-aside of 10 percent of the non-whiting  QS to address the following objectives:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Community stability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Processor stability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conservation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unintended/unforeseen consequences of IFQ management; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Facilitating new entrants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> AMP QP pass through. The 10 percent of non-whiting QS will be  reserved for the AMP, but the resulting AMP QP will be issued to all QS  permit owners in proportion to their non-whiting QS until the  implementation of any regulatory changes developed pursuant to the first  program review for the trawl rationalization program.
