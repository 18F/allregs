As specified in Sec. 1700.15(b), special packaging is required to meet the child test requirements and the applicable adult test requirements of this Sec. 1700.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Condition of packages to be tested--(A) Tamper-resistant feature. Any tamper-resistant feature of the package to be tested shall be removed prior to testing unless it is part of the package's child-resistant design. Where a package is supplied to the consumer in an outer package that is not part of the package's child-resistant design, one of the following situations applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the child test, the package is removed from the outer package, and the outer package is not given to the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In both the adult tests, if the outer package bears instructions for how to open or properly resecure the package, the package shall be given to the test subject in the outer package. The time required to remove the package from the outer package is not counted in the times allowed for attempting to open and, if appropriate, reclose the package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In both the adult tests, if the outer package does not bear any instructions relevant to the test, the package will be removed from the outer package, and the outer package will not be given to the test subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reclosable packages--adult tests. In both the adult tests, reclosable packages, if assembled by the testing agency, shall be properly secured at least 72 hours prior to beginning the test to allow the materials (e.g., the closure liner) to ``take a set.'' If assembled by the testing agency, torque-dependent closures shall be secured at the same on-torque as applied on the packaging line. Application torques must be recorded in the test report. All packages shall be handled so that no damage or jarring will occur during storage or transportation. The packages shall not be exposed to extreme conditions of heat or cold. The packages shall be tested at room temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Child test--(i) Test subjects--(A) Selection criteria. Use from 1 to 4 groups of 50 children, as required under the sequential testing criteria in table 1. No more than 20% of the children in each group shall be tested at or obtained from any given site. Each group of children shall be randomly selected as to age, subject to the limitations set forth below. Thirty percent of the children in each group shall be of age 42-44 months, 40% of the children in each group shall be of age 45-48 months, and 30% of the children in each group shall be of age 49-51 months. The children's ages in months shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test subjects--(A) Selection criteria. Use from 1 to 4 groups of 50 children, as required under the sequential testing criteria in table 1. No more than 20% of the children in each group shall be tested at or obtained from any given site. Each group of children shall be randomly selected as to age, subject to the limitations set forth below. Thirty percent of the children in each group shall be of age 42-44 months, 40% of the children in each group shall be of age 45-48 months, and 30% of the children in each group shall be of age 49-51 months. The children's ages in months shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Arrange the birth date and test date by the numerical designations for month, day, and year (e.g., test date: 8/3/1990; birth date: 6/23/1986).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subtract the month, day, and year numbers for the birth date from the respective numbers for the test date. This may result in negative numbers for the months or days. (e.g.,[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.026</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiply the difference in years by 12 to obtain the number of months in the difference in years, and add this value to the number of months that was obtained when the birth date was subtracted from the test date (i.e., 4 x 12 = 48; 48 + 2 = 50). This figure either will remain the same or be adjusted up or down by 1 month, depending on the number of days obtained in the subtraction of the birth date from the test date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the number of days obtained by subtracting the days in the birth date from the days in the test date is +16 or more, 1 month is added to the number of months obtained above. If the number of days is -16 or less, subtract 1 month. If the number of days is between -15 and +15 inclusive, no change is made in the number of months. Thus, for the example given above, the number of days is -20, and the number of months is therefore 50 - 1 = 49 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gender distribution. The difference between the number of boys and the number of girls in each age range shall not exceed 10% of the number of children in that range. The children selected should have no obvious or overt physical or mental handicap. A parent or guardian of each child shall read and sign a consent form prior to the child's participation. (The Commission staff will not disregard the results of tests performed by other parties simply because informed consent for children is not obtained.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test failures. A test failure shall be any child who opens the special packaging or gains access to its contents. In the case of unit packaging, however, a test failure shall be any child who opens or gains access to the number of individual units which constitute the amount that may produce serious personal injury or serious illness, or a child who opens or gains access to more than 8 individual units, whichever number is lower, during the full 10 minutes of testing. The number of units that a child opens or gains access to is interpreted as the individual units from which the product has been or can be removed in whole or in part. The determination of the amount of a substance that may produce serious personal injury or serious illness shall be based on a 25-pound (11.4 kg) child. Manufacturers or packagers intending to use unit packaging for a substance requiring special packaging are requested to submit such toxicological data to the Commission's Office of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sequential test. The sequential test is initially conducted using 50 children, and, depending on the results, the criteria in table 1 determine whether the package is either child-resistant or not child-resistant or whether further testing is required. Further testing is required if the results are inconclusive and involves the use of one or more additional groups of 50 children each, up to a maximum of 200 children. No individual shall administer the test to more than 30% of the children tested in each group. Table 1 gives the acceptance (pass), continue testing, and rejection (fail) criteria to be used for the first 5 minutes and the full 10 minutes of the children's test. If the test continues past the initial 50-child panel, the package openings shown in table 1 are cumulative.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Number of Openings: Acceptance (Pass), Continue Testing, and Rejection (Fail) Criteria for the First 5</p><p class="depth0">Minutes and the Full 10 Minutes of the Children's Protocol Test----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Package openings</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative -----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Test panel               number of          First 5 minutes                  Full 10 minutes</p><p class="depth0">children  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Pass     Continue     Fail       Pass     Continue     Fail----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.................................          50        0-3       4-10        11+        0-5       6-14        15+</p><p class="depth0">2.................................         100       4-10      11-18        19+       6-15      16-24        25+3.................................         150      11-18      19-25        26+      16-25      26-34        35+4.................................         200      19-30  .........        31+      26-40  .........        41+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test procedures. The children shall be divided into groups of two. The testing shall be done in a location that is familiar to the children, for example, their customary nursery school or regular kindergarten. No child shall test more than two special packages. When more than one special package is being tested, each package shall be of a different ASTM type and they shall be presented to the paired children in random order. This order shall be recorded. The children shall be tested by the procedure incorporated in the following test instructions:</p><p class="depth0">Standardized Child Test Instructions</p><p class="depth0">1. Reclosable packages, if assembled by the testing agency, shall be properly secured at least 72 hours prior to the opening described in instruction number 3 to allow the materials (e.g., the closure liner) to ``take a set.'' Application torques must be recorded in the test report.</p><p class="depth0">2. All packages shall be handled so that no damage or jarring will occur during storage or transportation. The packages shall not be exposed to extreme conditions of heat or cold. The packages shall be tested at room temperature.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reclosable packages shall be opened and properly resecured one time (or more if appropriate), by the testing agency or other adult prior to testing. The opening and resecuring shall not be done in the presence of the children. (In the adult-resecuring test, the tester must not open and resecure the package prior to the test.) If multiple openings/resecurings are to be used, each of four (4) testers shall open and properly resecure one fourth of the packages once and then shall open and properly resecure each package a second, third, fourth, through tenth (or other specified number) time, in the same sequence as the first opening and resecuring. The packages shall not be opened and resecured again prior to testing. The name of each tester and the package numbers that he/she opens and resecures shall be recorded and reported. It is not necessary for the testers to protocol test the packages that they opened and resecured.</p><p class="depth0">4. The children shall have no overt physical or mental handicaps. No child with a permanent or temporary illness, injury, or handicap that would interfere with his/her effective participation shall be included in the test.</p><p class="depth0">5. The testing shall take place in a well-lighted location that is familiar to the children and that is isolated from all distractions.</p><p class="depth0">6. The tester, or another adult, shall escort a pair of children to the test area. The tester shall seat the two children so that there is no visual barrier between the children and the tester.</p><p class="depth0">7. The tester shall talk to the children to make them feel at ease.</p><p class="depth0">8. The children shall not be given the impression that they are in a race or contest. They are not to be told that the test is a game or that it is fun. They are not to be offered a reward.</p><p class="depth0">9. The tester shall record all data prior to, or after, the test so that full attention can be on the children during the test period.</p><p class="depth0">10. The tester shall use a stopwatch(s) or other timing devices to time the number of seconds it takes the child to open the package and to time the 5-minute test periods.</p><p class="depth0">11. To begin the test, the tester shall hand the children identical packages and say, ``PLEASE TRY TO OPEN THIS FOR ME.''</p><p class="depth0">12. If a child refuses to participate after the test has started, the tester shall reassure the child and gently encourage the child to try. If the child continues to refuse, the tester shall ask the child to hold the package in his/her lap until the other child is finished. This pair of children shall not be eliminated from the results unless the refusing child disrupts the participation of the other child.</p><p class="depth0">13. Each child shall be given up to 5 minutes to open his/her package. The tester shall watch the children at all times during the test. The tester shall minimize conversation with the children as long as they continue to attempt to open their packages. The tester shall not discourage the children verbally or with facial expressions. If a child gets frustrated or bored and stops trying to

open his/her package, the tester shall reassure the child and gently encourage the child to keep trying (e.g., ``please try to open the package'').</p><p class="depth0">14. The children shall be allowed freedom of movement to work on their packages as long as the tester can watch both children (e.g., they can stand up, get down on the floor, or bang or pry the package).</p><p class="depth0">15. If a child is endangering himself or others at any time, the test shall be stopped and the pair of children eliminated from the final results.</p><p class="depth0">16. The children shall be allowed to talk to each other about opening the packages and shall be allowed to watch each other try to open the packages.</p><p class="depth0">17. A child shall not be allowed to try to open the other child's package.</p><p class="depth0">18. If a child opens his/her package, the tester shall say, ``THANK YOU,'' take the package from the child and put it out of the child's reach. The child shall not be asked to open the package a second time.</p><p class="depth0">19. At the end of the 5-minute period, the tester shall demonstrate how to open the package if either child has not opened his or her package. A separate ``demo'' package shall be used for the demonstration.</p><p class="depth0">20. Prior to beginning the demonstration, the tester shall ask the children to set their packages aside. The children shall not be allowed to continue to try to open their packages during the demonstration period.</p><p class="depth0">21. The tester shall say, ``WATCH ME OPEN MY PACKAGE.''</p><p class="depth0">22. Once the tester gets the children's full attention, the tester shall hold the demo package approximately two feet from the children and open the package at a normal speed as if the tester were going to use the contents. There shall be no exaggerated opening movements.</p><p class="depth0">23. The tester shall not discuss or describe how to open the package.</p><p class="depth0">24. To begin the second 5-minute period, the tester shall say, ``NOW YOU TRY TO OPEN YOUR PACKAGES.''</p><p class="depth0">25. If one or both children have not used their teeth to try to open their packages during the first 5 minutes, the tester shall say immediately before beginning the second 5-minute period, ``YOU CAN USE YOUR TEETH IF YOU WANT TO.'' This is the only statement that the tester shall make about using teeth.</p><p class="depth0">26. The test shall continue for an additional 5 minutes or until both children have opened their packages, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth0">27. At the end of the test period, the tester shall say, ``THANK YOU FOR HELPING.'' If children were told that they could use their teeth, the tester shall say, ``I KNOW I TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD USE YOUR TEETH TODAY, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT PUT THINGS LIKE THIS IN YOUR MOUTH AGAIN'' In addition, the tester shall say, ``NEVER OPEN PACKAGES LIKE THIS WHEN YOU ARE BY YOURSELF. THIS KIND OF PACKAGE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING IN IT THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SICK.''</p><p class="depth0">28. The children shall be escorted back to their classroom or other supervised area by the tester or another adult.</p><p class="depth0">29. If the children are to participate in a second test, the tester shall have them stand up and stretch for a short time before beginning the second test. The tester shall take care that the children do not disrupt other tests in progress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Senior-adult panel--(i) Test subjects. Use a group of 100 senior adults. Not more than 24% of the senior adults tested shall be obtained from or tested at any one site. Each group of senior adults shall be randomly selected as to age, subject to the limitations set forth below. Twenty-five percent of the participants shall be 50-54 years of age, 25% of participants shall be 55-59 years of age, and 50% of the participants shall be 60-70 years old. Seventy percent of the participants of ages 50-59 and ages 60-70 shall be female (17 or 18 females shall be apportioned to the 50-54 year age group). No individual tester shall administer the test to more than 35% of the senior adults tested. The adults selected should have no obvious or overt physical or mental disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test subjects. Use a group of 100 senior adults.

Twenty-five percent of the participants shall be 50-54 years of age, 25% of participants shall be 55-59 years of age, and 50% of the participants shall be 60-70 years old. Seventy percent of the participants of ages 50-59 and ages 60-70 shall be female (17 or 18 females shall be apportioned to the 50-54 year age group). No individual tester shall administer the test to more than 35% of the senior adults tested. The adults selected should have no obvious or overt physical or mental disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Screening procedures. Participants who are unable to open the packaging being tested in the first 5-minute time period, are given a screening test. The screening tests for this purpose shall use two packages with conventional (not child-resistant (CR) or ``special'') closures. One closure shall be a plastic snap closure and the other a CT plastic closure. Each closure shall have a diameter of 28 mm18%, and the CT closures shall have been resecured 72 hours before testing at 10 inch-pounds of torque. The containers for both the snap- and CT-type closures shall be round plastic containers, in sizes of 2 ounce\1/2\ ounce for the CT-type closure and 8 drams4 drams for the snap-type closure. Persons who cannot open and close both of the screening packages in 1-minute screening tests shall not be counted as participants in the senior-adult panel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> SAUE. The senior adult use effectiveness (SAUE) is the percentage of adults who both opened the package in

the first (5-minute) test period and opened and (if appropriate) properly resecured the package in the 1-minute test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test procedures. The senior adults shall be tested individually, rather than in groups of two or more. The senior adults shall receive only such printed instructions on how to open and properly secure the special packaging as will appear on or accompany the package as it is delivered to the consumer. The senior-adult panel is tested according to the procedure incorporated in the following senior-adult panel test instructions:</p><p class="depth0">Test Instructions for Senior Test</p><p class="depth0">The following test instructions are used for all senior tests. If non-reclosable packages are being tested, the commands to close the package are eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">1. No adult with a permanent or temporary illness, injury, or disability that would interfere with his/her effective participation shall be included in the test.</p><p class="depth0">2. Each adult shall read and sign a consent form prior to participating. Any appropriate language from the consent form may be used to recruit potential participants. The form shall include the basic elements of informed consent as defined in 16 CFR 1028.116. Examples of the forms used by the Commission staff for testing are shown at Sec. 1700.20(d). Before beginning the test, the tester shall say, ``PLEASE READ AND SIGN THIS CONSENT FORM.'' If an adult cannot read the consent form for any reason (forgot glasses, illiterate, etc.), he/she shall not participate in the test.</p><p class="depth0">3. Each adult shall participate individually and not in the presence of other participants or onlookers.</p><p class="depth0">4. The tests shall be conducted in well-lighted and distraction-free areas.</p><p class="depth0">5. Records shall be filled in before or after the test, so that the tester's full attention is on the participant during the test period. Recording the test times to open and resecure the package are the only exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">6. To begin the first 5-minute test period, the tester says, ``I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO OPEN AND PROPERLY CLOSE THESE TWO IDENTICAL PACKAGES ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOUND ON THE CAP.'' (Specify other instruction locations if appropriate.)</p><p class="depth0">7. The first package is handed to the participant by the tester, who says, ``PLEASE OPEN THIS PACKAGE ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CAP.'' (Specify other instruction locations if appropriate.) If the package contains product, the tester shall say, ``PLEASE EMPTY THE (PILLS, TABLETS, CONTENTS, etc.) INTO THIS CONTAINER.'' After the participant opens the package, the tester says, ``PLEASE CLOSE THE PACKAGE PROPERLY, ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CAP.'' (Specify other instruction locations if appropriate)</p><p class="depth0">8. Participants are allowed up to 5 minutes to read the instructions and open and close the package. The tester uses a stopwatch(s) or other timing device to time the opening and resecuring times. The elapsed times in seconds to open the package and to close the package are recorded on the data sheet as two separate times.</p><p class="depth0">9. After 5 minutes, or when the participant has opened and closed the package, whichever comes first, the tester shall take all test materials from the participant. The participant may remove and replace the closure more than once if the participant initiates these actions. If the participant does not open the package and stops trying to open it before the end of the 5-minute period, the tester shall say, ``ARE YOU FINISHED WITH THAT PACKAGE, OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY AGAIN?'' If the participant indicates that he/she is finished or cannot open the package and does not wish to continue trying, skip to Instruction 13.</p><p class="depth0">10. To begin the second test period, the tester shall give the participant another, but identical, package and say, ``THIS IS AN IDENTICAL PACKAGE. PLEASE OPEN IT ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CAP.'' (Specify other instruction locations if appropriate.) If the package contains product, the tester shall say, ``PLEASE EMPTY THE (PILLS, TABLETS, CONTENTS, etc.) INTO THIS CONTAINER.'' After the participant opens the package, the tester says, ``PLEASE CLOSE THE PACKAGE PROPERLY, ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CAP.'' (Specify other instruction locations if appropriate.)</p><p class="depth0">11. The participants are allowed up to 1 minute (60 full seconds) to open and close the package. The elapsed times in seconds to open and to close the package are recorded on the data sheet as two separate times. The time that elapses between the opening of the package and the end of the instruction to close the package is not counted as part of the 1-minute test time.</p><p class="depth0">12. After the 1-minute test, or when the participant has opened and finished closing the package, whichever comes first, the tester shall take all the test materials from the participant. The participant shall not be allowed to handle the package again. If the participant does not open the package and stops trying to open it before the end of the 1-minute period, the tester shall say, ``ARE YOU FINISHED WITH THAT PACKAGE, OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY AGAIN?'' If the participant indicates that he/she is finished or cannot open the package and does not

wish to continue trying, this shall be counted as a failure of the 1-minute test.</p><p class="depth0">13. Participants who do not open the package in the first 5-minute test period are asked to open and close two non-child-resistant screening packages. The participants are given a 1-minute test period for each package. The tester shall give the participant a package and say, ``PLEASE OPEN AND PROPERLY CLOSE THIS PACKAGE.'' The tester records the time for opening and closing, or 61 seconds, whichever is less, on the data sheet. The tester then gives the participant the second package and says, ``PLEASE OPEN AND PROPERLY CLOSE THIS PACKAGE.'' The time to open and resecure, or 61 seconds, whichever is less, shall be recorded on the data sheet.</p><p class="depth0">14. Participants who cannot open and resecure both of the non-child-resistant screening packages are not counted as part of the 100-seniors panel. Additional participants are selected and tested.</p><p class="depth0">15. No adult may participate in more than two tests per sitting. If a person participates in two tests, the packages tested shall not be the same ASTM type of package.</p><p class="depth0">16. If more adults in a sex or age group are tested than are necessary to determine SAUE, the last person(s) tested shall be eliminated from that group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Younger-adult panel. (i) One hundred adults, age 18 to 45 inclusive, with no overt physical or mental handicaps, and 70% of whom are female, shall comprise the test panel for younger adults. Not more than 35% of adults shall be obtained or tested at any one site. No individual tester shall administer the test to more than 35% of the adults tested. The adults shall be tested individually, rather than in groups of two or more. The adults shall receive only such printed instructions on how to open and properly resecure the special packaging as will appear on the package as it is delivered to the consumer. Five minutes shall be allowed to complete the opening and, if appropriate, the resecuring process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One hundred adults, age 18 to 45 inclusive, with no overt physical or mental handicaps, and 70% of whom are female, shall comprise the test panel for younger adults.

The number of adults who successfully open the special packaging and then properly resecure the special packaging (if resecuring is appropriate) is the percent of adult-use effectiveness of the special packaging. In the case of unit packaging, the percent of adult-use effectiveness shall be the number of adults who successfully open a single (unit) package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The standards published as regulations issued for the purpose of designating particular substances as being subject to the requirements for special packaging under the act will stipulate the percent of child-resistant effectiveness and adult-use effectiveness required for each and, where appropriate, will include any other conditions deemed necessary and provided for in the act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> It is recommended that manufacturers of special packaging, or producers of substances subject to regulations issued pursuant to the act, submit to the Commission summaries of data resulting from tests conducted in accordance with this protocol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recommendations.

CPSC will use the adult-resecuring test where an objective determination (e.g., visual or mechanical) that a package is properly resecured cannot be made. The adult-resecuring test is performed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Adult-Resecuring Procedure</p><p class="depth0">1. After the adult participant in either the senior-adult test of 16 CFR 1700.20(a)(3) or the younger-adult test of 16 CFR 1700.20(a)(4) has resecured the package, or at the end of the test period (whichever comes first), the tester shall take the package and place it out of reach. The adult participant shall not be allowed to handle the package again.</p><p class="depth0">2. The packages that have been opened and appear to be resecured by adults shall be tested by children according to the child-test procedures to determine if the packages have been properly resecured. The packages are given to the children without being opened or resecured again for any purpose.</p><p class="depth0">3. Using the results of the adult tests and the tests of apparently-resecured packaging by children, the adult use effectiveness is calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Adult use effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0">1. The number of adult opening and resecuring failures, plus the number of packages that were opened by the children during the full 10-minute test that exceeds 20% of the apparently-resecured packages, equals the total number of failures.</p><p class="depth0">2. The total number of packages tested by adults (which is 100) minus the total number of failures equals the percent adult-use effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Report format for adult-resecuring test.</p><p class="depth0">A.
