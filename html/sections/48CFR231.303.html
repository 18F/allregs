L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed  on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by  an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or  after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied  uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD  contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect  costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts  awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher  education because the same limitation is not applied to other  organizations performing similar work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the  prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of  higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's  overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Under 10 U.S.C. 2249, the costs cited in 231.205-22(a) are  unallowable.
