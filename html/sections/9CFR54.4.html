                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Normally, an application for indemnification will be initiated by a State or APHIS representative who is working with the owner of a flock that has already been determined to be an infected flock or source flock, or that is already under a State movement restriction. In such cases, the flock owner will confirm information about the flock's eligibility for indemnity that is contained in the application submitted by the State or APHIS representative. However, the owner of any flock may apply directly to receive indemnification by submitting to the Administrator a written request containing the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and social security number of the flock owner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Number and breed(s) of animals in the flock, including a current inventory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Location of flock premises;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasons the owner believes animals in his or her flock may be eligible for indemnification, including any diagnosis of scrapie made for animals in the flock; any signs of scrapie observed in the flock by the owner; and any movement of animals into the flock from flocks infected with or exposed to scrapie;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the registration papers issued in the name of the owner for any registered animals in the flock (registration papers are not required for the payment of indemnity for animals that are not registered). If the registration papers are unavailable, the owner may choose to accept a lesser indemnity in accordance with Sec. 54.6(b)(2) or the area veterinarian in charge may grant a 60-day extension or the Administrator may grant an extension longer than 60 days for the presentation of registration papers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Signed release letters addressed to any sheep or goat registry associations that maintain records of the owner's sheep or goats requesting the associations to release to APHIS all records maintained by the association on sheep or goats currently or formerly owned by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> APHIS will evaluate each application to determine whether the owner's flock contains animals eligible for indemnity in accordance with Sec. 54.3.</p>
