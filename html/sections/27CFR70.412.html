                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Collection. Taxes on distilled spirits, wines, and beer are paid  by returns. If the person responsible for paying the taxes has filed a  proper bond to defer payment, that person may be eligible to file  semimonthly or quarterly returns, with proper remittances, to cover the  taxes incurred on distilled spirits, wines, and beer during the  semimonthly or quarterly period. Payment must accompany the return  unless required to be made by electronic fund transfer (EFT). If the  taxpayer is not qualified to defer taxpayment, or has been placed on a  prepayment basis, the taxpayer must prepay the tax on the distilled  spirits, wines, or beer. Distilled spirits, wines, and beer tax returns  are filed in accordance with the instruction on the return forms, which  are furnished to industry members by TTB. Detailed information  respecting the payment of tax on liquors, including the forms to be used  and procedures to be followed, is contained in the respective  regulations described in Sec. 70.411(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment. If additional or delinquent tax liability is  disclosed by an investigation, or by an examination of records, of a  qualified plant or permittee, a notice (except where delay may  jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount involved is  nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error) is sent to the  taxpayer advising of the basis and amount of the liability and affording  the taxpayer an opportunity to submit a protest, with supporting facts,  or to request a conference.
