A notice of review action will be sent to  the applicant within 45 days of the receipt of the preapplication form  informing the applicant of the results of the review of the  preapplication form. If the review cannot be completed within 45 days,  the applicant will be informed by letter as to when the review will be  completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An Application for Federal Assistance for non-construction shall  be submitted by all applicants for grants, however, an Application for  Federal Assistance--Short Form may be utilized for single purpose and  one-time grant applications for less than $10,000 not requiring clearing  house approval, an environmental impact statement, or the relocation of  persons, businesses, or farms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Copies of the applications described in paragraphs (a) and (b)  of this section may be obtained from the Federal Aid Coordinator, State  Fish and Game Agency, and the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife  (Attention: Division of Cooperative Research), Washington, DC 20240.
