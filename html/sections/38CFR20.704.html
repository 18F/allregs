                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Hearings are conducted by a Member or Members of the  Board of Veterans' Appeals during prescheduled visits to Department of  Veterans Affairs facilities having adequate physical resources and  personnel for the support of such hearings. Subject to paragraph (f) of  this section, the hearings will be scheduled in the order specified in  Sec. 19.75 of this chapter. Requests for such hearings must be  submitted to the agency of original jurisdiction, in writing, and should  not be submitted directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of hearing. When a hearing is scheduled, the person  requesting it will be notified of its time and place, and of the fact  that the Government may not assume any expense incurred by the  appellant, the representative or witnesses attending the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for changes in hearing dates. Requests for a change in  a hearing date may be made at any time up to two weeks prior to the  scheduled date of the hearing if good cause is shown. Such requests must  be in writing, must explain why a new hearing date is necessary, and  must be filed with the office of the official of the Department of  Veterans Affairs who signed the notice of the original hearing date.  Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the  appellant and/or representative, difficulty in obtaining necessary  records, and unavailability of a necessary witness. If good cause is  shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing  date after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that  the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been  removed. If good cause is not shown, the appellant and his or her  representative will be promptly notified and given an opportunity to  appear at the hearing as previously scheduled. If the appellant elects  not to appear at the prescheduled date, the request for a hearing will  be considered to have been withdrawn. In such cases, however, the record  will be submitted for review by the Member who would have presided over  the hearing. If the presiding Member determines that good cause has been  shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing  date after the contingency which gave rise to the request for  postponement has been removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to appear for a scheduled hearing. If an appellant (or  when a hearing only for oral argument by a representative has been  authorized, the   representative) fails to appear for a scheduled hearing and a request  for postponement has not been received and granted, the case will be  processed as though the request for a hearing had been withdrawn. No  further request for a hearing will be granted in the same appeal unless  such failure to appear was with good cause and the cause for the failure  to appear arose under such circumstances that a timely request for  postponement could not have been submitted prior to the scheduled  hearing date. A motion for a new hearing date following a failure to  appear for a scheduled hearing must be in writing, must be filed within  15 days of the originally scheduled hearing date, and must explain why  the appellant failed to appear for the hearing and why a timely request  for a new hearing date could not have been submitted. Such motions must  be filed with: Director, Management and Administration (01E), Board of  Veterans' Appeals, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420.  Whether good cause for such failure to appear and the impossibility of  timely requesting postponement have been established will be determined  by the Member who would have presided over the hearing. If good cause  and the impossibility of timely requesting postponement are shown, the  hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date at the  same facility after the appellant or his or her representative gives  notice that the contingency which gave rise to the failure to appear has  been removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Withdrawal of hearing requests. A request for a hearing may be  withdrawn by an appellant at any time before the date of the hearing. A  request for a hearing may not be withdrawn by an appellant's  representative without the consent of the appellant. Notices of  withdrawal must be submitted to the office of the Department of Veterans  Affairs official who signed the notice of the hearing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advancement of the case on the hearing docket. A hearing may be  scheduled at a time earlier than would be provided for under Sec. 19.75  of this chapter upon written motion of the appellant or the  representative. The same grounds for granting relief, motion filing  procedures, and designation of authority to rule on the motion specified  in Rule 900(c) (Sec. 20.900(c) of this part) for advancing a case on  the Board's docket shall apply.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7107)  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2900-0085)  [57 FR 4109, Feb. 3, 1992, as amended at 61 FR 20451, May 7, 1996; 65 FR  14471, Mar. 17, 2000]</p>
