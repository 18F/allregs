                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act are set forth in Appendices B and D to this part. The guidelines serve as the basis for accessibility standards adopted by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1 to paragraph (a): 1. Advisory sections and figures that illustrate the technical requirements in Appendix D are available on the Internet at: www.access-board.gov. The advisory sections provide guidance only and do not contain mandatory requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2 to paragraph (a): 2. The Department of Justice adopted the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards) as the regulatory standards for the new construction and alteration of facilities subject to its regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), effective March 15, 2012. 28 CFR 35.151(c)(3), as amended at 75 FR 56163, September 15, 2010; and 28 CFR 36.406(a)(3), as amended at 75 FR 56236, September 15, 2010. For state and local governments, the 2010 Standards consist of the regulations at 28 CFR 35.151 and the versions of Appendices B and D to this part published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations. 28 CFR 35.104. For public accommodations and commercial facilities, the 2010 Standards consist of the regulations at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D and the versions of Appendices B and D to this part published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations. 28 CFR 36.104. Because Appendices B and D to this part, as published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations, were adopted by reference by the Department of Justice as part of the 2010 Standards for new construction and alteration of facilities subject to its ADA regulations, subsequent revisions to Appendices B and D by the Access Board are not included in the 2010 Standards and have no legal effect for facilities subject to its ADA regulations until adopted by the Department of Justice. Therefore, the public is cautioned not to use Appendices B and D to this part published in any edition of the Code of Federal Regulations after 2013, until such time as the later edition is adopted by the Department of Justice as a regulatory standard. Complete copies of the 2010 Standards can be obtained from the Department of Justice's ADA Web site at: http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards--index.htm, or by contacting the DOJ Information Line, at: 800-514-0301 (Voice) or 800-514-0383 (TTY).</p><p class="depth0">Note 3 to paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0">1.
