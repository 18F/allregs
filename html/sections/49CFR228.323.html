                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. (1) Potable water shall be adequately and conveniently provided to all occupants of a camp car for drinking, personal oral hygiene, washing of person, cooking, washing of foods, washing of cooking or eating utensils, and washing of premises for food preparation or processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Potable water shall be adequately and conveniently provided to all occupants of a camp car for drinking, personal oral hygiene, washing of person, cooking, washing of foods, washing of cooking or eating utensils, and washing of premises for food preparation or processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Open containers such as barrels, pails, or tanks for drinking water from which the water must be dipped or poured, whether or not they are fitted with a cover, are prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A common drinking cup and other common utensils are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Potable water source. (1) If potable water is provided in bottled form, it shall be stored in a manner recommended by the supplier in order to prevent contamination in storage. Bottled water shall not be provided as a substitute for the hot and cold running potable water required to be supplied in lavatories, showers, and sinks under this section. Bottled water shall contain a label identifying the packager and the source of the water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If potable water is provided in bottled form, it shall be stored in a manner recommended by the supplier in order to prevent contamination in storage. Bottled water shall not be provided as a substitute for the hot and cold running potable water required to be supplied in lavatories, showers, and sinks under this section. Bottled water shall contain a label identifying the packager and the source of the water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If potable water is drawn from a local source, the source must meet the drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR part 141, National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All equipment and construction used for supplying potable water to a camp car water system (e.g., a hose, nozzle, or back-flow prevention) shall be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Water hydrants. Each water hydrant, hose, or nozzle used for supplying potable water to a camp car water system shall be inspected prior to use. Each such hose or nozzle used shall be cleaned and sanitized as part of the inspection. A signed, dated record of this inspection shall be kept within the camp for the period of the connection. When the connection is terminated, a copy of each of these records must be submitted promptly to a centralized location for the railroad and maintained for one year from the date the connection was terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Training. Only a trained individual is permitted to fill the potable water systems. Each individual who fills a potable water system shall be trained in--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The approved method of inspecting, cleaning, and sanitizing hydrants, hoses, and nozzles used for filling potable water systems; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The approved procedures to prevent contamination during watering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certification. Each time that potable water is drawn from a different local source, the railroad shall obtain a certificate from a State or local health authority indicating that the water from this source is of a quality not less than that prescribed in 40 CFR part 141, National Primary Drinking Water Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or obtain such a certificate by a certified laboratory following testing for compliance with those standards. The current certification shall be kept within the camp for the duration of the connection. When the connection is terminated, a copy of each of these records must be submitted promptly to a centralized location for the railroad and maintained for one year from the date the connection was terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storage and distribution system. (1) Storage. Potable water shall be stored in sanitary containers that prevent external contaminants from entering the potable water supply. Such contaminants include biological agents or materials and substances that can alter the taste or color or are toxic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Storage. Potable water shall be stored in sanitary containers that prevent external contaminants from entering the potable water supply. Such contaminants include biological agents or materials and substances that can alter the taste or color or are toxic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dispensers. Potable drinking water dispensers shall be designed, constructed, and serviced so that sanitary conditions are maintained, must be capable of being closed, and shall be equipped with a tap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distribution lines. The distribution lines must be capable of supplying water at sufficient operating pressures to all taps for normal simultaneous operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Flushing. Each potable water system shall be drained and flushed with a disinfecting solution at least once

every 120 days. The railroad shall maintain a record of the draining and flushing of each separate system within the camp for the last two drain and flush cycles. The record shall contain the date of the work and the name(s) of the individual(s) performing the work. The original record shall be maintained with the camp. A copy of each of these records shall be sent to a centralized location for the railroad and maintained for one year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The solution used for flushing and disinfection shall be a 100 parts per million by volume (ppm) chlorine solution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The chlorine solution shall be held for one hour in all parts of the system to ensure disinfection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The chlorine solution shall be purged from the system by a complete refilling and draining with fresh potable water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The draining and flushing shall be done more frequently if an occupant reports a taste or health problem associated with the water, or following any plumbing repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reported problems. Following any report of a taste problem with the water from a system or a health problem resulting from the water in a system, samples of water from each tap or dispensing location on the system shall be collected and sent to a laboratory approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for testing for heterotrophic plate counts, total coliform, and fecal coliform. If a single sample fails any of these tests, the system must be treated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Heterotrophic plate count. Drain and flush the system within two days, and then return it to service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Total coliform. Remove the system from service, drain and flush system, resample the system, and then return the system to service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fecal coliform. Remove the system from service, drain and flush the system, resample the system, and do not return the system to service until a satisfactory result on the test of the samples is obtained from the laboratory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reports. All laboratory reports pertaining to the water system of the camp car shall be maintained with the car. Within 15 days of the receipt of such a laboratory report, a copy of the report shall be posted for a minimum of 10 calendar days at a conspicuous location within the camp car or cars affected for review by occupants. The report shall be maintained in the camp for the duration of the same connection. When the connection is terminated, the certification must be submitted promptly to a centralized location for the railroad and maintained for one year from the date the connection was terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Signage. Any water outlet/faucet within the camp car facility that supplies water not from a potable source or that is from a potable source but supplied through a system that is not maintained as required in this section, the outlet/faucet must be labeled with a sign, visible to the user and bearing a message to the following effect: ``The water is not suitable for human consumption. Do not drink the water.''</p>
