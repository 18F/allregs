                            <p class="depth0">The applicant must have an acceptable ownership interest in the  property as evidenced by one of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Full fee ownership. Acceptable full fee ownership is evidenced  by a fully marketable title with a deed vesting a fee interest in the  property to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Secure leasehold interest. A written lease is required. For  loans, the unexpired portion of the lease must not be less than 2 years  beyond the term of the promissory note. For grants, the remaining lease  period must be at least 5 years. A leasehold for mutual help housing  financed by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on  Indian lands requires no minimum lease period and constitutes acceptable  ownership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Life estate interest. To be acceptable, a life estate interest  must provide the applicant with rights of present possession, control,  and beneficial use of the property. For secured loans, generally persons  with any remainder interests must be signatories to the mortgage. All of  the remainder interests need not be included in the mortgage to the  extent that one or more of the persons holding remainder interests are  not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally  consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or if the remainder  interests are divided among such a large number of people that it is not  practical to obtain the signatures of all of the remainder interests. In  such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests  owned by the persons executing the mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Undivided interest. An undivided interest is acceptable if there  is no reason to believe that the applicant's position as an owner- occupant will be jeopardized as a result of the improvements to be made,  and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of unsecured loans or grants, if any co-owners  living or planning to live in the dwelling sign the repayment agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a secured loan, when one or more of the co-owners  are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can  legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or the ownership  interests are divided among so large a number of co-owners that it is  not practical for all of their interests to be mortgaged, their  interests not exceeding 50 percent may be excluded from the security  requirements. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the  property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Possessory rights. Acceptable forms of ownership include  possessory right on an American Indian reservation or State-owned land  and the interest of an American Indian in land held severalty under  trust patents or deeds containing restrictions against alienation,  provided that land in trust or restricted   status will remain in trust or restricted status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Land purchase contract. A land purchase contract is acceptable  if the applicant is current on all payments, and there is a reasonable  likelihood that the applicant will be able to continue meeting the  financial obligations of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Alternative evidence of ownership. If evidence, as described in  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, is not available, RHS may  accept any of the following as evidence of ownership:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records of the local taxing authority that show the applicant as  owner and that demonstrate that real estate taxes for the property are  paid by the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affidavits by others in the community stating that the applicant  has occupied the property as the apparent owner for a period of not less  than 10 years, and is generally believed to be the owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any instrument, whether or not recorded, which is commonly  accepted as evidence of ownership.</p>
