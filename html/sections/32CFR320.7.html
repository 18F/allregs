The denial letter  will inform the individual of the denial to amend the record setting  forth the reasons therefor and notifying the individual of his right to  appeal the decision to NGA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person or other agency to whom the record has been  previously disclosed shall be informed of any correction or notation of  dispute with respect to such records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> These provisions for amending records are not intended to permit  the alteration of evidence previously presented during any  administrative or quasi-judicial proceeding, such as an employee  grievance case. Any changes in such records should be made only through  the established procedures for such cases. Further, these provisions are  not designed to permit collateral attack upon what has already been the  subject of an administrative or quasi-judicial action. For example, an  individual may not use this procedure to challenge the final decision on  a grievance, but the individual would be able to challenge the fact that  such action has been incorrectly recorded in his file.</p>
