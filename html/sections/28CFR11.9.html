                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Collection. The organization head may collect a claim pursuant  to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from a person, organization, or entity other than an  agency of the United States Government by administrative offset of  monies other than salaries payable by the government. Collection by  administrative offset shall be undertaken where the claim is certain in  amount, where offset is feasible and desirable and not otherwise  prohibited, where the applicable statute of limitations has not expired,  and where the offset is in the best interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withholding of payment. Prior to the completion of the  procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department  may withhold a payment to be made to a debtor, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to withhold payment would substantially prejudice the  Department's ability to collect the debt; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably  permit completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this  section. Such prior withholding shall be followed promptly by the  completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debtor's rights. Unless the procedures described in paragraph  (b) of this section are used, prior to collecting any claim by  administrative offset, the organization head shall provide the debtor  with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notification of the nature and amount of the claim, the  intention of the organization head to collect the claim through  administrative offset, and a statement of the rights of the debtor under  this paragraph;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Department  with respect to the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An opportunity to have the Department's determination of  indebtedness reviewed by the organization head. Any request for review  by the debtor shall be in writing and be submitted to the Department  within 30 days of the date of the notice of the offset. The organization  head may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown  by the debtor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the  repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of the  Department.  If the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section are  employed, the procedures described in this paragraph shall be effected  after offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interest. The Department is authorized to assess interest and  related charges on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the  extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory  authority.</p>
