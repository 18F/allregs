                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who may file. A petition under this part may be filed with the  Commission by an interested party, including a producer of fabric or  yarn in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, a producer of apparel  in a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, or any  other person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission a  proper interest in filing a petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of petition. The Commission will consider only  petitions that address a single yarn or single fabric. The term ``a  single yarn or single fabric'' means a single product, which may be  classified in more than one heading of the HTS or may be only part of a  heading. A petition shall include the following information in support  of a request for a Commission investigation and determination under this  part, to the extent that such information is available from governmental  or other sources. To the extent information is not available from such  sources, the petition may be based on best estimates, including an  explanation of the basis therefor. If the petition does not include the  required information and/or estimates and explanation, the petition will  not be accepted, and it will instead be returned to the submitter. All  quantities must be expressed in the unit of quantity used in the  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, showing any conversion  factors used (for example, most woven fabrics are reported in square  meters, and most apparel are reported in numbers of units).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Product description. The name and description of the fabric or  yarn concerned, including fiber content, yarn size, fabric construction,  and finishing processes, specifying the United States tariff provision  under which such article is classified (to the 8-digit level if  possible) and the beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries  in which the fabric or yarn is produced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement of interest. The names and addresses of the interested  party or parties filing the petition or represented in the petition, the  location   and nature of their establishments, a description of the fabrics, yarns,  and apparel that they produce, import, and/or sell, for each party  filing or represented (including but not limited to the fabric or yarn  that is a subject of the petition), and the basis for asserting that  such person or entity is an interested party eligible to file a petition  under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Basis for certain statements. The basis for asserting that the  subject fabric or yarn produced in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African  country is available in ``commercial quantities'' and for ``use'' in a  lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries.  In support of a claim that such fabric or yarn is available in  ``commercial quantities,'' provide evidence for the 3 most recent full  years for which information is available, and partial year data for the  most recent year (if less than a full year), that such fabric or yarn is  available for sale to third parties and the quantities offered, and any  evidence of such sales to third parties. Include advertisements or other  documentation in support of such claim. In support of a claim that such  fabric or yarn is available for ``use'' in a lesser developed  beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries, provide evidence  for the 3 most recent full years for which information is available, and  partial year data for the most recent year (if less than a full year),  of any offers, orders, or contracts or other supporting documentation.  For orders already delivered, indicate the quantity involved and the  time and location of the deliveries to the apparel producer. For orders  for which deliveries have not yet been made, indicate the time or likely  time of the receipt by an apparel producer in all countries where the  fabric or yarn has been sold or offered for sale, including lesser  developed sub-Saharan African country or countries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Data concerning fabric and yarn. With respect to the subject  fabric or yarn:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data on production, sales, inventories, and capacity, that is  supportable through documentation that can be made available to the  Commission, for each firm known or believed to be producing the subject  fabric or yarn in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, for each of  the 3 most recent full years for which data are available, and partial  year data for the most recent year (if less than a full year);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name, address (house number, street, city, country, postal  mailing number), telephone number, e-mail address, and contact person  for each producer known or believed to be producing such fabric or yarn  in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Orders from apparel producers and other users. Data on orders  from apparel producers and other users in all countries where the fabric  or yarn has been sold or offered for sale, including lesser developed  beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, by country, for the most  recent full year and partial year (if less than a full year), and  projected orders for the 1-year period (October 1-September 30)  beginning after the Commission's determination. The information  furnished shall include the full fabric or yarn specification in the  order, including, but not limited to, the fiber content, yarn size,  fabric construction, finishing processes, quantities, projected delivery  time for the fabric or yarn to the customer identified in the order, and  any other information that the interested party submitting the petition  believes is relevant. It shall also include the name, address (house  number, street, city, country, postal mailing number), telephone number,  e-mail address, and contact person (i) for each beneficiary sub-Saharan  African fabric or yarn producer identified in each reported order, and  (ii) for each lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African apparel  producer or other user identified in each reported order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Estimated quantity available in next 1-year period. Estimated  production of the subject fabric or yarn, by firm, for the 1-year period  (October 1-September 30) beginning after the Commission's determination,  and an estimate of the quantity of such production of fabric or yarn, by  firm, that will be available in lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan  African countries in that 1-year period, and basis for that estimate,  including orders and other supporting documents.</p>
