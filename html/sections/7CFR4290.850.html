A Portfolio Concern cannot be required to redeem Equity Securities earlier than one year from the date of the first closing unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Portfolio Concern makes a public offering, or has a change of management or control, or files for protection under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, or materially breaches your Financing agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You make a follow-on Financing, in which case the new securities may be redeemed in less than one year, but no earlier than the redemption date associated with your earliest Financing of the Portfolio Concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Redemption price. The redemption price must be either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fixed amount that is no higher than the price you paid for the securities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount that cannot be fixed or determined before the time of the redemption. In this case, the redemption price must be based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the Portfolio Concern (such as one based on earnings or book value); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of the Portfolio Concern at the time of redemption, as determined by a professional appraisal performed under an agreement acceptable to both parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method. Any method for determining the redemption price must be agreed upon no later than the date of the first (or only) closing of the Financing.</p>
