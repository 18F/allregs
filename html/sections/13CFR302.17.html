                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. It is EDA's and the Department's policy to maintain the  highest standards of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest in  connection with the award of Investment Assistance or its use for  reimbursement or payment of costs (e.g., procurement of goods or  services) by or to the Recipient. A conflict of interest generally  exists when an Interested Party participates in a matter that has a  direct and predictable effect on the Interested Party's personal or  financial interests. A conflict also may exist where there is an  appearance that an Interested Party's objectivity in performing his or  her responsibilities under the Project is impaired. For example, an  appearance of impairment of objectivity may result from an  organizational conflict where, because of other activities or  relationships with other persons or entities, an Interested Party is  unable to render impartial assistance, services or advice to the  Recipient, a participant in the Project or to the Federal government.  Additionally, a conflict of interest may result from non-financial gain  to an Interested Party, such as benefit to reputation or prestige in a  professional field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An Interested Party also shall not, directly or indirectly,  solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment or other  benefit having monetary value, for himself or herself or for another  person or entity, from any person or organization which has obtained or  seeks to obtain Investment Assistance from EDA.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Recipient of an RLF Grant shall not lend RLF funds to an  Interested Party; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Former board members of a Recipient of an RLF Grant and members  of his or her Immediate Family shall not receive a loan from such RLF  for a period of two years from the date that the board member last  served on the RLF's board of directors.</p>
