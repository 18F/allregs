                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. It is EDA's and the Department's policy to maintain the highest standards of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest in connection with the award of Investment Assistance or its use for reimbursement or payment of costs (e.g., procurement of goods or services) by or to the Recipient. A conflict of interest generally exists when an Interested Party participates in a matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the Interested Party's personal or financial interests. A conflict also may exist where there is an appearance that an Interested Party's objectivity in performing his or her responsibilities under the Project is impaired. For example, an appearance of impairment of objectivity may

result from an organizational conflict where, because of other activities or relationships with other persons or entities, an Interested Party is unable to render impartial assistance, services or advice to the Recipient, a participant in the Project or to the Federal government. Additionally, a conflict of interest may result from non-financial gain to an Interested Party, such as benefit to reputation or prestige in a professional field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prohibition on direct or indirect financial or personal benefits. (1) An Interested Party shall not receive any direct or indirect financial or personal benefits in connection with the award of Investment Assistance or its use for payment or reimbursement of costs by or to the Recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An Interested Party also shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment or other benefit having monetary value, for himself or herself or for another person or entity, from any person or organization which has obtained or seeks to obtain Investment Assistance from EDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs incurred in violation of any conflicts of interest rules contained in this chapter or in violation of any assurances by the Recipient may be denied reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> See Sec. 315.15 of this chapter for special conflicts of interest rules for Trade Adjustment Assistance Investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules for Revolving Loan Fund (``RLF'') Grants. In addition to the rules set forth in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An Interested Party of a Recipient of an RLF Grant shall not receive, directly or indirectly, any personal or financial benefits resulting from the disbursement of RLF loans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Recipient of an RLF Grant shall not lend RLF funds to an Interested Party; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Former board members of a Recipient of an RLF Grant and members of his or her Immediate Family shall not receive a loan from such RLF for a period of two years from the date that the board member last served on the RLF's board of directors.
