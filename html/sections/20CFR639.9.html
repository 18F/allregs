                                Sec. 639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in advance?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 3(b) of WARN sets forth three conditions under which the  notification period may be reduced to less than 60 days. The employer  bears the burden of proof that conditions for the exceptions have been  met. If one of the exceptions is applicable, the employer must give as  much notice as is practicable to the union, non-represented employees,  the State dislocated worker unit, and the unit of local government and  this may, in some circumstances, be notice after the fact. The employer  must, at the time notice actually is given, provide a brief statement of  the reason for reducing the notice period, in addition to the other  elements set out in Sec. 639.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The exception under section 3(b)(1) of WARN, termed ``faltering  company'', applies to plant closings but not to mass layoffs and should  be narrowly construed. To qualify for reduced notice under this  exception:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employer must have been actively seeking capital or business  at the time that 60-day notice would have been required. That is, the  employer must have been seeking financing or   refinancing through the arrangement of loans, the issuance of stocks,  bonds, or other methods of internally generated financing; or the  employer must have been seeking additional money, credit, or business  through any other commercially reasonable method. The employer must be  able to identify specific actions taken to obtain capital or business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There must have been a realistic opportunity to obtain the  financing or business sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The financing or business sought must have been sufficient, if  obtained, to have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the  shutdown. The employer must be able to objectively demonstrate that the  amount of capital or the volume of new business sought would have  enabled the employer to keep the facility, operating unit, or site open  for a reasonable period of time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer reasonably and in good faith must have believed  that giving the required notice would have precluded the employer from  obtaining the needed capital or business. The employer must be able to  objectively demonstrate that it reasonably thought that a potential  customer or source of financing would have been unwilling to provide the  new business or capital if notice were given, that is, if the employees,  customers, or the public were aware that the facility, operating unit,  or site might have to close. This condition may be satisfied if the  employer can show that the financing or business source would not choose  to do business with a troubled company or with a company whose workforce  would be looking for other jobs. The actions of an employer relying on  the ``faltering company'' exception will be viewed in a company-wide  context. Thus, a company with access to capital markets or with cash  reserves may not avail itself of this exception by looking solely at the  financial condition of the facility, operating unit, or site to be  closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)(A)</em> of WARN applies to plant closings and mass layoffs  caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at  the time that 60-day notice would have been required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An important indicator of a business circumstance that is not  reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by some  sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside the  employer's control. A principal client's sudden and unexpected  termination of a major contract with the employer, a strike at a major  supplier of the employer, and an unanticipated and dramatic major  economic downturn might each be considered a business circumstance that  is not reasonably foreseeable. A government ordered closing of an  employment site that occurs without prior notice also may be an  unforeseeable business circumstance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test for determining when business circumstances are not  reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employer's business judgment. The  employer must exercise such commercially reasonable business judgment as  would a similarly situated employer in predicting the demands of its  particular market. The employer is not required, however, to accurately  predict general economic conditions that also may affect demand for its  products or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ``natural disaster'' exception in section 3(b)(2)(B) of WARN  applies to plant closings and mass layoffs due to any form of a natural  disaster.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Floods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or tsunamis  and similar effects of nature are natural disasters under this  provision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To qualify for this exception, an employer must be able to  demonstrate that its plant closing or mass layoff is a direct result of  a natural disaster.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> While a disaster may preclude full or any advance notice, such  notice as is practicable, containing as much of the information required  in Sec. 639.7 as is available in the circumstances of the disaster  still must be given, whether in advance or after the fact of an  employment loss caused by a natural disaster.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a plant closing or mass layoff occurs as an indirect  result of a natural disaster, the exception does not apply but the  ``unforeseeable business circumstance'' exception described in paragraph  (b) of this section may be applicable.</p>
