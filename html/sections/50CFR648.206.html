                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Framework adjustment process. In response to the triennial review, or at any other time, the Council may initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Atlantic Herring FMP, or to address gear conflicts as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustment process. After a management action has been initiated, the Council shall develop and analyze appropriate management measures over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council may delegate authority to the Herring Oversight Committee to conduct an initial review of the options being considered. The Oversight Committee shall review the options and relevant information, consider public comment, and make a recommendation to the Council.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the first framework meeting, the Council may refer the issue back to the Herring Oversight Committee for further consideration, make adjustments to the measures that were proposed, or approve of the measures and begin developing the necessary documents to support the framework adjustments. If the Council approves the proposed framework adjustments, the Council shall identify, at this meeting, a preferred alternative and/or identify the possible alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A framework document shall be prepared that discusses and shows the impacts of the alternatives. It shall be available to the public prior to the second or final framework meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to NMFS. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if changes to the management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts and a recommendation to NMFS on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be issued as a final rule, the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the Council's recommendation to NMFS includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's recommendation and supporting information NMFS may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Concur with the Council's recommended management measures and determine that the recommended management measures should be published as a final rule in the Federal Register based on the factors specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)-(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Concur with the Council's recommendation and determine that the recommended management measures should be first published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, if NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendation, the measures shall be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If NMFS does not concur, the Council shall be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible framework adjustment measures. Measures that may be changed or implemented through framework action include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Management area boundaries or additional management areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Size, timing, or location of new or existing spawning area closures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Closed areas other than spawning closures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Restrictions in the amount of fishing time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A days-at-sea system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Adjustments to specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Adjustments to the Canadian catch deducted when determining specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Distribution of the ACL;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Gear restrictions (such as mesh size, etc.) or requirements (such as bycatch-reduction devices, etc.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Vessel size or horsepower restrictions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Closed seasons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Minimum fish size;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Trip limits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Seasonal, area, or industry sector quotas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Measures to describe and identify essential fish habitat (EFH), fishing gear management measures to protect EFH, and designation of habitat areas of particular concern within EFH;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Measures to facilitate aquaculture, such as minimum fish sizes, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes, possession limits, tagging requirements, monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, permit restrictions, area closures, establishment of special management areas or zones, and any other measures included in the FMP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Changes to the overfishing definition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Vessel monitoring system requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Limits or restrictions on the harvest of herring for specific uses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Quota monitoring tools, such as vessel, operator, or dealer reporting requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Permit and vessel upgrading restrictions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Implementation of measures to reduce gear conflicts, such as mandatory monitoring of a radio channel by fishing vessels, gear location reporting by fixed gear fishermen, mandatory plotting of gear by mobile fishermen, standards of operation when conflict occurs, fixed gear marking or setting practices;

the definition/duration of `test tows,' if test tows would be utilized to determine the extent of river herring catch in a particular area(s); the threshold for river herring catch that would trigger the need for vessels to be alerted and move out of the area(s); the distance that vessels would be required to move from the area(s); and the time that vessels would be required to remain out of the area(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(35)</em> Changes to criteria/provisions for access to Northeast Multispecies Closed Areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(36)</em> River herring and shad catch caps, including species-specific caps, and vessels, permits, trips, gears, and areas to which caps apply;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(37)</em> River herring and shad Catch Cap Areas and Catch Cap Closure Areas;
