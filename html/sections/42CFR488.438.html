                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount of penalty. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The penalties are within the following  ranges, set at $50 increments:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upper range--$3,050-$10,000. Penalties in the range of $3,050- $10,000 per day are imposed for deficiencies constituting immediate  jeopardy, and as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lower range--$50-$3,000. Penalties in the range of $50-$3,000  per day are imposed for deficiencies that do not   constitute immediate jeopardy, but either caused actual harm, or caused  no actual harm, but have the potential for more than minimal harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Per instance penalty. When penalties are imposed for an instance  of noncompliance, the penalties will be in the range of $1,000-$10,000  per instance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for penalty amount. The amount of penalty is based on  CMS's or the State's assessment of factors listed in paragraph (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decreased penalty amounts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section, if immediate jeopardy is removed, but the  noncompliance continues, CMS or the State will shift the penalty amount  imposed per day to the lower range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When CMS determines that a SNF, dually-participating SNF/NF, or  NF-only facility subject to a civil money penalty imposed by CMS self- reports and promptly corrects the noncompliance for which the civil  money penalty was imposed, CMS will reduce the amount of the penalty by  50 percent, provided that all of the following apply --</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facility self-reported the noncompliance to CMS or the State  before it was identified by CMS or the State and before it was reported  to CMS or the State by means of a complaint lodged by a person other  than an official representative of the nursing home;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Correction of the self-reported noncompliance occurred on  whichever of the following occurs first:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 15 calendar days from the date of the circumstance or incident  that later resulted in a finding of noncompliance; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 10 calendar days from the date the civil money penalty was  imposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The facility waives its right to a hearing under Sec.  488.436;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The noncompliance that was self-reported and corrected did not  constitute a pattern of harm, widespread harm, immediate jeopardy, or  result in the death of a resident;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The civil money penalty was not imposed for a repeated  deficiency, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that was the  basis of a civil money penalty that previously received a reduction  under this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The facility has met mandatory reporting requirements for the  incident or circumstance upon which the civil money penalty is based, as  required by Federal and State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under no circumstances will a facility receive both the 50  percent civil money penalty reduction for self-reporting and correcting  under this section and the 35 percent civil money penalty reduction for  waiving its right to a hearing under Sec. 488.436.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Increased penalty amounts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before a hearing requested in  accordance with Sec. 488.431(d) or Sec. 488.432(a), CMS or the State  may propose to increase the per day penalty amount for facility  noncompliance which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount,  becomes sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS does and the State must increase the per day penalty amount  for any repeated deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was  previously imposed, regardless of whether the increased penalty amount  would exceed the range otherwise reserved for nonimmediate jeopardy  deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Repeated deficiencies are deficiencies in the same regulatory  grouping of requirements found at the last survey, subsequently  corrected, and found again at the next survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review of the penalty. When an administrative law judge or State  hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) finds that  the basis for imposing a civil money penalty exists, as specified in  Sec. 488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or  higher administrative review authority) may not--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review the exercise of discretion by CMS or the State to impose  a civil money penalty; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consider any factors in reviewing the amount of the penalty  other than those specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Factors affecting the amount of penalty. In determining the  amount of penalty, CMS does or the State must take into account the  following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facility's history of noncompliance, including repeated  deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facility's financial condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The factors specified in Sec. 488.404.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The facility's degree of culpability. Culpability for purposes  of this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, neglect,  indifference, or disregard for resident care, comfort or safety. The  absence of culpability is not a mitigating circumstance in reducing the  amount of the penalty.
