Describe how these specifications meet the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. Describe how the owners should show they meet your conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The steps owners must take for you to do the repair. You may set a date or a range of dates, specify the amount of time you need, and designate certain facilities to do the repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Which company (or group) you will assign to do or manage the repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If your employees or authorized warranty agents will not be doing the work, state who will and describe their qualifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> How you will ensure an adequate and timely supply of parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The effect of proposed changes on fuel consumption, driveability, and safety of the engines/equipment you will recall; include a brief summary of the information supporting these conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> How you intend to label the engines/equipment you repair and where you will place the label on the engine/equipment (see Sec.  1068.515).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We may require you to add information to your remedial plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may require you to test the proposed repair to show it will remedy the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use all reasonable means to locate owners.

Also, do not place conditions on who maintained the engine/equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We may require you to adjust your repair plan if we determine owners would be without their engines or equipment for an unreasonably long time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We will tell you in writing within 15 days of receiving your remedial plan whether we have approved or disapproved it.
