                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prohibited deception. It is a deceptive act or practice for you, directly or indirectly in connection with the extension of credit to consumers, to misrepresent the nature or extent of cosigner liability to any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prohibited unfairness. It is an unfair act or practice for you, directly or indirectly in connection with the extension of credit to consumers, to obligate a cosigner unless the cosigner is informed, before becoming obligated, of the nature of the cosigner's liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure requirement--(1) Disclosure statement. A clear and conspicuous statement must be given in writing to the cosigner before becoming obligated. In the case of open-end credit, the disclosure statement must be given to the cosigner before the time that the cosigner becomes obligated for any fees or transactions on the account. The disclosure statement must contain the following statement or one that is substantially similar:</p><p class="depth0">Notice of Cosigner</p><p class="depth0">You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.</p><p class="depth0">You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance. Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section constitutes compliance with the consumer disclosure requirement in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional content limitations. If the notice is a separate document, nothing other than the following items may appear with the notice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Your name and address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An identification of the debt to be cosigned (e.g., a loan identification number);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date (of the transaction); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The statement, ``This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cosigner defined. (1) Cosigner means a natural person who assumes liability for the obligation of a consumer without receiving goods, services, or money in return for the obligation, or, in the case of an open-end credit obligation, without receiving the contractual right to obtain extensions of credit under the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cosigner means a natural person who assumes liability for the obligation of a consumer without receiving goods, services, or money in return for the obligation, or, in the case of an open-end credit obligation, without receiving the contractual right to obtain extensions of credit under the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cosigner includes any person whose signature is requested as a condition to granting credit to a consumer, or as a condition for forbearance on collection of a consumer's obligation that is in default. The term does not include a spouse or other person whose signature is required on a credit obligation to perfect a security interest pursuant to state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A person who meets the definition in this paragraph is a cosigner, whether or not the person is designated as such on a credit obligation.</p>
