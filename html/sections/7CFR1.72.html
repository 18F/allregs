its people and programs constitute a rich source of materials on public services, often dramatic and interesting for their human values, which are suitable for production of films for television showings. The Department welcomes the interest of television film producers in its activities and maintains an ``open door'' policy with respect to the availability of factual information to such producers, as it does to representatives of other media. As its resources will permit, the Department will work with producers at their request, to assure technical accuracy of scripts and story treatments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special working relationships. In those instances where a producer of films for television seeks special Department participation such as the use of official insignia of the Department, or who request special assistance such as the services of technical advisors, use of Government equipment and similar aids which require a material expenditure of public funds, and where the proposed film will further the public service of the Department, the Department will consider entering into a special working relationship with such producer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> News film reporting exempted. Television and news film reporting of Department activities is not covered by this subpart.</p>
