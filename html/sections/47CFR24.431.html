The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical  interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material  impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in  good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical  adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the  initial provision of narrowband PCS service are subject to competitive  bidding in accordance with the procedures in subpart F of this part and  in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An application will be entitled to comparative consideration  with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission  determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public  interest.
