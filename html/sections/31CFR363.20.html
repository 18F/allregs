                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General principles. (1) Registration must express the actual ownership of, and interest in, the security. Registration conclusively establishes ownership of a security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registration must express the actual ownership of, and interest in, the security. Registration conclusively establishes ownership of a security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must provide a last name and a first name for each individual included in the registration of the security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must provide the valid taxpayer identification number for each person named in the registration of the security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forms of registration for individuals. The forms of registration available for individuals for purchases of securities made through your TreasuryDirect account are single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner, unless the forms of registration available for a security are specifically limited by the subpart governing that security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single owner. (i) A single owner is the individual named in the registration of a book-entry security or a converted savings bond without a beneficiary, secondary owner, or coowner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A single owner is the individual named in the registration of a book-entry security or a converted savings bond without a beneficiary, secondary owner, or coowner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A single owner may add a beneficiary or secondary owner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A single owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon the death of the single owner, his or her estate is entitled to the security. In determining entitlement, the law of the decedent's domicile will be followed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Registration example: ``John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Owner with beneficiary. (i) The purchaser must be named as the owner with another individual as beneficiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purchaser must be named as the owner with another individual as beneficiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner may remove or change the beneficiary without the consent of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account without the consent of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The beneficiary has no ownership rights to the security during the owner's lifetime. Upon the death of the

owner, the security becomes the property of the surviving beneficiary, despite any attempted testamentary disposition or any applicable local law to the contrary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the beneficiary does not survive the owner, the security belongs to the estate of the owner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If both the owner and the beneficiary die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, who died first, the security is the property of the estate of the owner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In order for the beneficiary to obtain the security or the redemption proceeds after the death of the owner, the beneficiary must provide proof of death of the owner. If the beneficiary has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the beneficiary does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a beneficiary named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the beneficiary requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions for the payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Registration example: ``John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789 POD (payable on death to) Jane Doe, SSN 987-65-4321.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Primary owner with secondary owner.

If the secondary owner has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the secondary owner does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a secondary owner named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the secondary owner requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Registration example: ``John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789 with Joseph Doe, SSN 987-65-4321.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forms of registration for entities. The forms of registration available for entities are sole proprietorship; partnership; corporation; limited liability company or professional limited liability company (LLC or PLLC); trust; decedent's estate; and estate of a living person such as an incompetent or a minor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship form of registration is available for an individual who is doing business as a sole proprietor. The entity account manager must be the owner of the business. Registration example: ``John Doe DBA Doe Plumbing Supplies, EIN 12-3456789, [or SSN 123-45-6789].''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Partnership. A partnership form of registration is available for two or

more individuals who are doing business as a partnership, including a limited liability partnership. Unless the name of a partnership includes the word ``partnership,'' the registration must include descriptive words indicating partnership status. The entity account manager must be a general partner, and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the partnership with regard to this account. Registration example: ``Smith and Jones Construction Company, a partnership, EIN 98-7654321, or SSN 987-65-4321.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corporation. A corporate form of registration is available for an entity that has been incorporated pursuant to state law. The registration must contain a reference to the corporate status. The entity account manager must be a corporate officer or designated employee and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the corporation with regard to this account. Registration example: ``ABC Corporation, EIN 23-4567891.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC). A LLC or PLLC form of registration is available for an entity that has registered articles of organization pursuant to state law. The registration must contain a reference to the company's status. The entity account manager must be a company official or designated employee and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the company with regard to this account. Registration example: ``Paine Dental Associates, PLLC, EIN 34-5678912'' or ``Summit Consulting Service, LLC, EIN 12-3456789.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Trust. A trust form of registration is available. The trust form of registration is not available for trusts in which the trustee is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The registration must identify the trust with specificity; at a minimum, it must include the authority or document creating the trust, the date the document was executed (except in the case of a probated will when the date is not necessary), the name of a trustee of the trust who is authorized to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account, and any information that is necessary to distinguish the trust from any other trust. The registration may also include the names of additional trustees and the full name of the trust. If one or more of the trustees are individuals, and the entity account manager is an individual trustee, the entity account manager must be named in the registration. If an organization serving as a trustee of the trust will administer this account, the entity account manager must be a duly authorized employee of that organization who has the authority to act alone on behalf of the organization in its role as trustee of the trust with regard to the account, and the organization must be named in the registration. In either case, the entity account manager must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account. Registration examples: ``John Doe, Trustee under Declaration of Trust dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789''; ``First National Bank, Trustee under Agreement with William Jones dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789''; ``John Doe or Sarah Jones, Trustees under Agreement with Jane Doe dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789''; ``Sarah Jones, Trustee under the Will of Matthew Smith, deceased, SSN 123-45-6789''; ``Jane Doe, Trustee of the Doe Family Trust dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The estate of a decedent. The decedent's estate form of registration is available for an individual or organization that has been appointed by a court according to state law to act on behalf of the estate of a decedent. This form of registration is not available where the legal representative is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The entity account manager must be a court-appointed individual legal representative who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account, or an employee of the court-appointed organizational legal representative who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account on behalf of the organization in its role as legal representative of the estate. Registration example: ``John Doe, Legal Representative of the Estate of William Jones, a decedent, EIN 12-3456789, or SSN 123-45-6789.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The estate of a living person such as an incompetent or a minor. A form of registration is available for an individual or organization that has been appointed according to state law to act on behalf of the estate of an incompetent person, a minor, or other living person. This form of registration is not available where the legal guardian is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The entity account manager must be a court-appointed legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account, or an employee of the court-appointed organizational legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account on behalf of the organization in its role as legal guardian. Registration example: ``John Doe, Legal Guardian of the estate of William Jones.'' The SSN of the incompetent person or the minor will be used.
