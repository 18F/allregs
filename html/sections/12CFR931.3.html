                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Bank shall require each member to maintain a minimum  investment in the capital stock of the Bank, both as a condition to  becoming and remaining a member of the Bank and as a condition to  transacting business with the Bank or obtaining advances and other  services from the Bank. The amount of the required minimum investment  shall be determined in accordance with the Bank's capital plan and shall  be sufficient to ensure that the Bank remains in compliance with its  minimum capital requirements. A Bank shall require each member to  maintain its minimum investment for as long as the institution remains a  member of the Bank and for as long as the member engages in any activity  with the Bank against which the Bank is required to maintain capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Bank may establish the minimum investment required of each  member as a percentage of the total assets of the member, as a  percentage of the advances outstanding to the member, as a percentage of  any other business activity conducted with the member, on any other  basis that is approved by the Finance Board, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Bank may require each member to satisfy the minimum investment  requirement through the purchase of either Class A or Class B stock, or  through the purchase of one or more combinations of Class A and Class B  stock that have been authorized by the board of directors of the Bank in  its capital plan. A Bank, in its discretion, may establish a lower  minimum investment for members that invest in Class B stock than is  required for members that invest in Class A stock, provided that such  reduced investment provides sufficient capital for the Bank to remain in  compliance with its minimum capital requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each member of a Bank shall at all times maintain an investment  in the capital stock of the Bank in an amount that is sufficient to  satisfy the minimum investment required for that   member in accordance with the Bank's capital plan.
