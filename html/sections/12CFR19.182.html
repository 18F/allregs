                            <p class="depth0">A formal investigation begins with the issuance of an order signed  by the Comptroller or the Comptroller's delegate. The order must  designate the person or persons who will conduct the investigation. Such  persons are authorized, among other things, to issue subpoenas duces  tecum, to administer oaths, and receive affirmations as to any matter  under investigation by the Comptroller. Upon application and for good  cause shown, the Comptroller may limit, modify, or withdraw the order at  any stage of the proceedings.</p>
