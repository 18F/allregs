                            <p class="depth0">Whether a nonresident alien individual who is a member of a  partnership is taxable in accordance with subsection (a), (b), or (c) of  section 871 may depend on the status of the partnership. A nonresident  alien individual who is a member of a partnership which is not engaged  in trade or business within the United States is subject to the  provisions of section 871 (a) or (b), as the case may be, depending on  whether or not he receives during the taxable year an aggregate of more  than $15,400 gross income described in section 871(a), if he is not  otherwise engaged in trade or business within the United States. A  nonresident alien individual who is a member of a partnership which at  any time within the taxable year is engaged in trade or business within  the United States is considered as being engaged in trade or business  within the United States and is therefore taxable under section 871(c).  For definition of what the term ``partnership'' includes, see section  7701(a)(2) and the regulations in part   301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). The  test of whether a partnership is engaged in trade or business within the  United States is the same as in the case of a nonresident alien  individual. See Sec. 1.871-8.</p>
