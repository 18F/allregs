(See Sec.  73.1570)</p><p class="depth0">Maximum rated carrier power. The maximum power at which the  transmitter can be operated satisfactorily and is determined by the  design of the transmitter and the type and number of vacuum tubes or  other amplifier devices used in the last radio stage.</p><p class="depth0">Model I facility. A station operating in the 1605-1705 kHz band  featuring fulltime operation with stereo, competitive technical quality,  10 kW daytime power, 1 kW nighttime power, non-directional antenna (or a  simple directional antenna system), and separated by 400-800 km from  other co-channel stations.</p><p class="depth0">Model II facility.
