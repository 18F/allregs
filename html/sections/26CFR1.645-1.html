                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If an election is filed for a qualified revocable  trust, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in accordance  with the rules set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the qualified  revocable trust is treated and taxed for purposes of subtitle A of the  Internal Revenue Code as part of its related estate, as defined in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section (and not as a separate trust) during  the election period, as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.  Rules regarding the use of taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) and  the filing of a Form 1041, ``U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and  Trusts,'' for a qualified revocable trust are in paragraph (d) of this  section. Rules regarding the tax treatment of an electing trust and  related estate and the general filing requirements for the combined  entity during the election period are in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section. Rules regarding the tax treatment of an electing trust and its  filing requirements during the election period if no executor, as  defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, is appointed for a related  estate are in paragraph   (e)(3) of this section. Rules for determining the duration of the  section 645 election period are in paragraph (f) of this section. Rules  regarding the tax effects of the termination of the election are in  paragraph (h) of this section. Rules regarding the tax consequences of  the appointment of an executor after a trustee has made a section 645  election believing that an executor would not be appointed for a related  estate are in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified revocable trust. A qualified revocable trust (QRT) is  any trust (or portion thereof) that on the date of death of the decedent  was treated as owned by the decedent under section 676 by reason of a  power held by the decedent (determined without regard to section  672(e)). A trust that was treated as owned by the decedent under section  676 by reason of a power that was exercisable by the decedent only with  the approval or consent of a nonadverse party or with the approval or  consent of the decedent's spouse is a QRT. A trust that was treated as  owned by the decedent under section 676 solely by reason of a power held  by a nonadverse party or by reason of a power held by the decedent's  spouse is not a QRT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Electing trust. An electing trust is a QRT for which a valid  section 645 election has been made. Once a section 645 election has been  made for the trust, the trust shall be treated as an electing trust  throughout the entire election period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decedent. The decedent is the individual who was treated as the  owner of the QRT under section 676 on the date of that individual's  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Related estate. A related estate is the estate of the decedent  who was treated as the owner of the QRT on the date of the decedent's  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Election period. The election period is the period of time  during which an electing trust is treated and taxed as part of its  related estate. The rules for determining the duration of the election  period are in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Filing the election if there is an executor-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time and manner for filing the election. If there is an executor of  the related estate, the trustees of each QRT joining in the election and  the executor of the related estate make an election under section 645  and this section to treat each QRT joining in the election as part of  the related estate for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue  Code by filing a form provided by the IRS for making the election  (election form) properly completed and signed under penalties of  perjury, or in any other manner prescribed after December 24, 2002 by  forms provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or by other  published guidance for making the election. For the election to be  valid, the election form must be filed not later than the time  prescribed under section 6072 for filing the Form 1041 for the first  taxable year of the related estate (regardless of whether there is  sufficient income to require the filing of that return). If an extension  is granted for the filing of the Form 1041 for the first taxable year of  the related estate, the election form will be timely filed if it is  filed by the time prescribed for filing the Form 1041 including the  extension granted with respect to the Form 1041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions to election. In addition to providing the  information required by the election form, as a condition to a valid  section 645 election, the trustee of each QRT joining in the election  and the executor of the related estate agree, by signing the election  form under penalties of perjury, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to a trustee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The trustee agrees to the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The trustee is responsible for timely providing the executor of  the related estate with all the trust information necessary to permit  the executor to file a complete, accurate, and timely Form 1041 for the  combined electing trust(s) and related estate for each taxable year  during the election period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The trustee of each QRT joining the election and the executor of  the related estate have agreed to allocate the tax burden of the  combined electing trust(s) and related estate for each taxable year  during the election period in a manner that reasonably reflects the tax  obligations of each electing trust and the related estate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The trustee is responsible for insuring that the electing  trust's share of the tax obligations of the combined electing trust(s)  and related estate is timely paid to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to the executor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The executor agrees to the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The executor is responsible for filing a complete, accurate, and  timely Form 1041 for the combined electing trust(s) and related estate  for each taxable year during the election period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The executor and the trustee of each QRT joining in the election  have agreed to allocate the tax burden of the combined electing trust(s)  and related estate for each taxable year during the election period in a  manner that reasonably reflects the tax obligations of each electing  trust and the related estate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The executor is responsible for insuring that the related  estate's share of the tax obligations of the combined electing trust(s)  and related estate is timely paid to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filing the election if there is no executor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time and manner  for filing the election. If there is no executor for a related estate,  an election to treat one or more QRTs of the decedent as an estate for  purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code is made by the  trustees of each QRT joining in the election, by filing a properly  completed election form, or in any other manner prescribed after  December 24, 2002 by forms provided by the IRS, or by other published  guidance for making the election. For the election to be valid, the  election form must be filed not later than the time prescribed under  section 6072 for filing the Form 1041 for the first taxable year of the  trust, taking into account the trustee's election to treat the trust as  an estate under section 645 (regardless of whether there is sufficient  income to require the filing of that return). If an extension is granted  for the filing of the Form 1041 for the first taxable year of the  electing trust, the election form will be timely filed if it is filed by  the time prescribed for filing the Form 1041 including the extension  granted with respect to the filing of the Form 1041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions to election. In addition to providing the  information required by the election form, as a condition to a valid  section 645 election, the trustee of each QRT joining in the election  agrees, by signing the election form under penalties of perjury, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The trustee agrees to the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If there is more than one QRT joining in the election, the  trustees of each QRT joining in the election have appointed one trustee  to be responsible for filing the Form 1041 for the combined electing  trusts for each taxable year during the election period (filing trustee)  and the filing trustee has agreed to accept that responsibility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If there is more than one QRT, the trustees of each QRT joining  in the election have agreed to allocate the tax liability of the  combined electing trusts for each taxable year during the election  period in a manner that reasonably reflects the tax obligations of each  electing trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The trustee agrees to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timely file a Form 1041 for the electing trust(s) for each  taxable year during the election period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If there is more than one QRT and the trustee is not the filing  trustee, timely provide the filing trustee with all of the electing  trust's information necessary to permit the filing trustee to file a  complete, accurate, and timely Form 1041 for the combined electing  trusts for each taxable year during the election period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insure that the electing trust's share of the tax burden is  timely paid to the Secretary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> There is no executor and, to the knowledge and belief of the  trustee, one will not be appointed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If an executor is appointed after the filing of the election  form and the executor agrees to the section 645 election, the trustee  will complete and file a revised election form with the executor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election for more than one QRT. If there is more than one QRT,  the election may be made for some or all of the QRTs. If there is no  executor, one trustee must be appointed by the trustees of the electing  trusts to file Forms 1041 for the combined electing trusts filing as an  estate during the election period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> TIN and filing requirements for a QRT--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Obtaining a TIN.  Regardless of whether there is an executor for a related estate and  regardless of whether a section 645 election will be made for the QRT, a  TIN must be obtained for the QRT following the death of the decedent.  See Sec. 301.6109-1(a)(3) of this chapter. The trustee must furnish  this TIN to the payors of the QRT. See Sec. 301.6109-1(a)(5) of this  chapter for the definition of payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filing a Form 1041 for a QRT--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Option not to file a Form 1041  for a QRT for which a section 645 election will be made. If a section  645 election will be made for a QRT, the executor of the related estate,  if any, and the trustee of the QRT may treat the QRT as an electing  trust from the decedent's date of death until the due date for the  section 645 election. Accordingly, the trustee of the QRT is not  required to file a Form 1041 for the QRT for the short taxable year  beginning with the decedent's date of death and ending December 31 of  that year. However, if a QRT is treated as an electing trust under this  paragraph from the decedent's date of death until the due date for the  section 645 election but a valid section 645 election is not made for  the QRT, the QRT will be subject to penalties and interest for failing  to timely file a Form 1041 and pay the tax due thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirement to file a Form 1041 for a QRT if paragraph  (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requirement to file Form  1041. If the trustee of the QRT and the executor of the related estate,  if any, do not treat the QRT as an electing trust as provided under  paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or if the trustee of the electing  trust and the executor, if any, are uncertain whether a section 645  election will be made for a QRT, the trustee of the QRT must file a Form  1041 for the short taxable year beginning with the decedent's death and  ending December 31 of that year (unless the QRT is not required to file  a Form 1041 under section 6012 for this period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requirement to amend Form 1041 if a section 645 election is  made--(1) If there is an executor. If there is an executor and a valid  section 645 election is made for a QRT after a Form 1041 has been filed  for the QRT as a trust (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section),  the trustee must amend the Form 1041. The QRT's items of income,  deduction, and credit must be excluded from the amended Form 1041 filed  under this paragraph and must be included on the Form 1041 filed for the  first taxable year of the combined electing trust and related estate  under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(A)</em> of this section) for  the short taxable year beginning with the decedent's death and ending  December 31 of that year, the trustee must file an amended return for  the QRT. The amended return must be filed consistent with paragraph  (e)(3) of this section and must be filed by the due date of the Form  1041 for the QRT, taking into account the trustee's election under  section 645.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tax treatment and general filing requirements of electing trust  and related estate during the election period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effect of election.  The section 645 election once made is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the subchapter S shareholder requirements of section  1361(b)(1), and the special offset for rental real estate activities in  section 469</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Filing the Form 1041 for the combined  electing trust and related estate during the election period. If there  is an executor, the executor files a single income tax return annually  (assuming a return is required under section 6012) under the name and  TIN of the related estate for the combined electing trust and the  related estate. Information regarding the name and TIN of each electing  trust must be provided on the Form 1041 as required by the instructions  to that form. The period of limitations provided in section 6501 for  assessments with respect to an electing trust and the related estate  starts with the filing of the return required under this paragraph.  Except as required under the separate share rules of section 663(c), for  purposes of filing the Form 1041 under this paragraph and computing the  tax, the items of income, deduction, and credit of the electing trust  and related estate are combined. One personal exemption in the amount of  $600 is permitted under section 642(b), and the tax is computed under  section 1(e), taking into account section 1(h), for the combined taxable  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section, if there is an executor, the trustee of  the electing trust does not file a Form 1041 for the electing trust  during the election period. Although the trustee is not required to file  a Form 1041 for the electing trust, the trustee of the electing trust  must timely provide the executor of the related estate with all the  trust information necessary to permit the executor to file a complete,  accurate and timely Form 1041 for the combined electing trust and  related estate. The trustee must also insure that the electing trust's  share of the tax obligations of the combined electing trust and related  estate is timely paid to the Secretary. In certain situations, the  trustee of a QRT may be required to file a Form 1041 for the QRT's short  taxable year beginning with the date of the decedent's death and ending  December 31 of that year. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of the separate share rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Distributions to  beneficiaries (other than to a share (or shares) of the combined  electing trust and related estate). Under the separate share rules of  section 663(c), the electing trust and related estate are treated as  separate shares for purposes of computing distributable net income (DNI)  and applying the distribution provisions of sections 661 and 662.  Further, the electing trust share or the related estate share may each  contain two or more shares. Thus, if during the taxable year, a  distribution is made by the electing trust or the related estate, the  DNI of the share making the distribution must be determined and the  distribution provisions of sections 661 and 662 must be applied using  the separately determined DNI applicable to the distributing share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A's will provides that, after the payment of debts,  expenses, and taxes, the residue of A's estate is to be distributed to  Trust, an electing trust. The sole beneficiary of Trust is C. The estate  share has $15,000 of gross income, $5,000 of deductions, and $10,000 of  taxable income and DNI for the taxable year based on the assets held in  A's   estate. During the taxable year, A's estate distributes $15,000 to  Trust. The distribution reduces the DNI of the estate share by $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the same taxable year, the trust share has $25,000 of gross  income and $5,000 of deductions. None of the modifications provided for  under section 643(a) apply. In calculating the DNI for the trust share,  the gross income of the trust share is increased by $10,000, the amount  of the reduction in the DNI of the estate share as a result of the  distribution to Trust. Thus, solely for purposes of calculating DNI, the  trust share has gross income of $35,000, and taxable income of $30,000.  Therefore, the trust share has $30,000 of DNI for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During the same taxable year, Trust distributes $35,000 to C.  The distribution deduction reported on the Form 1041 filed for A's  estate and Trust is $30,000. As a result of the distribution by Trust to  C, C must include $30,000 in gross income for the taxable year. The  gross income reported on the Form 1041 filed for A's estate and Trust is  $40,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Application of the governing instrument requirement of section  642(c). A deduction is allowed in computing the taxable income of the  combined electing trust and related estate to the extent permitted under  section 642(c) for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any amount of the gross income of the related estate that is  paid or set aside during the taxable year pursuant to the terms of the  governing instrument of the related estate for a purpose specified in  section 170(c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any amount of gross income of the electing trust that is paid or  set aside during the taxable year pursuant to the terms of the governing  instrument of the electing trust for a purpose specified in section  170(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If there is no executor--(i) Tax treatment of the electing  trust. If there is no executor, the trustee treats the electing trust,  during the election period, as an estate for all purposes of subtitle A  of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, an electing trust is  treated as an estate for purposes of the set-aside deduction under  section 642(c)(2), the subchapter S shareholder requirements of section  1361(b)(1), and the special offset for rental real estate activities  under section 469</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(4)</em>. The trustee may also adopt a taxable year other  than a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section) under the name and TIN of the electing  trust of the filing trustee. Information regarding the names and TINs of  the other electing trusts must be provided on the Form 1041 as required  by the instructions to that form. Any return filed in accordance with  this paragraph shall be treated as a return filed for the electing trust  (or trusts, if there is more than one electing trust) and not as a  return filed for any subsequently discovered related estate.  Accordingly, the period of limitations provided in section 6501 for  assessments with respect to a subsequently discovered related estate  does not start until a return is filed with respect to the related  estate. See paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of the section 6654(l)(2) to the electing trust.  Each electing trust and related estate (if any) is treated as a separate  taxpayer for all purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code,  including, without limitation, the application of section 6654. The  provisions of section 6654(l)(2)(A) relating to the two year exception  to an estate's obligation to make estimated tax payments, however, will  apply to each electing trust for which a section 645 election has been  made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Duration of election period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The election period  begins on the date of the decedent's death and terminates on the earlier  of the day on which both the electing trust and related estate, if any,  have distributed all of their assets, or the day before the applicable  date. The election does not apply to successor trusts (trusts that are  distributees under the trust instrument).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of applicable date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicable date if no Form  706 ``United States Estate (and Generation Skipping Transfer) Tax  Return'' is required to be filed. If a Form 706 is not required to be  filed as a result of the decedent's death, the applicable date is the  day   which is 2 years after the date of the decedent's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable date if a Form 706 is required to be filed. If a  Form 706 is required to be filed as a result of the decedent's death,  the applicable date is the later of the day that is 2 years after the  date of the decedent's death, or the day that is 6 months after the date  of final determination of liability for estate tax. Solely for purposes  of determining the applicable date under section 645, the date of final  determination of liability is the earliest of the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date that is six months after the issuance by the Internal  Revenue Service of an estate tax closing letter, unless a claim for  refund with respect to the estate tax is filed within twelve months  after the issuance of the letter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date of a final disposition of a claim for refund, as  defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, that resolves the  liability for the estate tax, unless suit is instituted within six  months after a final disposition of the claim;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date of execution of a settlement agreement with the  Internal Revenue Service that determines the liability for the estate  tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date of issuance of a decision, judgment, decree, or other  order by a court of competent jurisdiction resolving the liability for  the estate tax unless a notice of appeal or a petition for certiorari is  filed within 90 days after the issuance of a decision, judgment, decree,  or other order of a court; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The date of expiration of the period of limitations for  assessment of the estate tax provided in section 6501.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of final disposition of claim for refund. For  purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a claim for refund  shall be deemed finally disposed of by the Secretary when all items have  been either allowed or disallowed. If a waiver of notification with  respect to disallowance is filed with respect to a claim for refund  prior to disallowance of the claim, the claim for refund will be treated  as disallowed on the date the waiver is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (f)(2) is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A died on October 20, 2002. The executor of A's estate  and the trustee of Trust, an electing trust, made a section 645  election. A Form 706 is not required to be filed as a result of A's  death. The applicable date is October 20, 2004, the day that is two  years after A's date of death. The last day of the election period is  October 19, 2004. Beginning October 20, 2004, Trust will no longer be  treated and taxed as part of A's estate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that a Form  706 is required to be filed as the result of A's death. The Internal  Revenue Service issues an estate tax closing letter accepting the Form  706 as filed on March 15, 2005. The estate does not file a claim for  refund by March 15, 2006, the day that is twelve months after the date  of issuance of the estate tax closing letter. The date of final  determination of liability is September 15, 2005, and the applicable  date is March 15, 2006. The last day of the election period is March 14,  2006. Beginning March 15, 2006, Trust will no longer be treated and  taxed as part of A's estate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that a Form  706 is required to be filed as the result of A's death. The Form 706 is  audited, and a notice of deficiency authorized under section 6212 is  mailed to the executor of A's estate as a result of the audit. The  executor files a petition in Tax Court. The Tax Court issues a decision  resolving the liability for estate tax on December 14, 2005, and neither  party appeals within 90 days after the issuance of the decision. The  date of final determination of liability is December 14, 2005. The  applicable date is June 14, 2006, the day that is six months after the  date of final determination of liability. The last day of the election  period is June 13, 2006. Beginning June 14, 2006, Trust will no longer  be treated and taxed as part of A's estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Executor appointed after the section 645 election is made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Effect on the election. If an executor for the related estate is not  appointed until after the trustee has made a valid section 645 election,  the executor must agree to the trustee's election, and the IRS must be  notified of that agreement by the filing of a revised election form  (completed as required by the instructions to that form) within 90 days  of the appointment of the executor, for the election period to continue  past the date of appointment of the executor. If the executor does not  agree to the election or a revised election form is not timely filed as  required by this paragraph, the election period terminates the day  before the appointment of the   executor. If the IRS issues other guidance after December 24, 2002 for  notifying the IRS of the executor's agreement to the election, the IRS  must be notified in the manner provided in that guidance for the  election period to continue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuation of election period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Correction of returns filed  before executor appointed. If the election period continues under  paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the executor of the related estate and  the trustee of each electing trust must file amended Forms 1041 to  correct the Forms 1041 filed by the trustee before the executor was  appointed. The amended Forms 1041 must be filed under the name and TIN  of the electing trust and must reflect the items of income, deduction,  and credit of the related estate and the electing trust.

A trust  to which section 651 applies is referred to in this part as a ``simple''  trust. Trusts subject to section 661 are referred to as ``complex''  trusts. A trust may be a simple trust for one year and a complex trust  for another year. It should be noted that under section 651 a trust  qualifies as a simple trust in a taxable year in which it is required to  distribute all its income currently and makes no other distributions,  whether or not distributions of current income are in fact made. On the  other hand a trust is not a complex trust by reason of distributions of  amounts other than income unless such distributions are in fact made  during the taxable year, whether or not they are required in that year.     Sec. 1.651(a)-2  Income required to be distributed currently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The determination of whether trust income is required to be  distributed currently depends upon the terms of the trust instrument and  the applicable local law. For this purpose, if the trust instrument  provides that the trustee in determining the distributable income shall  first retain a reserve for depreciation or otherwise make due allowance  for keeping the trust corpus intact by retaining a reasonable amount of  the current income for that purpose, the retention of current income for  that purpose will not disqualify the trust from being a ``simple''  trust. The fiduciary must be under a duty to distribute the income  currently even if, as a matter of practical necessity, the income is not  distributed until after the close of the trust's taxable year. For  example: Under the terms of the trust instrument, all of the income is  currently distributable to A. The trust reports on the calendar year  basis and as a matter of practical necessity makes distribution to A of  each quarter's income on the fifteenth day of the month following the  close of the quarter. The distribution made by the trust on January 15,  1955, of the income for the fourth quarter of 1954 does not disqualify  the trust from treatment in 1955 under section 651, since the income is  required to be distributed currently. However, if the terms of a trust  require that none of the income be distributed until after the year of  its receipt by the trust, the income of the trust is not required to be  distributed currently and the trust is not a simple trust. For  definition of the term ``income'' see section 643(b) and Sec. 1.643(b)- 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> It is immaterial, for purposes of determining whether all the  income is required to be distributed currently, that the amount of  income allocated to a particular beneficiary is not specified in the  instrument. For example, if the fiduciary is required to distribute all  the income currently, but has discretion to ``sprinkle'' the income  among a class of beneficiaries, or among named beneficiaries, in such  amount as he may see fit, all the income is required to be distributed  currently, even though the amount distributable to a particular  beneficiary is unknown until the fiduciary has exercised his discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If in one taxable year of a trust its income for that year is  required or permitted to be accumulated, and in another taxable year its  income for the year is required to be distributed currently (and no  other amounts are distributed), the trust is a simple trust for the  latter year. For example, a trust under which income may be accumulated  until a beneficiary is 21 years old, and thereafter must be distributed  currently, is a simple trust for taxable years beginning after the  beneficiary reaches the age of 21 years in which no other amounts are  distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> applies  for taxable years of trusts ending after January 2, 2004.

For example, a  trust which is required to distribute all of its income currently would  not qualify as a simple trust under section 651 in the year of its  termination since in that year actual distributions of corpus would be  made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A trust, otherwise qualifying under section 651, which may make  a distribution of corpus in the discretion of the trustee, or which is  required under the terms of its governing instrument to make a  distribution of corpus upon the happening of a specified   event, will be disqualified for treatment under section 651 only for the  taxable year in which an actual distribution of corpus is made. For  example: Under the terms of a trust, which is required to distribute all  of its income currently, half of the corpus is to be distributed to  beneficiary A when he becomes 30 years of age. The trust reports on the  calendar year basis. On December 28, 1954, A becomes 30 years of age and  the trustee distributes half of the corpus of the trust to him on  January 3, 1955. The trust will be disqualified for treatment under  section 651 only for the taxable year 1955, the year in which an actual  distribution of corpus is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>.

Therefore, a trust with a remainder to a  charitable organization is not disqualified for treatment as a simple  trust if either (a) the remainder is subject to a contingency, so that  no deduction would be allowed for capital gains or other amounts added  to corpus as amounts permanently set aside for a charitable, etc.,  purpose under section 642 (c), or (b) the trust receives no capital  gains or other income added to corpus for the taxable year for which  such a deduction would be allowed.

Sec. 1.651(b)-1  Deduction for distributions to beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">In computing its taxable income, a simple trust is allowed a  deduction for the amount of income which is required under the terms of  the trust instrument to be distributed currently to beneficiaries. If  the amount of income required to be distributed currently exceeds the  distributable net income, the deduction allowable to the trust is  limited to the amount of the distributable net income. For this purpose  the amount of income required to be distributed currently, or  distributable net income, whichever is applicable, does not include  items of trust income (adjusted for deductions allocable thereto) which  are not included in the gross income of the trust. For determination of  the character of the income required to be distributed currently, see  Sec. 1.652(b)-2. Accordingly, for the purposes of determining the  deduction allowable to the trust under section 651, distributable net  income is computed without the modifications specified in paragraphs  (5), (6), and (7) of section 643(a), relating to tax-exempt interest,  foreign income, and excluded dividends. For example: Assume that the  distributable net income of a trust as computed under section 643(a)  amounts to $99,000 but includes nontaxable income of $9,000. Then  distributable net income for the purpose of determining the deduction  allowable under section 651 is $90,000 ($99,000 less $9,000 nontaxable  income).    Sec. 1.652(a)-1  Simple trusts; inclusion of amounts in income of beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">Subject to the rules in Sec. Sec. 1.652(a)-2 and 1.652(b)-1, a  beneficiary of a simple trust includes in his gross income for the  taxable year the amounts of income required to be distributed to him for  such year, whether or not distributed. Thus, the income of a simple  trust is includible in the beneficiary's gross income for the taxable  year in which the income is required to be distributed currently even  though, as a matter of practical necessity, the income is not  distributed until after the close of the taxable year of the trust. See  Sec. 1.642(a)(3)-2 with respect to time of receipt of dividends. See  Sec. 1.652(c)-1 for treatment of amounts required to be distributed  where a beneficiary and the trust have different taxable years. The term  income required to be distributed currently includes income required to  be distributed currently which is in fact used to discharge or satisfy  any person's legal obligation as that term is used in Sec. 1.662(a)-4.     Sec. 1.652(a)-2  Distributions in excess of distributable net income.</p><p class="depth0">If the amount of income required to be distributed currently to  beneficiaries exceeds the distributable net income of the trust (as  defined in section 643(a)), each beneficiary includes in his gross  income an amount equivalent to his proportionate share of such  distributable net income. Thus, if beneficiary A is to receive two- thirds of the trust income and B is to receive one-third, and the income  required to be distributed currently is $99,000, A will receive $66,000  and B, $33,000. However, if the distributable net income, as determined  under section 643(a) is only $90,000, A will include two-thirds  ($60,000) of that sum in his gross income, and B will include one-third  ($30,000) in his gross income. See Sec. Sec. 1.652(b)-1 and 1.652(b)-2,  however, for amounts which are not includible in the gross income of a  beneficiary because of their tax-exempt character.    Sec. 1.652(b)-1  Character of amounts.</p><p class="depth0">In determining the gross income of a beneficiary, the amounts  includible under Sec. 1.652(a)-1 have the same character in the hands  of the beneficiary as in the hands of the trust. For example, to the  extent that the amounts specified in Sec. 1.652(a)-1 consist of income  exempt from tax under section 103, such amounts are not included in the  beneficiary's gross income. Similarly, dividends distributed to a  beneficiary retain their original character in the beneficiary's hands  for purposes of determining the availability to the beneficiary of the  dividends received credit under section 34 (for dividends received on or  before December 31, 1964) and the dividend exclusion under section 116.  Also, to the extent that the amounts specified in Sec. 1.652(a)-1  consist of ``earned income'' in the hands of the trust under the  provisions of section 1348 such amount shall be treated under section  1348 as ``earned income'' in the hands of the beneficiary. Similarly, to  the extent such amounts consist of an amount received as a part of a  lump sum distribution from a qualified plan and to which the provisions  of section 72(n) would apply in the hands of the trust, such amount  shall be treated as subject to such section in the hands of the  beneficiary except where such amount is deemed under section 666(a) to  have been distributed in a preceding taxable year of the trust and the  partial tax described in section 668(a)(2) is determined under section  668(b)(1)(B). The tax treatment of amounts determined under Sec.  1.652(a)-1 depends upon the beneficiary's status with respect to them  not upon the status of the trust. Thus, if a beneficiary is deemed to  have received foreign income of a foreign trust, the includibility of  such income in his gross income depends upon his taxable status with  respect to that income.  [T.D. 7204, 37 FR 17134, Aug. 25, 1972]    Sec. 1.652(b)-2  Allocation of income items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a))</em> as  the total of each class bears to such distributable net income, unless  the terms of the trust specifically allocate different classes of income  to different beneficiaries, or unless local law requires such an  allocation. For example: Assume that under the terms of the governing  instrument, beneficiary A is to receive currently one-half of the trust  income and beneficiaries B and C are each to receive currently one- quarter, and the distributable net income of the trust (after allocation  of expenses) consists of dividends of $10,000, taxable interest of  $10,000, and tax-exempt interest of $4,000. A will be deemed to have  received $5,000 of dividends, $5,000 of taxable interest, and $2,000 of  tax-exempt interest; B and C will each be deemed to have received $2,500  of dividends, $2,500 of taxable interest, and $1,000 of tax-exempt  interest. However, if the terms of the trust specifically allocate  different classes of income to different beneficiaries, entirely or in  part, or if local law requires such an allocation, each beneficiary will  be deemed to have received those items of income specifically allocated  to him.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The terms of the trust are considered specifically to allocate  different   classes of income to different beneficiaries only to the extent that the  allocation is required in the trust instrument, and only to the extent  that it has an economic effect independent of the income tax  consequences of the allocation. For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocation pursuant to a provision in a trust instrument  granting the trustee discretion to allocate different classes of income  to different beneficiaries is not a specific allocation by the terms of  the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation pursuant to a provision directing the trustee to pay  all of one income to A, or $10,000 out of the income to A, and the  balance of the income to B, but directing the trustee first to allocate  a specific class of income to A's share (to the extent there is income  of that class and to the extent it does not exceed A's share) is not a  specific allocation by the terms of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation pursuant to a provision directing the trustee to pay  half the class of income (whatever it may be) to A, and the balance of  the income to B, is a specific allocation by the terms of the trust.    Sec. 1.652(b)-3  Allocation of deductions.</p><p class="depth0">Items of deduction of a trust that enter into the computation of  distributable net income are to be allocated among the items of income  in accordance with the following principles:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All deductible items directly attributable to one class of  income (except dividends excluded under section 116) are allocated  thereto. For example, repairs to, taxes on, and other expenses directly  attributable to the maintenance of rental property or the collection of  rental income are allocated to rental income. See Sec. 1.642(e)-1 for  treatment of depreciation of rental property. Similarly, all  expenditures directly attributable to a business carried on by a trust  are allocated to the income from such business. If the deductions  directly attributable to a particular class of income exceed that  income, the excess is applied against other classes of income in the  manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The deductions which are not directly attributable to a specific  class of income may be allocated to any item of income (including  capital gains) included in computing distributable net income, but a  portion must be allocated to nontaxable income (except dividends  excluded under section 116) pursuant to section 265 and the regulations  thereunder. For example, if the income of a trust is $30,000 (after  direct expenses), consisting equally of $10,000 of dividends, tax-exempt  interest, and rents, and income commissions amount to $3,000, one-third  ($1,000) of such commissions should be allocated to tax-exempt interest,  but the balance of $2,000 may be allocated to the rents or dividends in  such proportions as the trustee may elect. The fact that the governing  instrument or applicable local law treats certain items of deduction as  attributable to corpus or to income not included in distributable net  income does not affect allocation under this paragraph. For instance, if  in the example set forth in this paragraph the trust also had capital  gains which are allocable to corpus under the terms of the trust  instrument, no part of the deductions would be allocable thereto since  the capital gains are excluded from the computation of distributable net  income under section 643(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples of expenses which are considered as not directly  attributable to a specific class of income are trustee's commissions,  the rental of safe deposit boxes, and State income and personal property  taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> To the extent that any items of deduction which are directly  attributable to a class of income exceed that class of income, they may  be allocated to any other class of income (including capital gains)  included in distributable net income in the manner provided in paragraph  (b) of this section, except that any excess deductions attributable to  tax-exempt income (other than dividends excluded under section 116) may  not be offset against any other class of income. See section 265 and the  regulations thereunder. Thus, if the trust has rents, taxable interest,  dividends, and tax-exempt interest, and the deductions directly  attributable to the rents exceed the rental income, the excess may be  allocated to the taxable   interest or dividends in such proportions as the fiduciary may elect.  However, if the excess deductions are attributable to the tax-exempt  interest, they may not be allocated to either the rents, taxable  interest, or dividends.    Sec. 1.652(c)-1  Different taxable years.</p><p class="depth0">If a beneficiary has a different taxable year (as defined in section  441 or 442) from the taxable year of the trust, the amount he is  required to include in gross income in accordance with section 652 (a)  and (b) is based on the income of the trust for any taxable year or  years ending with or within his taxable year. This rule applies to  taxable years of normal duration as well as to so-called short taxable  years. Income of the trust for its taxable year or years is determined  in accordance with its method of accounting and without regard to that  of the beneficiary.    Sec. 1.652(c)-2  Death of individual beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">If income is required to be distributed currently to a beneficiary,  by a trust for a taxable year which does not end with or within the last  taxable year of a beneficiary (because of the beneficiary's death), the  extent to which the income is included in the gross income of the  beneficiary for his last taxable year or in the gross income of his  estate is determined by the computations under section 652 for the  taxable year of the trust in which his last taxable year ends. Thus, the  distributable net income of the taxable year of the trust determines the  extent to which the income required to be distributed currently to the  beneficiary is included in his gross income for his last taxable year or  in the gross income of his estate. (Section 652(c) does not apply to  such amounts.) The gross income for the last taxable year of a  beneficiary on the cash basis includes only income actually distributed  to the beneficiary before his death. Income required to be distributed,  but in fact distributed to his estate, is included in the gross income  of the estate as income in respect of a decedent under section 691. See  paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.663(c)-3 with respect to separate share  treatment for the periods before and after the decedent's death. If the  trust does not qualify as a simple trust for the taxable year of the  trust in which the last taxable year of the beneficiary ends, see  section 662(c) and Sec. 1.662(c)-2.

The phrase the amount of income for the taxable year required to   be distributed currently also includes any amount required to be paid  during the taxable year in all events (either out of income or corpus)  pursuant to a court order or decree or under local law, by a decedent's  estate as an allowance or award for the support of the decedent's widow  or other dependent for a limited period during the administration of the  estate to the extent there is income (as defined in section 643(b)) of  the estate for the taxable year not paid, credited, or required to be  distributed to other beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If an annuity is paid, credited, or required to be distributed  tax free, that is, under a provision whereby the executor or trustee  will pay the income tax of the annuitant resulting from the receipt of  the annuity, the payment of or for the tax by the executor or trustee  will be treated as income paid, credited, or required to be distributed  currently to the extent it is made out of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The application of the rules stated in this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that under the terms of the trust instrument  $5,000 is to be paid to X charity out of income each year; that $20,000  of income is currently distributable to A; and that an annuity of  $12,000 is to be paid to B out of income or corpus. All expenses are  charges against income and capital gains are allocable to corpus. During  the taxable year the trust had income of $30,000 (after the payment of  expenses) derived from taxable interest and made the payments to X  charity and distributions to A and B as required by the governing  instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amounts treated as distributed currently under section  662(a)(1) total $25,000 ($20,000 to A and $5,000 to B).

The distributable net income of the  trust computed under section 643(a) without taking into consideration  the charitable contributions deduction of $5,000 as provided by section  661(a)(1), is $30,000. Since the amounts treated as distributed  currently of $25,000 do not exceed the distributable net income (as  modified) of $30,000, A is required to include $20,000 in his gross  income and B is required to include $5,000 in his gross income under  section 662(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The amounts treated  as distributed currently under section 662(a)(1) total $25,000 ($20,000  to A and $5,000 to B), since trust income under section 643(b) remains  the same as in example 1. Distributable net income of the trust computed  under section 643(a) but without taking into account the charitable  contributions deduction of $5,000 as provided by section 662(a)(1) is  only $20,000. Since the amounts treated as distributed currently of  $25,000 exceed the distributable net income (as so computed) of $20,000,  A is required to include $16,000 (20,000/25,000 of $20,000) in his gross  income and B is required to include $4,000 (5,000/25,000 of $20,000) in  his gross income under section 662(a)(1). Because A and B are  beneficiaries of amounts of income required to be distributed currently,  they do not benefit from the reduction of distributable net income by  the charitable contributions deduction.

The term legal  obligation includes a legal obligation to support another person if, and  only if, the obligation is not affected by the adequacy of the  dependent's own resources. For example, a parent has a ``legal  obligation'' within the meaning of the preceding sentence to support his  minor child if under local law property or income from property owned by  the child cannot be used for his support so long as his parent is able  to support him. On the other hand, if under local law a mother may use  the resources of a child for the child's support in lieu of supporting  him herself, no obligation of support exists within the meaning of this  paragraph, whether or not income is actually used for support.  Similarly, since under local law a child ordinarily is obligated to  support his parent only if the parent's earnings and resources are  insufficient for the purpose, no obligation exists whether or not the  parent's earnings and resources are sufficient. In any event the amount  of trust income which is included in the gross income of a person  obligated to support a dependent is limited by the extent of his legal  obligation under local law. In the case of a parent's obligation to  support his child, to the extent that the parent's legal obligation of  support, including education, is determined under local law by the  family's station in life   and by the means of the parent, it is to be determined without  consideration of the trust income in question.

Sec. 1.662(a)-1 through 1.662(a)-4 shall have the same character  in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust.  The amounts are treated as consisting of the same proportion of each  class of items entering into the computation of distributable net income  as the total of each class bears to the total distributable net income  of the estate or trust unless the terms of the governing instrument  specifically allocate different classes of income to different  beneficiaries, or unless local law requires such an allocation. For this  purpose, the principles contained in Sec. 1.652(b)-1 shall apply.

Sec. 1.652(b)-1 and 1.662(b)-1 generally apply. However, before  the allocation of other deductions among the items of distributable net  income, the charitable contributions deduction allowed under section  642(c) is (in the absence of specific allocation under the terms of the  governing instrument or the requirement under local law of a different  allocation) allocated among the classes of income entering into the  computation of estate or trust income in accordance with the rules set  forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.643(a)-5. In the application of the  preceding sentence, for the purpose of allocating items of income and  deductions to beneficiaries to whom income is required to be distributed  currently, the amount of the charitable contributions deduction is  disregarded to the extent that it exceeds the income of the trust for  the taxable year reduced by amounts for the taxable year required to be  distributed currently. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples (of which example (1) is  illustrative of the preceding sentence):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A trust instrument provides that $30,000 of its  income must be distributed currently to A, and the balance may either be  distributed to B, distributed to a designated charity, or accumulated.

The net income of a trust is payable to A for life, with  the remainder to a charitable organization. Under the terms of the trust  instrument and local law capital gains are added to corpus. During the  taxable year the trust receives dividends of $10,000 and realized a  long-term capital gain of $10,000, for which a long-term capital gain  deduction of $5,000 is allowed under section 1202. Since under the trust  instrument and local law the capital gains are allocated to the  charitable organization, and since the capital gain deduction is  directly attributable to the capital gain, the charitable contributions  deduction and the capital gain deduction are both allocable to the  capital gain, and dividends in the amount of $10,000 are allocable to A.

This rule  applies as to so-called short taxable years as well as taxable years of  normal duration. Income of an estate or trust for its taxable year or  years is determined in accordance with its method of accounting and  without regard to that of the beneficiary.

Thus, the distributable net  income and the amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed for  the taxable year of the estate or trust, determine the extent to which  the amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the  beneficiary are included in his gross income for his last taxable year  or in the gross income of his estate. (Section 662(c) does not apply to  such amounts.) The gross income for the last taxable year of a  beneficiary on the cash basis includes only income actually distributed  to the beneficiary before his death. Income required to be distributed,  but in fact distributed to his estate, is included in the gross income  of the estate as income in respect of a decedent under section 691.

A gift or bequest of a specific sum of money or of  specific property, which is required by the specific terms of the will  or trust instrument and is properly paid or credited to a beneficiary,  is not allowed as a deduction to an estate or trust under section 661  and is not included in the gross income of a beneficiary under section  662, unless under the terms of the will or trust instrument the gift or  bequest is to be paid or credited to the recipient in more than three  installments. Thus, in order for a gift or bequest to be excludable from  the gross income of the recipient, (1) it must qualify as a gift or  bequest of a specific sum of money or of specific property (see  paragraph (b) of this section), and (2) the terms of the governing  instrument must not provide for its payment in more than three  installments (see paragraph (c) of this section). The date when the  estate came into existence or the date when the trust was created is  immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of a gift or bequest of a specific sum of money or of  specific property. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In order to qualify as a gift or bequest of a  specific sum of money or of specific property under section   663(a), the amount of money or the identity of the specific property  must be ascertainable under the terms of a testator's will as of the  date of his death, or under the terms of an inter vivos trust instrument  as of the date of the inception of the trust. For example, bequests to a  decedent's son of the decedent's interest in a partnership and to his  daughter of a sum of money equal to the value of the partnership  interest are bequests of specific property and of a specific sum of  money, respectively. On the other hand, a bequest to the decedent's  spouse of money or property, to be selected by the decedent's executor,  equal in value to a fraction of the decedent's ``adjusted gross estate''  is neither a bequest of a specific sum of money or of specific property.  The identity of the property and the amount of money specified in the  preceding sentence are dependent both on the exercise of the executor's  discretion and on the payment of administration expenses and other  charges, neither of which are facts existing on the date of the  decedent's death. It is immaterial that the value of the bequest is  determinable after the decedent's death before the bequest is satisfied  (so that gain or loss may be realized by the estate in the transfer of  property in satisfaction of it).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following amounts are not considered as gifts or bequests of  a sum of money or of specific property within the meaning of this  paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount which can be paid or credited only from the income of  an estate or trust, whether from the income for the year of payment or  crediting, or from the income accumulated from a prior year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An annuity, or periodic gifts of specific property in lieu of  or having the effect of an annuity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A residuary estate or the corpus of a trust; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A gift or bequest paid in a lump sum or in not more than three  installments, if the gift or bequest is required to be paid in more than  three installments under the terms of the governing instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed  that the gift or bequest is not required to be made in more than three  installments (see paragraph (c)):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under the terms of a will, a legacy of $5,000 was left to  A, 1,000 shares of X company stock was left to W, and the balance of the  estate was to be divided equally between W and B. No provision was made  in the will for the disposition of income of the estate during the  period of administration. The estate had income of $25,000 during the  taxable year 1954, which was accumulated and added to corpus for estate  accounting purposes. During the taxable year, the executor paid the  legacy of $5,000 in a lump sum to A, transferred the X company stock to  W, and made no other distributions to beneficiaries. The distributions  to A and W qualify for the exclusion under section 663(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Under the terms of a will, the testator's estate was to  be distributed to A. No provision was made in the will for the  distribution of the estate's income during the period of administration.  The estate had income of $50,000 for the taxable year. The estate  distributed to A stock with a basis of $40,000 and with a fair market  value of $40,000 on the date of distribution. No other distributions  were made during the year. The distribution does not qualify for the  exclusion under section 663(a)(1), because it is not a specific gift to  A required by the terms of the will. Accordingly, the fair market value  of the property ($40,000) represents a distribution within the meaning  of sections 661(a) and 662(a) (see Sec. 1.661(a)-2(c)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Under the terms of a trust instrument, trust income is to  be accumulated for a period of 10 years. During the eleventh year, the  trustee is to distribute $10,000 to B, payable from income or corpus,  and $10,000 to C, payable out of accumulated income. The trustee is to  distribute the balance of the accumulated income to A. Thereafter, A is  to receive all the current income until the trust terminates. Only the  distribution to B would qualify for the exclusion under section  663(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A gift or bequest of a specific sum of money or of specific  property is not disqualified under this paragraph solely because its  payment is subject to a condition. For example, provision for a payment  by a trust to beneficiary A of $10,000 when he reaches age 25, and  $10,000 when he reaches age 30, with payment over to B of any amount not  paid to A because of his death, is a gift to A of a specific sum of  money payable in two installments, within the meaning of this paragraph,  even though the exact amount payable to A cannot be   ascertained with certainty under the terms of the trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Installment payments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether a gift or  bequest of a specific sum of money or of specific property, as defined  in paragraph (b) of this section, is required to be paid or credited to  a particular beneficiary in more than three installments:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gifts or bequests of articles for personal use (such as personal  and household effects, automobiles, and the like) are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specifically devised real property, the title to which passes  directly from the decedent to the devisee under local law, is not taken  into account, since it would not constitute an amount paid, credited, or  required to be distributed under section 661 (see paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.661(a)-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All gifts and bequests under a decedent's will (which are not  disregarded pursuant to subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph)  for which no time of payment or crediting is specified, and which are to  be paid or credited in the ordinary course of administration of the  decedent's estate, are considered as required to be paid or credited in  a single installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All gifts and bequests (which are not disregarded pursuant to  subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) payable at any one  specified time under the terms of the governing instrument are taken  into account as a single installment.

The will also provides for the creation of a  trust for the benefit of A, under the terms of which there are required  to be distributed to A, $10,000 in cash and 100 shares of Y company  stock when he reaches 25 years of age, $25,000 in cash and 200 shares of  Y company stock when he reaches 30 years of age, and $50,000 in cash and  300 shares of Y company stock when he reaches 35 years of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The furniture, watch, automobile, and the farm are excluded in  determining whether any gift or bequest is required to be paid or  credited to A in more than three installments.

The $10,000 in cash and  shares of Y company stock required to be distributed by the trust to A  when he is 25 years old are considered as required to be paid or  distributed as one installment under the trust. Likewise, the  distributions to be made by the trust to A when he is 30 and 35 years  old are each considered as one installment under the trust. Since the  total number of installments to be made by the estate does not exceed  three, all of the items of money and property distributed by the estate  qualify for the exclusion under section 663(a)(1). Similarly, the three  distributions by the trust qualify.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that  another distribution of a specified sum of money is required to be made  by the trust to A when he becomes 40 years old. This distribution would  also qualify as an installment, thus making four installments in all  under the trust. None of the gifts to A under the trust would qualify  for the exclusion under section 663(a)(1). The situation as to the  estate, however, would not be changed.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). A trust instrument provides that A and B are each to  receive $75,000 in installments of $25,000, to be paid in alternate  years.

Any deduction or any loss which is  applicable solely to one separate share of the trust or estate is not  available to any other share of the same trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>-3  Applicability of separate share rule to certain trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The applicability of the separate share rule provided by section  663(c) to trusts other than qualified revocable trusts within the  meaning of section 645(b)(1) will generally depend upon whether  distributions of the trust are to be made in substantially the same  manner as if separate trusts had been created. Thus, if an instrument  directs a trustee to divide the testator's residuary estate into  separate shares (which under applicable law do not constitute separate  trusts) for each of the testator's children and the trustee is   given discretion, with respect to each share, to distribute or  accumulate income or to distribute principal or accumulated income, or  to do both, separate shares will exist under section 663(c). In  determining whether separate shares exist, it is immaterial whether the  principal and any accumulated income of each share is ultimately  distributable to the beneficiary of such share, to his descendants, to  his appointees under a general or special power of appointment, or to  any other beneficiaries (including a charitable organization) designated  to receive his share of the trust and accumulated income upon  termination of the beneficiary's interest in the share. Thus, a separate  share may exist if the instrument provides that upon the death of the  beneficiary of the share, the share will be added to the shares of the  other beneficiaries of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Separate share treatment will not be applied to a trust or  portion of a trust subject to a power to: (1) Distribute, apportion, or  accumulate income, or (2) distribute corpus to or for one or more  beneficiaries within a group or class of beneficiaries, unless payment  of income, accumulated income, or corpus of a share of one beneficiary  cannot affect the proportionate share of income, accumulated income, or  corpus of any shares of the other beneficiaries, or unless substantially  proper adjustment must thereafter be made (under the governing  instrument) so that substantially separate and independent shares exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A share may be considered as separate even though more than one  beneficiary has an interest in it. For example, two beneficiaries may  have equal, disproportionate, or indeterminate interests in one share  which is separate and independent from another share in which one or  more beneficiaries have an interest. Likewise, the same person may be a  beneficiary of more than one separate share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Separate share treatment may be given to a trust or portion of a  trust otherwise qualifying under this section if the trust or portion of  a trust is subject to a power to pay out to a beneficiary of a share (of  such trust or portion) an amount of corpus in excess of his  proportionate share of the corpus of the trust if the possibility of  exercise of the power is remote. For example, if the trust is subject to  a power to invade the entire corpus for the health, education, support,  or maintenance of A, separate share treatment is applied if exercise of  the power requires consideration of A's other income which is so  substantial as to make the possibility of exercise of the power remote.  If instead it appears that A and B have separate shares in a trust,  subject to a power to invade the entire corpus for the comfort,  pleasure, desire, or happiness of A, separate share treatment shall not  be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For taxable years ending before December 31, 1978, the separate  share rule may also be applicable to successive interests in point of  time, as for instance in the case of a trust providing for a life estate  to A and a second life estate or outright remainder to B. In such a  case, in the taxable year of a trust in which a beneficiary dies items  of income and deduction properly allocable under trust accounting  principles to the period before a beneficiary's death are attributed to  one share, and those allocable to the period after the beneficiary's  death are attributed to the other share. Separate share treatment is not  available to a succeeding interest, however, with respect to  distributions which would otherwise be deemed distributed in a taxable  year of the earlier interest under the throwback provisions of subpart D  (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the  Code. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A trust instrument directs that the income of a trust is to  be paid to A for her life. After her death income may be distributed to  B or accumulated. A dies on June 1, 1956. The trust keeps its books on  the basis of the calendar year. The trust instrument permits invasions  of corpus for the benefit of A and B, and an invasion of corpus was in  fact made for A's benefit in 1956. In determining the distributable net  income of the trust for the purpose of determining the amounts  includible in A's income, income and deductions properly allocable to  the period before A's death are treated as income and deductions of a  separate share; and for that purpose no account is taken of income   and deductions allocable to the period after A's death.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 7633, 44 FR 57926, Oct. 9, 1979; T.D. 8849, 64 FR 72543,  Dec. 28, 1999]    Sec. 1.663(c)-4  Applicability of separate share rule to estates and qualified revocable trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> is not a separate share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule for certain types of beneficial interests.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a  surviving spouse's elective share that under local law is determined as  of the date of the decedent's death and is not entitled to income or any  appreciation or depreciation is a separate share. Similarly,  notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a  pecuniary formula bequest that, under the terms of the governing  instrument or applicable local law, is not entitled to income or to  share in appreciation or depreciation constitutes a separate share if  the governing instrument does not provide that it is to be paid or  credited in more than three installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>-5  Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Section 663(c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A single trust was created in 1940 for the benefit of  A, B, and C, who were aged 6, 4, and 2, respectively. Under the terms of  the instrument, the trust income is required to be divided into three  equal shares. Each beneficiary's share of the income is to be  accumulated until he becomes 21 years of age. When a beneficiary reaches  the age of 21, his share of the income may thereafter be either  accumulated or distributed to him in the discretion of the trustee. The  trustee also has discretion to invade corpus for the benefit of any  beneficiary to the extent of his share of the trust estate, and the  trust instrument requires that the beneficiary's right to future income  and corpus will be proportionately reduced. When each beneficiary  reaches 35 years of age, his share of the trust estate shall be paid  over to him. The interest in the trust estate of any beneficiary dying  without issue and before he has attained the age of 35 is to be equally  divided between the other beneficiaries of the trust. All expenses of  the trust are allocable to income under the terms of the trust  instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No distributions of income or corpus were made by the trustee  prior to 1955, although A became 21 years of age on June 30, 1954.  During the taxable year of 1955, the trust has income from royalties of  $20,000 and expenses of $5,000. The trustee in his discretion  distributes $12,000 to A. Both A and the trust report on the calendar  year basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The trust qualifies for the separate share treatment under  section 663(c) and the distributable net income must be divided into  three parts for the purpose of determining the amount deductible by the  trust under section 661 and the amount includible in A's gross income  under section 662.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The distributable net income of each share of the trust is  $5,000 ($6,667 less $1,667). Since the amount ($12,000) distributed to A   during 1955 exceeds the distributable net income of $5,000 allocated to  his share, the trust is deemed to have distributed to him $5,000 of 1955  income and $7,000 of amounts other than 1955 income. Accordingly, the  trust is allowed a deduction of $5,000 under section 661. The taxable  income of the trust for 1955 is $9,900, computed as follows:  Royalties.........................................    $20,000 Deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Expenses........................................     $5,000</p><p class="depth0">Distribution to A...............................      5,000</p><p class="depth0">Personal exemption..............................        100</p><p class="depth0">.........     10,100</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income...........................................      9,900</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In accordance with section 662, A must include in his gross  income for 1955 an amount equal to the portion ($5,000) of the  distributable net income of the trust allocated to his share. Also, the  excess distribution of $7,000 made by the trust is subject to the  throwback provisions of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I,  subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Testator, who dies in 2000, is survived by a  spouse and two children. Testator's will contains a fractional formula  bequest dividing the residuary estate between the surviving spouse and a  trust for the benefit of the children. Under the fractional formula, the  marital bequest constitutes 60% of the estate and the children's trust  constitutes 40% of the estate. During the year, the executor makes a  partial proportionate distribution of $1,000,0000, ($600,000 to the  surviving spouse and $400,000 to the children's trust) and makes no  other distributions. The estate receives dividend income of $20,000, and  pays expenses of $8,000 that are deductible on the estate's federal  income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The fractional formula bequests to the surviving  spouse and to the children's trust are separate shares. Because  Testator's will provides for fractional formula residuary bequests, the  income and any appreciation in the value of the estate assets are  proportionately allocated between the marital share and the trust's  share. Therefore, in determining the distributable net income of each  share, the income and expenses must be allocated 60% to the marital  share and 40% to the trust's share. The distributable net income is  $7,200 (60% of income less 60% of expenses) for the marital share and  $4,800 (40% of income less 40% of expenses) for the trust's share.  Because the amount distributed in partial satisfaction of each bequest  exceeds the distributable net income of each share, the estate's  distribution deduction under section 661 is limited to the sum of the  distributable net income for both shares. The estate is allowed a  distribution deduction of $12,000 ($7,200 for the marital share and  $4,800 for the trust's share). As a result, the estate has zero taxable  income ($20,000 income less $8,000 expenses and $12,000 distribution  deduction). Under section 662, the surviving spouse and the trust must  include in gross income $7,200 and $4,800, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that in  2000 the executor makes the payment to partially fund the children's  trust but makes no payment to the surviving spouse. The fiduciary must  use a reasonable and equitable method to allocate income and expenses to  the trust's share. Therefore, depending on when the distribution is made  to the trust, it may no longer be reasonable or equitable to determine  the distributable net income for the trust's share by allocating to it  40% of the estate's income and expenses for the year. The computation of  the distributable net income for the trust's share should take into  consideration that after the partial distribution the relative size of  the trust's separate share is reduced and the relative size of the  spouse's separate share is increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Testator, who dies in 2000, is survived by a  spouse and one child. Testator's will provides for a pecuniary formula  bequest to be paid in not more than three installments to a trust for  the benefit of the child of the largest amount that can pass free of  Federal estate tax and a bequest of the residuary to the surviving  spouse. The will provides that the bequest to the child's trust is not  entitled to any of the estate's income and does not participate in  appreciation or depreciation in estate assets. During the 2000 taxable  year, the estate receives dividend income of $200,000 and pays expenses  of $15,000 that are deductible on the estate's federal income tax  return. The executor partially funds the child's trust by distributing  to it securities that have an adjusted basis to the estate of $350,000  and a fair market value of $380,000 on the date of distribution. As a  result of this distribution, the estate realizes long-term capital gain  of $30,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The estate has two separate shares consisting of a  formula pecuniary bequest to the child's trust and a residuary bequest  to the surviving spouse. Because, under the terms of the will, no estate  income is allocated to the bequest to the child's trust, the  distributable net income for that trust's share is zero. Therefore, with  respect to the $380,000 distribution to the child's trust, the estate is  allowed no deduction under section 661, and no amount is included in the  trust's gross income under section 662. Because no distributions were  made to the spouse, there is no need to compute the distributable net  income allocable to the marital share. The taxable income of the estate  for the 2000 taxable year is $214,400 ($200,000 (dividend income) plus  $30,000 (capital gain) minus $15,000 (expenses) and minus $600 (personal  exemption)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that  during 2000 the estate reports on its federal income tax return a pro  rata share of an S corporation's tax items and a distributive share of a  partnership's tax items allocated on Form K-1s to the estate by the S  corporation and by the partnership, respectively. Because, under the  terms of the will, no estate income from the S corporation or the  partnership would be allocated to the pecuniary bequest to child's  trust, none of the tax items attributable to the S corporation stock or  the partnership interest is allocated to the trust's separate share.  Therefore, with respect to the $380,000 distribution to the trust, the  estate is allowed no deduction under section 661, and no amount is  included in the trust's gross income under section 662.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that  during 2000 the estate receives a distribution of $900,000 from the  decedent's individual retirement account that is included in the  estate's gross income as income in respect of a decedent under section  691(a). The entire $900,000 is allocated to corpus under applicable  local law. Both the separate share for the child's trust and the  separate share for the surviving spouse may potentially be funded with  the proceeds from the individual retirement account. Therefore, a  portion of the $900,000 gross income must be allocated to the trust's  separate share. The amount allocated to the trust's share must be based  upon the relative values of the two separate shares using a reasonable  and equitable method. The estate is entitled to a deduction under  section 661 for the portion of the $900,000 properly allocated to the  trust's separate share, and the trust must include this amount in income  under section 662.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Testator, who dies in 2000, is survived by a  spouse and three adult children. Testator's will divides the residue of  the estate equally among the three children. The surviving spouse files  an election under the applicable state's elective share statute. Under  this statute, a surviving spouse is entitled to one-third of the  decedent's estate after the payment of debts and expenses. The statute  also provides that the surviving spouse is not entitled to any of the  estate's income and does not participate in appreciation or depreciation  of the estate's assets. However, under the statute, the surviving spouse  is entitled to interest on the elective share from the date of the court  order directing the payment until the executor actually makes payment.  During the estate's 2001 taxable year, the estate distributes to the  surviving spouse $5,000,000 in partial satisfaction of the elective  share and pays $200,000 of interest on the delayed payment of the  elective share. During that year, the estate receives dividend income of  $3,000,000 and pays expenses of $60,000 that are deductible on the  estate's federal income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The estate has four separate shares consisting of  the surviving spouse's elective share and each of the three children's  residuary bequests. Because the surviving spouse is not entitled to any  estate income under state law, none of the estate's gross income is  allocated to the spouse's separate share for purposes of determining  that share's distributable net income. Therefore, with respect to the  $5,000,000 distribution, the estate is allowed no deduction under  section 661, and no amount is included in the spouse's gross income  under section 662. The $200,000 of interest paid to the spouse must be  included in the spouse's gross income under section 61. Because no  distributions were made to any other beneficiaries during the year,  there is no need to compute the distributable net income of the other  three separate shares. Thus, the taxable income of the estate for the  2000 taxable year is $2,939,400 ($3,000,000 (dividend income) minus  $60,000 (expenses) and $600 (personal exemption)). The estate's $200,000  interest payment is a nondeductible personal interest expense described  in section 163(h).</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The will of Testator, who dies in 2000, directs the  executor to distribute the X stock and all dividends therefrom to child  A and the residue of the estate to child B. The estate has two separate  shares consisting of the income on the X stock bequeathed to A and the  residue of the estate bequeathed to B. The bequest of the X stock meets  the definition of section 663(a)(1) and therefore is not a separate  share. If any distributions, other than shares of the X stock, are made  during the year to either A or B, then for purposes of determining the  distributable net income for the separate shares, gross income  attributable to dividends on the X stock must be allocated to A's  separate share and any other income must be allocated to B's separate  share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The will of Testator, who dies in 2000, directs the  executor to divide the residue of the estate equally between Testator's  two children, A and B. The will directs the executor to fund A's share  first with the proceeds of Testator's individual retirement account. The  date of death value of the estate after the payment of debts, expenses,  and estate taxes is $9,000,000. During 2000, the $900,000 balance in  Testator's individual retirement account is distributed to the estate.  The entire $900,000 is allocated to corpus under applicable local law.  This amount is income in respect of a decedent within the meaning of  section 691(a). The estate has two separate shares, one for the benefit  of A and one for the benefit of B. If any distributions are made to  either A or B during the year, then, for purposes of determining the  distributable net income for each separate share,   the $900,000 of income in respect of a decedent must be allocated to A's  share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that the  will directs the executor to fund A's share first with X stock valued at  $3,000,000, rather than with the proceeds of the individual retirement  account. The estate has two separate shares, one for the benefit of A  and one for the benefit of B. If any distributions are made to either A  or B during the year, then, for purposes of determining the  distributable net income for each separate share, the $900,000 of gross  income attributable to the proceeds from the individual retirement  account must be allocated between the two shares to the extent that they  could potentially be funded with those proceeds. The maximum amount of  A's share that could potentially be funded with the income in respect of  decedent is $1,500,000 ($4,500,000 value of share less $3,000,000 to be  funded with stock) and the maximum amount of B's share that could  potentially be funded with income in respect of decedent is $4,500,000.  Based upon the relative values of these amounts, the gross income  attributable to the proceeds of the individual retirement account is  allocated $225,000 (or one-fourth) to A's share and $675,000 (or three- fourths) to B's share.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. The will of Testator, who dies in 2000, provides that  after the payment of specific bequests of money, the residue of the  estate is to be divided equally among the Testator's three children, A,  B, and C. The will also provides that during the period of  administration one-half of the income from the residue is to be paid to  a designated charitable organization. After the specific bequests of  money are paid, the estate initially has three equal separate shares.  One share is for the benefit of the charitable organization and A,  another share is for the benefit of the charitable organization and B,  and the last share is for the benefit of the charitable organization and  C. During the period of administration, payments of income to the  charitable organization are deductible by the estate to the extent  provided in section 642(c) and are not subject to the distribution  provisions of sections 661 and 662.
