                                Sec. 256.1  What is Treasury's role in paying awards and settlements
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Judgment Fund is a permanent, indefinite appropriation which is available to pay many judicially and administratively ordered monetary awards against the United States. In addition, amounts owed under compromise agreements negotiated by the U.S. Department of Justice in settlement of claims arising under actual or imminent litigation are normally paid from the Judgment Fund, if a judgment on the merits would be payable from the Judgment Fund. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) certifies payments from the Judgment Fund when the following four tests have been met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Awards or settlements are final;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Awards or settlements are monetary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One of the authorities specified in 31 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3) provides for payment of the award or settlement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment may not legally be made from any other source of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additionally, Fiscal Service requires that requests for payment identify the statute that forms the basis of the underlying claim. The award or settlement must comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements that authorize the award or settlement. For example, interest is payable on Judgment Fund awards only if there is an express statutory provision, contractual agreement or constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity authorizing the assessment of interest against the United States. Also, a tort under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is payable from the Judgment Fund only when the award amount exceeds $2,500 (for administrative awards) and is in compliance with the regulatory requirements at 28 CFR part 14.</p>
