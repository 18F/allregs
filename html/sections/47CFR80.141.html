All such radio messages must be preceded by the safety signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A ship station may accept communications for retransmission to any other station in the maritime mobile service. Whenever such messages or communications have been received and acknowledged by a ship station for this purpose, that station must retransmit the message as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service requirements for vessels. Each ship station provided for compliance with Part II of Title III of the Communications Act must provide a public correspondence service on voyages of more than 24 hours for any person who requests the service.
