                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (1) and (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total of all outstanding obligations for qualified campaign  expenses as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as determined under  11 CFR 9033.5, plus estimated necessary winding down costs as defined  under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3), less</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of  eligibility (including all contributions dated on or before that date  whether or not submitted for matching; currency; balances on deposit in  banks; savings and loan institutions; and other depository institutions;  traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any  other committee investments valued at fair market value);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on  hand; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds  of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of qualified campaign  expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount based on the  collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or rebates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liabilities. (1) The amount submitted as the total of  outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section  shall not include any accounts payable for non-qualified campaign  expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as  repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety  bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be broken down by expense  category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall  include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal  expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental,  telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and  storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in  each category from the time the statement is submitted until the  expected termination of the committee's political activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Capital assets. For purposes of this section, the term  capital assets means any property used in the operation of the campaign  whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when received by the committee.  Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section  includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles  and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's  campaign, but does not include property defined as ``other assets''  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Capital assets include items  such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the  equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that  are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be  maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The  fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the  total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items  received after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair  market value on the date received. A candidate may claim a lower fair  market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the  statement separately and demonstrating, through documentation, the lower  fair market value. If the candidate receives public funding for the  general election, a lower fair market value shall not be claimed under  this section for any capital assets transferred or sold to the  candidate's general election committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee  determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any  credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in  part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the  determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall  include records showing the original amount of the account receivable,  copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor  showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how  the lesser amount or full writeoff was determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contributions received from joint fundraising activities  conducted under 11 CFR 9034.8 may be used to pay a candidate's  outstanding campaign obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such contributions shall be deemed monies available to pay  outstanding campaign obligations as of the date these funds are received  by the fundraising representative committee and shall be included in the  candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of money deemed available to pay a candidate's net  outstanding campaign obligations will equal either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An amount calculated on the basis of the predetermined  allocation formula, as adjusted for 52 U.S.C. 30116 limitations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a candidate receives an amount greater than that calculated  under 11 CFR 9034.5(e)(2)(i), the amount actually received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With each submission for matching fund payments filed after  the candidate's date of ineligibility, the candidate shall certify that,  as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date  of submission for matching funds, his or her remaining net outstanding  campaign obligations equal or exceed the amount submitted for matching.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A candidate who makes a submission for matching fund payments  after his or her date of ineligibility shall also submit a revised  statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. This revised  statement shall be due before the next regularly scheduled payment date,  on a date to be determined and published by the Commission. This  statement shall reflect the financial   status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days  before the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also  contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's assets and  obligations from the previous statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does  not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled  payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the  candidate shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding  campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date to  be determined and published by the commission, which will be before the  next regularly scheduled payment date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Commission receives information indicating that  substantial assets of the candidate's authorized committee(s) have been  undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of  outstanding campaign obligations has been otherwise overstated in  relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily  suspend further matching payments pending a final determination whether  the candidate is entitled to receive all or a portion of the matching  funds requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In making a determination under 11 CFR 9034.5(g)(1), the  Commission will follow the procedures for initial and final  determinations under 11 CFR 9033.10 (b) and (c). The Commission will  notify the candidate of its initial determination within 15 business  days after receipt of the candidate's statement of net outstanding  campaign obligations. Within 15 business days after service of the  Commission's notice, the candidate may submit written legal or factual  materials to demonstrate that he or she has net outstanding campaign  obligations that entitle the campaign to further matching payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding  campaign obligations still exceeds committee assets, he or she may  continue to receive matching payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Following a final determination under this section, the  candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR  9038.5(a).
