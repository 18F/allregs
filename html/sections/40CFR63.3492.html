                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant  material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you  are not required to meet any operating limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For any controlled coating operation(s) on which you use the  emission rate with add-on controls option or the control efficiency/ outlet concentration option, except those for which you use a solvent  recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according  to Sec. 63.3541(i), you must meet the operating limits specified in  Table 4 to this subpart. Those operating limits apply to the emission  capture and control systems for the coating operation(s) used for  purposes of complying with this subpart. You must establish the  operating limits during the initial performance test according to the  requirements in Sec. 63.3546 or Sec. 63.3556. New   and reconstructed sources must meet the operating limits at all times  after they have been established during the performance test, and  existing sources must meet the operating limits at all times after the  compliance date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in  Table 4 to this subpart or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and  comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the  Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under Sec.  63.8(f).
