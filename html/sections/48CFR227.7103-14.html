                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to  technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the  requirements of the contract concerning such data; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such  other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period  if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract  pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conformity and acceptance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Solicitations and contracts  requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements  the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their  authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether  technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of  Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price  pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or  negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount  subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a  percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be  determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of  the data. For example--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the  relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of  data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a  secondary objective; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and  maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data  that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the  contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming  restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection),  correction or replacement of nonconforming data or an equitable  reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the  nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's  interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and  acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract  does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for  nonconforming deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming  markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to  contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to  withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause,  pending correction of the nonconforming markings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Warranty. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The intended use of the technical data and the  cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before  deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a  particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a  consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the  technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process. For  example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends  to repair or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data  would impair the Government's effective use of the item or result in  increased costs to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001,  Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause  when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.  [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 31912, June 8, 2004]</p>
