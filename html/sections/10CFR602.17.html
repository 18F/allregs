                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A recipient shall periodically report to DOE on the project's progress in meeting the project objectives of the award. The following types of reports shall be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Progress Reports. After issuance of an initial award, recipients must submit a satisfactory progress report to receive a continuation award for the remainder of the project period. The original and two copies of the required report must be submitted to the Office of Health, Safety and Security program manager 90 days prior to the anticipated continuation funding date. The report should include results of work to date and emphasize findings and their significance to the field, and any real or anticipated problems. The report also should contain the following information: On the first page, provide the project title, principal investigator/project director name, period of time the report covers, name and address of recipient organization, DOE award number, the amount of unexpended funds, if any, that are anticipated to be left at the end of the current budget period. If the amount exceeds 10 percent of the funds available for the budget period, provide information as to why the excess funds are anticipated to be available and how they will be used in the next budget period. The report should state whether the aims have changed from the original application, and if they have, provide revised aims. A completed budget page must be submitted with the continuation progress report when a change to anticipated future costs will exceed 25 percent of the original recommended future budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of Energy Research and Development (R&D;) Project. A Notice of Energy R&D; Project, DOE Form 1430.22, which summarizes the purpose and scope of the project, must be submitted in accordance with the Distribution and Schedule of Documents set forth in appendix A to this part, Schedule of Renewal Applications and Reports. Copies of the form may be obtained from a DOE contracting office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special Reports. The recipient shall report the following events to DOE as soon after they occur as possible:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially affect the ability to attain project objectives or prevent the meeting of time schedules and goals. The report must describe remedial action that the recipient has taken, or plans to take, and any action DOE should take to alleviate the problems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Favorable developments or events that enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner, or a lower cost than anticipated, or producing more beneficial results than originally projected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final Report. A final report covering the entire project must be submitted by the recipient within 90 days after the project period ends or the award is terminated. Satisfactory completion of an award will be contingent upon the receipt of this report. The final report shall follow the same outline as progress reports. Recipients will provide, as part of the final report, a description of records and data compiled during the project, along with a plan for its preservation or disposition (see Sec. 602.19 of this part). All manuscripts prepared for publication should be appended to the final report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Financial Status Report (FSR) (OMB No. 0348-0039). The FSR is required within 90 days after completion of each budget period. For budget periods exceeding 12 months, an FSR is also required within 90 days after this first 12 months unless waived by the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DOE may extend the deadline date for any report if the recipient submits a written request before the deadline, that adequately justifies an extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A table summarizing the various types of reports, time for submission, and number of copies is set forth in appendix A to this part. The schedule of reports shall be as prescribed in this table, unless the award document specifies otherwise. These reports shall be submitted by the recipient to the awarding office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DOE, or its authorized representatives, may make site visits, at any reasonable time, to review the project. DOE may provide such technical assistance as may be requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on a subrecipient consistent with the provisions of this section.
