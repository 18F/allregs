How the Model Privacy Form Is Used</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The model form may be used, at the option of a financial institution, including a group of financial institutions that use a common privacy notice, to meet the content requirements of the privacy notice and opt-out notice set forth in Sec. Sec.  160.6 and 160.7 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The model form is a standardized form, including page layout, content, format, style, pagination, and shading. Institutions seeking to obtain the safe harbor through use of the model form may modify it only as described in these Instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Note that disclosure of certain information, such as assets, income, and information from a consumer reporting agency, may give rise to obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x] (FCRA), such as a requirement to permit a consumer to opt out of disclosures to affiliates or designation as a consumer reporting agency if disclosures are made to nonaffiliated third parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The word ``customer'' may be replaced by the word ``member'' whenever it appears in the model form, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Contents of the Model Privacy Form</p><p class="depth0">The model form consists of two pages, which may be printed on both sides of a single sheet of paper, or may appear on two separate pages.

Financial institutions that use the model form must use an easily readable type font. While a number of factors together produce easily readable type font, institutions are required to use a minimum of 10-point font (unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Instructions) and sufficient spacing between the lines of type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Logo. A financial institution may include a corporate logo on any page of the notice, so long as it does not interfere with the

readability of the model form or the space constraints of each page.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Page size and orientation. Each page of the model form must be printed on paper in portrait orientation, the size of which must be sufficient to meet the layout and minimum font size requirements, with sufficient white space on the top, bottom, and sides of the content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Color. The model form must be printed on white or light color paper (such as cream) with black or other contrasting ink color. Spot color may be used to achieve visual interest, so long as the color contrast is distinctive and the color does not detract from the readability of the model form. Logos may also be printed in color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Languages. The model form may be translated into languages other than English.</p><p class="depth0">C.

(1) The bulleted list identifies the types of personal information that the institution collects and shares.

In the middle column, each institution must provide a ``Yes'' or ``No'' response that accurately reflects its information sharing policies and practices with respect to the reason listed on the left. In the right column, each institution must provide in each box one of the following three (3) responses, as applicable, that reflects whether a consumer can limit such sharing: ``Yes'' if it is required to or voluntarily provides an opt-out; ``No'' if it does not provide an opt-out; or ``We don't share'' if it answers ``No'' in the middle column. Only the sixth row (``For our affiliates to market to you'') may be omitted at the option of the institution. See paragraph C.2(d)(6) of this Instruction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Specific disclosures and corresponding legal provisions. (1) For our everyday business purposes. This reason incorporates sharing information under Sec. Sec.  160.14 and 160.15 and with service providers pursuant to Sec.  160.13 of this part other than the purposes specified in paragraphs C.2(d)(2) or C.2(d)(3) of these Instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For our marketing purposes. This reason incorporates sharing information with service providers by an institution for its own marketing pursuant to Sec.  160.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For joint marketing with other financial companies. This reason incorporates sharing information under joint marketing agreements between two or more financial institutions and with any service provider used in connection with such agreements pursuant to Sec.  160.13 of this part.

This reason incorporates sharing information specified in sections 603(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For our affiliates' everyday business purposes--information about creditworthiness. This reason incorporates sharing information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason must provide an opt-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For our affiliates to market to you. This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include

this reason must provide an opt-out of indefinite duration. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form. Note: The CFTC's Regulations do not address the affiliate marketing rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For nonaffiliates to market to you. This reason incorporates sharing described in Sec. Sec.  160.7 and 160.10(a) of this part. An institution that shares personal information for this reason must provide an opt-out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> To limit our sharing: A financial institution must include this section of the model form only if it provides an opt-out. The word ``choice'' may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words ``toll-free'' before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the ``Yes'' responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled ``Please note'' institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked ``[30].'' Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Questions box. Customer service contact information must be inserted as appropriate, where [phone number] or [Web site] appear.

Financial institutions must include this mail-in form only if they state in the ``To limit our sharing'' box that consumers can opt out by mail. The mail-in form must provide opt-out options that correspond accurately to the ``Yes'' responses in the third column in the disclosure table. Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as ``[account ].'' Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the ``[account ]'' reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (see version 3); or below the form (see version 4). The reverse side of the mail-in opt-out form must not include any content of the model form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Joint accountholder. Only institutions that provide their joint accountholders the choice to opt out for only one accountholder, in accordance with paragraph C.3(a)(5) of these Instructions, must include in the far left column of the mail-in form the following statement: ``If you have a joint account, your choice(s) will apply to everyone on your account unless you mark below. Apply my choice(s) only to me.'' The word ``choice'' may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word ``policy'' for ``account'' in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FCRA Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out. If the institution shares personal information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: ``Do not share information about my creditworthiness with your affiliates for their everyday business purposes.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FCRA Section 624 opt-out. If the institution incorporates section 624 of the FCRA in accord with paragraph C.2(d)(6) of these Instructions, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: ``Do not allow your affiliates to use my personal information to market to me.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nonaffiliate opt-out. If the financial institution shares personal information pursuant to Sec.  160.10(a) of this part, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: ``Do not share my personal information with nonaffiliates to market their products and services to me.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional opt-outs. Financial institutions that use the disclosure table to provide opt-out options beyond those required by Federal law must provide those opt-outs in this section of the model form. A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for its own marketing in the mail-in opt-out form must include one of the two following statements: ``Do not share my personal information to market to me.'' or ``Do not use my personal information to market to me.'' A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for joint marketing must include the following statement: ``Do not share my personal information with other financial institutions to jointly market to me.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Barcodes. A financial institution may elect to include a barcode and/or ``tagline'' (an internal identifier) in 6-point font at the bottom of page one, as needed for information internal to the institution, so long as these do not interfere with the clarity or text of the form.</p><p class="depth0">3. Page Two</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Instructions for the Questions. Certain of the Questions may be customized as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Who is providing this notice?'' This question may be omitted where only one financial institution provides the model form and that institution is clearly identified in the title on page one. Two or more financial institutions that jointly provide the model form must use this question to identify themselves as required by Sec.  160.9(f) of this part. Where the list of institutions exceeds four (4) lines, the institution must describe in the response to this question the general types of institutions jointly providing the notice and must separately identify those institutions, in minimum 8-point font, directly following the ``Other important information'' box, or, if that box is not included in the institution's form, directly following the ``Definitions.''
