                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Some projects are directed by either authorizing  legislation and/or appropriations to specifically support a designated  institution or set of institutions for particular research, education,  or extension topics of importance to the nation, a State, or a region.  Although these projects may be awarded noncompetitively, these projects  or activities are subject to the same application process, award terms  and conditions, Federal assistance laws and regulations, reporting and  monitoring requirements, and post-award administration and closeout  policies and procedures as competitive Federal assistance programs. The  only difference is these applications are not subject to a competitive  peer or merit review process at the Agency level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. All noncompetitive applications recommended for  funding are required to be reviewed by the program officer and, as  required, other Departmental and NIFA officials; and the review  documented by the NIFA program officer. For awards recommended for  funding at or greater than $10,000, an independent review and a unit  review by program officials are required.</p>
