There are no  professional requirements for renewal of an endorsement as marine  physician assistant or hospital corpsman.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An applicant for renewal of an endorsement as master or mate  (pilot) of towing vessels, in addition to the other requirements in this  paragraph, must also submit satisfactory evidence of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Having completed a practical demonstration of maneuvering and  handling a towing vessel to the satisfaction of a designated examiner;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ongoing participation in training and drills during the  validity of the license or MMC being renewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An applicant seeking to renew a tankerman endorsement must meet  the additional requirements listed in Sec. 13.120 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> There are no professional requirements for renewal for the  following endorsements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Staff officers (all types).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ordinary seaman.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Wiper.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Steward's department.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Steward's department (F.H.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Cadet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Student observer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Apprentice engineer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Apprentice mate (issued under part 12 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Person in charge of medical care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Medical first-aid provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> GMDSS at-sea maintainer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> GMDSS operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as otherwise provided, each candidate for a renewal of an  STCW endorsement must meet the applicable requirements of part 11,  subpart C, and/or part 12, subpart F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Document of Continuity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants for renewal of national  endorsements, who are unwilling or otherwise unable to meet the  requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, including but not limited  to the medical and physical standards of subpart C of this part,  suitability standards of Sec. 10.211 of this part, drug tests,  professional requirements, and TWIC, may apply for a Document of  Continuity issued by the Coast Guard. Documents of Continuity do not  expire and are issued solely to maintain an individual's eligibility for  renewal. A Document of Continuity does not entitle an individual to  serve as a merchant mariner. A holder of a Document of Continuity may  obtain a properly endorsed, valid MMC at any time by satisfying the  requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of  this section as applicable. When a valid MMC is issued to replace a  previously held Document of Continuity, the previously issued Document  of Continuity becomes void.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications for a Document of Continuity must include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The endorsements to be placed into continuity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An application including a signed statement from the applicant  attesting to an awareness of the limited purpose of the Document of  Continuity, his or her inability to serve, and the requirements to  obtain an MMC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If not all MMC endorsements are to be converted into a Document  of Continuity, a new MMC will be issued with the active endorsements.  Once the new MMC and/or Document of Continuity is issued the previous  MMC is no longer valid and must be returned to the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> STCW endorsements may not be placed in continuity. If an  individual continues to maintain a valid MMC while placing specific  national endorsements into continuity, those STCW endorsements  associated with the national endorsements that were placed in continuity  are no longer valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No credential expired beyond the 12-month administrative grace  period in paragraph (h) of this section can be converted into a Document  of Continuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A holder of a Document of Continuity may obtain a properly  endorsed, valid MMC, including STCW endorsements, at any time by  satisfying the requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d)  and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Administrative grace period. A credential may be renewed up to  12 months after expiration. For a credential to be re-issued by the  Coast Guard more than 12 months after its expiration, an applicant must  comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. When an  applicant's credential expires during a time of service   with the Armed Forces and there is no reasonable opportunity for  renewal, including by mail, this period may be extended. The period of  military service following the date of expiration which precluded  renewal may be added to the 12-month grace period. The 12-month grace  period and any extensions do not affect the expiration date of the  credential. A license, MMD, COR, STCW endorsement, MMC, and any  endorsements thereon, are not valid for use after the expiration date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Re-issuance of expired credentials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an applicant applies  for re-issuance of an endorsement as deck officer, engineer officer, or  qualified rating more than 12 months after its expiration, instead of  the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the applicant must  demonstrate continued professional knowledge by completing a course  approved for this purpose, or by passing the complete examination for  original issue of the endorsement. The examination may be oral-assisted  if the expired credential was awarded based on the results of an oral  exam. The fees set forth in Sec. 10.219 of this part apply to these  examinations. In the case of an expired radio officer's endorsement, the  endorsement may be issued upon presentation of a valid first- or second- class radiotelegraph operator license issued by the Federal  Communications Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An endorsement for chief purser, purser, senior assistant  purser, junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician  assistant, medical doctor, or professional nurse that has been expired  for more than 12 months must be renewed in the same way as a current  endorsement of that type. There are no additional requirements for re- issuing endorsements for chief purser, purser, senior assistant purser,  junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician assistant,  medical doctor, or professional nurse that have been expired for more  than 12 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as master  or mate (pilot) of towing vessels more than 12 months after expiration  of the previous endorsement must complete the practical demonstration of  maneuvering and handling a towing vessel required under (e)(6)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as any  tankerman rating more than 12 months after expiration of the previous  endorsement must meet the requirements in Sec. 13.117 of this  subchapter.
