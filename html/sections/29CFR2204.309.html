The applicant, the Secretary, or both may seek review of the  judge's decision on the fee application, and the Commission may grant  such petitions for review or direct review of the decision on the  Commission's own initiative. The Commission delegates to each of its  members the authority to order review of a judge's decision concerning a  fee application. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the  discretion of each member of the Commission. If the Commission does not  direct review, the judge's decision on the application shall become a  final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is received and  docketed by the Executive Secretary of the Commission. If review is  directed, the Commission shall issue a final decision on the application  or remand the application to the judge for further proceedings.</p>
