                                Sec. 2580.412-12  Relationship of determining the amount of the

                            <p class="depth0">A determination of whether persons falling within the definition of administrator, officer or employee are required to be bonded depends on whether they ``handle'' funds or other property. Determining the amount of the bond is an aspect of the same process in that it requires a determination of what funds or other property are being handled or what amounts of funds or other property are subject to risk of loss with respect to the duties or powers of an administrator, officer or employee of a covered plan. Once this calculation is made, the required amount for which that person must be covered by a bond, either by himself or as a part of a group or class being bonded under a blanket or schedule bond, is not less than 10 percent of the amount ``handled'' or $1,000, whichever is the greater amount, except that no such

bond shall be required in an amount greater than $500,000 by virtue of these regulations. (See Sec. 2580.412-17.)</p>
