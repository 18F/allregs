This relief may be in addition to the enforcement actions described in Sec. Sec. 3809.601 and 3809.602 and the penalties described in Sec. 3809.700.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you fail to timely comply with a noncompliance order issued under Sec. 3809.601(a), and remain in noncompliance, BLM may order you to submit plans of operations under Sec. 3809.401 for current and future notice-level operations.
