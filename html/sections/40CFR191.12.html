                            <p class="depth0">Unless otherwise indicated in this subpart, all terms shall have the  same meaning as in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible environment means: (1) The atmosphere; (2) land surfaces;  (3) surface waters; (4) oceans; and (5) all of the lithosphere that is  beyond the controlled area.</p><p class="depth0">Active institutional control means: (1) Controlling access to a  disposal site by any means other than passive institutional controls;  (2) performing maintenance operations or remedial actions at a site, (3)  controlling or cleaning up releases from a site, or (4) monitoring  parameters related to disposal system performance.</p><p class="depth0">Annual committed effective dose means the committed effective dose  resulting from one-year intake of radionuclides released plus the annual  effective dose caused by direct radiation from facilities or activities  subject to subparts B and C of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Aquifer means an underground geological formation, group of  formations, or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a  significant amount of water to a well or spring.</p><p class="depth0">Barrier means any material or structure that prevents or  substantially delays movement of water or radionuclides toward the  accessible environment. For example, a barrier may be a geologic  structure, a canister, a waste form with physical and chemical  characteristics that significantly decrease the mobility of  radionuclides, or a material placed over and around waste, provided that  the material or structure substantially delays movement of water or  radionuclides.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled area means: (1) A surface location, to be identified by  passive institutional controls, that encompasses no more than 100 square  kilometers and extends horizontally no more than five kilometers in any  direction from the outer boundary of the original location of the  radioactive wastes in a disposal system; and (2) the subsurface  underlying such a surface location.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal system means any combination of engineered and natural  barriers that isolate spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste after  disposal.</p><p class="depth0">Dose equivalent means the product of absorbed dose and appropriate  factors to account for differences in biological effectiveness due to  the quality of radiation and its spatial distribution in the body; the  unit of dose equivalent is the ``rem'' (``sievert'' in SI units).</p><p class="depth0">Effective dose means the sum over specified tissues of the products  of the dose equivalent received following an exposure of, or an intake  of radionuclides into, specified tissues of the body, multiplied by  appropriate weighting factors. This allows the various tissue-specific  health risks to be summed into an overall health risk. The method used  to calculate effective dose is described in appendix B of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Ground water means water below the land surface in a zone of  saturation.</p><p class="depth0">Heavy metal means all uranium, plutonium, or thorium placed into a  nuclear reactor.</p><p class="depth0">Implementing agency means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The Commission for facilities licensed by the Commission;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The Agency for those implementation responsibilities for the  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, under this part, given to the Agency by the  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act (Pub. L. 102-579, 106  Stat. 4777) which, for the purposes of this part, are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Determinations by the Agency that the Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant is in compliance with subpart A of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Issuance of criteria for the certifications of compliance with  subparts B and C of this part of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's  compliance with subparts B and C of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Certifications of compliance with subparts B and C of this  part of   the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's compliance with subparts B and C of  this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> If the initial certification is made, periodic recertification  of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's continued compliance with subparts  B and C of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Review and comment on performance assessment reports of the  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vi)</em> Concurrence by the Agency with the Department's determination  under Sec. 191.02(i) that certain wastes do not need the degree of  isolation required by subparts B and C of this part; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The Department of Energy for any other disposal facility and all  other implementation responsibilities for the Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant, under this part, not given to the Agency.</p><p class="depth2">International System of Units is the version of the metric system  which has been established by the International Bureau of Weights and  Measures and is administered in the United States by the National  Institute of Standards and Technology. The abbreviation for this system  is ``SI.''</p><p class="depth2">Lithosphere means the solid part of the Earth below the surface,  including any ground water contained within it.</p><p class="depth2">Passive institutional control means: (1) Permanent markers placed at  a disposal site, (2) public records and archives, (3) government  ownership and regulations regarding land or resource use, and (4) other  methods of preserving knowledge about the location, design, and contents  of a disposal system.</p><p class="depth2">Performance assessment means an analysis that: (1) Identifies the  processes and events that might affect the disposal system; (2) examines  the effects of these processes and events on the performance of the  disposal system; and (3) estimates the cumulative releases of  radionuclides, considering the associated uncertainties, caused by all  significant processes and events. These estimates shall be incorporated  into an overall probability distribution of cumulative release to the  extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2">Radioactive material means matter composed of or containing  radionuclides, with radiological half-lives greater than 20 years,  subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.</p><p class="depth2">SI unit means a unit of measure in the International System of  Units.</p><p class="depth2">Sievert is the SI unit of effective dose and is equal to 100 rem or  one joule per kilogram. The abbreviation is ``Sv.''</p><p class="depth2">Undisturbed performance means the predicted behavior of a disposal  system, including consideration of the uncertainties in predicted  behavior, if the disposal system is not disrupted by human intrusion or  the occurrence of unlikely natural events.</p><p class="depth2">Waste, as used in this subpart, means any spent nuclear fuel or  radioactive waste isolated in a disposal system.</p><p class="depth2">Waste form means the materials comprising the radioactive components  of waste and any encapsulating or stabilizing matrix.
