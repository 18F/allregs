                                Sec.  803.3  How does FDA define the terms used in this part?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Some of the terms we use in this part are specific to medical device reporting and reflect the language used in the statute (law). Other terms are more general and reflect our interpretation of the law. This section defines the following terms as used in this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ambulatory surgical facility (ASF) means a distinct entity that operates for the primary purpose of furnishing same day outpatient surgical services to patients. An ASF may be either an independent entity (i.e., not a part of a provider of services or any other facility) or operated by another medical entity (e.g., under the common ownership, licensure, or control of an entity). An ASF is subject to this regulation regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, State, municipal, or local government or regardless of whether it is accredited by a recognized accreditation organization. If an adverse event meets the criteria for reporting, the ASF must report that event regardless of the nature or location of the medical service provided by the ASF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Become aware means that an employee of the entity required to report has acquired information that reasonably suggests a reportable adverse event has occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are a device user facility, you are considered to have ``become aware'' when medical personnel, as defined in this section, who are employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with your facility, obtain information about a reportable event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a manufacturer, you are considered to have become aware of an event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable event that is required to be reported within 30 calendar days or that is required to be reported within 5 work days because we had requested reports in accordance with Sec.  803.53(b). You are also considered to have become aware of an event when

any of your employees with management or supervisory responsibilities over persons with regulatory, scientific, or technical responsibilities, or whose duties relate to the collection and reporting of adverse events, becomes aware, from any information, including any trend analysis, that a reportable MDR event or events necessitates remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are an importer, you are considered to have become aware of an event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable event that is required to be reported by you within 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Caused or contributed means that a death or serious injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device, or that a medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including events occurring as a result of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Malfunction,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Improper or inadequate design,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manufacture,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Labeling, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> User error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Device user facility means a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, or outpatient treatment facility as defined in this section, which is not a physician's office, as defined in this section. School nurse offices and employee health units are not device user facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distributor means any person (other than the manufacturer or importer) who furthers the marketing of a device from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate user, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling of the device or device package. If you repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling, you are considered a manufacturer as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Expected life of a device means the time that a device is expected to remain functional after it is placed into use. Certain implanted devices have specified ``end of life'' (EOL) dates. Other devices are not labeled as to their respective EOL, but are expected to remain operational through activities such as maintenance, repairs, or upgrades, for an estimated period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> FDA, we, us, or Agency means the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Five-day report means a medical device report that must be submitted by a manufacturer to us under Sec.  803.53 within 5 work days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hospital means a distinct entity that operates for the primary purpose of providing diagnostic, therapeutic (such as medical, occupational, speech, physical), surgical, and other patient services for specific and general medical conditions. Hospitals include general, chronic disease, rehabilitative, psychiatric, and other special-purpose facilities. A hospital may be either independent (e.g., not a part of a provider of services or any other facility) or may be operated by another medical entity (e.g., under the common ownership, licensure, or control of another entity). A hospital is covered by this regulation regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, State, municipal or local government or whether it is accredited by a recognized accreditation organization. If an adverse event meets the criteria for reporting, the hospital must report that event regardless of the nature or location of the medical service provided by the hospital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Importer means any person who imports a device into the United States and who furthers the marketing of a device from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate user, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling of the device or device package. If you repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling, you are considered a manufacturer as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Malfunction means the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device. The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is labeled or

This number uniquely identifies each individual adverse event report submitted by a manufacturer or importer. This number consists of the following three parts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDA registration number for the manufacturing site of the reported device, or the registration number for the importer. If the manufacturing site or the importer does not have an establishment registration number, we will assign a temporary MDR reporting number until the site is registered in accordance with part 807 of this chapter. We will inform the manufacturer or importer of the temporary MDR reporting number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The four-digit calendar year in which the report is submitted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The five-digit sequence number of the reports submitted during the year, starting with 00001.

(For example, a complete user facility report number will appear as follows: 1234560000-2011-0001. If a user facility has more than one CMS number, it must select one that will be used for all of its MDR reports. If a user facility has no CMS number, it should use all zeros in the appropriate space in its initial report (e.g., 0000000000-2011-0001). We will assign a number for future use and send that number to the user facility. This number is used in our record of the initial report, in subsequent reports, and in any correspondence with the user facility. If a facility has multiple sites, the primary site may submit reports for all sites and use one reporting number for all sites if the primary site provides the name, address, and CMS number for each respective site.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Work day means Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P) regulated as a device means an HCT/P as defined in Sec.  1271.3(d) of this chapter that does not meet the criteria in Sec.  1271.10(a) and that is also regulated as a device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(bb)</em> Unique device identifier (UDI) means an identifier that adequately identifies a device through its distribution and use by meeting the requirements of Sec.  830.20 of this chapter.
