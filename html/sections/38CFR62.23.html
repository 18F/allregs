However, VA will also use the following considerations to select applicants for funding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA will give preference to applicants that provide, or coordinate the provision of, supportive services for very low-income veteran families transitioning from homelessness to permanent housing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent practicable, VA will ensure that supportive services grants are equitably distributed across geographic regions, including rural communities and tribal lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, VA will fund the highest-ranked applicants for which funding is available, within the highest funding priority group, if any. If funding priorities have been established, to the extent funding is available and subject to paragraph (d) of this section, VA will select applicants in the next highest

funding priority group based on their rank within that group.
