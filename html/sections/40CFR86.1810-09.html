Sec. 86.1810-01 is identical and applicable to Sec. 86.1810-09, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.1810-01.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of Sec. 86.1810-01 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ``[Reserved]'' This section applies to model year 2009 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels. This section also applies to MDPVs and complete heavy-duty vehicles certified according to the provisions of this subpart. Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated. This section also applies to hybrid electric vehicles and zero emission vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, requirements and provisions of this subpart applicable to methanol fueled vehicles are also applicable to Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 ethanol fueled vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> through (e) [Reserved] For guidance see Sec. 86.1810-01.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Altitude requirements.

Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude must require engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and validity of the AECD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> through (p) [Reserved] For guidance see Sec. 86.1810-01.
