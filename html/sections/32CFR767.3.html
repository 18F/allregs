                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Naval Historical Center's policy has been to evaluate each DON ship and aircraft wreck on an individual basis. In some cases, the removal of DON ship and aircraft wrecks may be necessary or appropriate to protect the cultural resource and/or to fulfill other NHC goals, such as those encompassing research, education, public access, and appreciation. Recovery of DON ship and aircraft wrecks may be justified in specific cases where the existence of a cultural resource may be threatened. Therefore, recovery of some or all of a cultural resource may be permitted for identification and/or investigation to answer specific questions; or the recovery presents an opportunity for public research or education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, DON ship and aircraft wrecks will be left in place unless artifact removal or site disturbance is justified and necessary to protect DON ship and aircraft wrecks, to conduct research, or provide public education and information that is otherwise inaccessible. While NHC prefers non-destructive, in situ research on DON ship and aircraft wrecks, it recognizes that site disturbance and/or artifact recovery is sometimes necessary. At such times, site disturbance and/or archeological recovery may be permitted, subject to conditions specified by NHC.</p>
