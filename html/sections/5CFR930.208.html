An agency may request from OPM the services of an administrative law judge if the agency is occasionally or temporarily insufficiently staffed with administrative law judges, or an agency may loan the services of its administrative law judges to other agencies if there is insufficient work to fully occupy the administrative law judges' work schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency's request to OPM for the services of an administrative law judge must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify and briefly describe the nature of the cases(s) to be heard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify the legal authority for which the use of an administrative law judge is required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrate, as appropriate, that the agency has no administrative law judge available to hear the case(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The services of an administrative law judge under this program are made from the starting date of the detail until the end of the current fiscal year, but may be extended into the next fiscal year with OPM's approval. Decisions for an extension are made by OPM on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency requesting the services of an administrative law judge under this program is responsible for reimbursing the agency that employs the administrative law judge for the cost of the service.</p>
