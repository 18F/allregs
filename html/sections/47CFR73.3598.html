                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in the last two sentences of this paragraph,  each original construction permit for the construction of a new TV, AM,  FM or   International Broadcast; low power TV; TV translator; TV booster; FM  translator; or FM booster station, or to make changes in such existing  stations, shall specify a period of three years from the date of  issuance of the original construction permit within which construction  shall be completed and application for license filed. Except as provided  in the last two sentences of this paragraph, each original construction  permit for the construction of a new LPFM station shall specify a period  of eighteen months from the date of issuance of the construction permit  within which construction shall be completed and application for license  filed. A LPFM permittee unable to complete construction within the time  frame specified in the original construction permit may apply for an  eighteen month extension upon a showing of good cause. The LPFM  permittee must file for an extension on or before the expiration of the  construction deadline specified in the original construction permit. An  eligible entity that acquires an issued and outstanding construction  permit for a station in any of the services listed in this paragraph  shall have the time remaining on the construction permit or eighteen  months from the consummation of the assignment or transfer of control,  whichever is longer, within which to complete construction and file an  application for license. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an  ``eligible entity'' shall include any entity that qualifies as a small  business under the Small Business Administration's size standards for  its industry grouping, as set forth in 13 CFR 121 through 201, at the  time the transaction is approved by the FCC, and holds</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 30 percent or more of the stock or partnership interests and  more than 50 percent of the voting power of the corporation or  partnership that will hold the construction permit; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 15 percent or more of the stock or partnership interests and  more than 50 percent of the voting power of the corporation or  partnership that will hold the construction permit, provided that no  other person or entity owns or controls more than 25 percent of the  outstanding stock or partnership interests; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> More than 50 percent of the voting power of the corporation that  will hold the construction permit if such corporation is a publicly  traded company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The period of construction for an original construction permit  shall toll when construction is prevented by the following causes not  under the control of the permittee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction is prevented due to an act of God, defined in terms  of natural disasters (e.g., floods, tornados, hurricanes, or  earthquakes);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grant of the permit is the subject of administrative or  judicial review (i.e., petitions for reconsideration and applications  for review of the grant of a construction permit pending before the  Commission and any judicial appeal of any Commission action thereon), or  construction is delayed by any cause of action pending before any court  of competent jurisdiction relating to any necessary local, state or  federal requirement for the construction or operation of the station,  including any zoning or environmental requirement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request for international coordination, with respect to an  original construction permit for a new DTV station, has been sent to  Canada or Mexico on behalf of the station and no response from the  country affected has been received, or the licensee or permittee is  challenging the response from Canada or Mexico on the grounds that the  facility as approved would not permit the station to serve the  population that is both approved by the Commission and served by the  station's TV (analog) facility to be vacated by June 12, 2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A permittee must notify the Commission as promptly as possible  and, in any event, within 30 days, of any pertinent event covered by  paragraph (b) of this section, and provide supporting documentation. All  notifications must be filed in triplicate with the Secretary and must be  placed in the station's local public file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A permittee must notify the Commission promptly when a relevant  administrative or judicial review is resolved. Tolling resulting from an  act of God will automatically cease six   months from the date of the notification described in paragraph (c) of  this section, unless the permittee submits additional notifications at  six month intervals detailing how the act of God continues to cause  delays in construction, any construction progress, and the steps it has  taken and proposes to take to resolve any remaining impediments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any construction permit for which construction has not been  completed and for which an application for license has not been filed,  shall be automatically forfeited upon expiration without any further  affirmative cancellation by the Commission.
