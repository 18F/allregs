                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 854 provides special limitations applicable  to dividends received from a regulated investment company for purposes  of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by  individuals, the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by  corporations, and, in the case of dividends received by individuals  before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> and paragraph (c)  of Sec. 1.852-4 shall not be considered a dividend for purposes of the  exclusion under section 116, the deduction under section 243, and, in  the case of taxable years ending before January 1, 1965, the credit  under section 34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rule for dividends other than capital gain dividends. (1)  Section 854(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> limits the amount that may be treated as a dividend  (other than a capital gain dividend) by the shareholder of a regulated  investment company, for the purposes of the credit, exclusion, and  deduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section, where the  investment company receives substantial amounts of income (such as  interest, etc.) from sources other than dividends from domestic  corporations, which dividends qualify for the exclusion under section  116.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the ``aggregate dividends received'' (as defined in  section   854(b)(3)(B) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.854-3) during the taxable year  by a regulated investment company (which meets the requirements of  section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.852-1 for the taxable year  during which it paid such dividend) are less than 75 percent of its  gross income for such taxable year (as defined in section 854(b)(3)(A)  and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.854-3), only that portion of the dividend  paid by the regulated investment company which bears the same ratio to  the amount of such dividend paid as the aggregate dividends received by  the regulated investment company, during the taxable year, bears to its  gross income for such taxable year (computed without regard to gains  from the sale or other disposition of stocks or securities) may be  treated as a dividend for purposes of such credit, exclusion, and  deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. The XYZ regulated investment company meets the requirements  of section 852(a) for the taxable year and has received income from the  following sources:  Capital gains (from the sale of stock or securities).........   $100,000 Dividends (from domestic sources other than dividends             70,000</p><p class="depth3">described in section 116(b))................................ Dividend (from foreign corporations).........................      5,000 Interest.....................................................     25,000</p><p class="depth3">----------</p><p class="depth3">Total.......................................................    200,000 Expenses.....................................................     20,000</p><p class="depth3">---------- Taxable income...............................................    180,000</p><p class="depth3">The regulated investment company decides to distribute the entire  $180,000. It distributes a capital gain dividend of $100,000 and a  dividend of ordinary income of $80,000. The aggregate dividends received  by the regulated investment company from domestic corporations ($70,000)  is less than 75 percent of its gross income ($100,000) computed without  regard to capital gains from sales of securities. Therefore, an  apportionment is required. Since $70,000 is 70 percent of $100,000, out  of every $1 dividend of ordinary income paid by the regulated investment  company only 70 cents would be available for the credit, exclusion, or  deduction referred to in section 854(b)(1). The capital gains dividend  and the dividend received from foreign corporations are excluded from  the computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dividends received from a regulated investment company during  taxable years of shareholders ending after July 31, 1954, and subject to  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. For the application of section 854 to  taxable years of shareholders of a regulated investment company ending  after July 31, 1954, and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,  see Sec. 1.34-5 and Sec. 1.116-2.
