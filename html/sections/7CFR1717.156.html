                            <p class="depth0">The fund advance period for an insured loan, which is the period during which RUS may advance loan funds to a borrower, terminates automatically after a specific period of time. See 7 CFR 1714.56. If, on the effective date the original fund advance period or the fund advance period as extended pursuant to 7 CFR 1714.56(c), on any preexisting RUS loan to any of the active borrowers involved in a merger has not terminated, such fund advance period shall be automatically lengthened by 2 years. On the borrower's request RUS will prepare documents necessary for the advance of loan funds. RUS will prepare documents for the borrower's execution that will reflect this extension and will provide the legal authority for RUS to advance funds to the successor.</p>
