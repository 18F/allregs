                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. HUD will review the performance of each participating  jurisdiction in carrying out its responsibilities under this part  whenever determined necessary by HUD, but at least annually. In  conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information  obtained from the participating jurisdiction's and, as appropriate, the  State recipient's records and reports, findings from on-site monitoring,  audit reports, and information generated from the disbursement and  information system established by HUD. Where applicable, HUD may also  consider relevant information pertaining to a participating  jurisdiction's or State recipient's performance gained from other  sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and  litigation. Reviews to determine compliance with specific requirements  of this part will be conducted as necessary, with or without prior  notice to the participating jurisdiction or State recipient.  Comprehensive performance reviews under the standards in paragraph (b)  of this section will be conducted after prior notice to the  participating jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for comprehensive performance review. A participating  jurisdiction's performance will be comprehensively reviewed  periodically, as prescribed by HUD, to determine:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For local participating jurisdictions and State participating  jurisdictions administering their own HOME programs, whether the  participating jurisdiction has committed the HOME funds in the United  States Treasury account as required by Sec. 92.500 and expended the  funds in the United States Treasury account as required by Sec. 92.500,  and has met the requirements of this part, particularly eligible  activities, income targeting, affordability, and matching requirements;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For State participating jurisdictions distributing HOME funds to  State recipients, whether the State has met the matching contribution  and other requirements of this part; has distributed the funds in  accordance with the requirements of this part; and has made such reviews  and audits of its State recipients as may be appropriate to determine  whether they have satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p>
