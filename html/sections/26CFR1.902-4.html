                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a domestic shareholder receives a distribution  from a first-tier corporation before January 1, 1978, in a taxable year  of the domestic shareholder beginning after December 31, 1964, which is  attributable to accumulated profits of the first-tier corporation for a  taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, in which the first-tier  corporation was a less developed country corporation (as defined in 26  CFR Sec. 1.902-2 revised as of April 1, 1978), then the amount of the  credit deemed paid by the domestic shareholder with respect to such  distribution shall be calculated under the rules relating to less  developed country corporations contained in (26 CFR Sec. 1.902-1  revised as of April 1, 1978).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, shall be computed as specified in Sec.  1.902-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Distributions of a first-tier corporation attributable to  certain distributions from second- or third-tier corporations.

The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a domestic corporation owns all of the one class of  stock of foreign corporation A. Both corporations use the calendar year  as the taxable year. A Corporation pays a dividend to M Corporation on  January 1, 1977, partly out of its accumulated profits for calendar year  1976 and partly out of its accumulated profits for calendar year 1975.  For 1975 A Corporation qualified as a less developed country corporation  under the former section 902(d) (as in effect on December 31, 1975). M  Corporation is deemed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to  have paid $63 of foreign income taxes paid by A Corporation on or with  respect to its accumulated profits for 1976 and 1975 and M Corporation  includes $36 of that amount in gross income as a dividend under section  78, determined as follows upon the basis of the facts assumed:</p><p class="depth0">1976 Gains, profits, and income of A Corp. for 1976...............    $120.00 Foreign income taxes imposed on or with respect to such            36.00</p><p class="depth0">gains, profits, and income..................................</p><p class="depth0">Accumulated profits..........................................     120.00 Foreign income taxes paid by A Corp. on or with respect to         36.00</p><p class="depth0">its accumulated profits (total foreign income taxes)........

The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the  distribution from A Corporation to M Corporation on January 1, 1977, was  from accumulated profits of A Corporation for 1976. A Corporation's  accumulated profits for 1976 were made up of income from its trade or  business, and a dividend paid by B, a second-tier corporation in 1976.  The dividend from B Corporation to A Corporation was from accumulated  profits of B Corporation for 1975. A Corporation would have qualified as  a less developed country corporation for 1976 under the former section  902(d) (as in effect on December 31, 1975). M Corporation is deemed  under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to have paid $543 of the  foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by A Corporation on or with respect to  its accumulated profits for 1976, and M Corporation includes $360 of  that amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78, determined  as follows upon the basis of the facts assumed:  Total gains, profits, and income of A Corp. for 1976..........    $1,500</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Gains and profits from business operations..................     1,200</p><p class="depth0">Gains and profits from dividend A Corp. received in 1976           300</p><p class="depth0">from B Corp. out of accumulated profits of B Corp. for 1975</p><p class="depth0">--------- Foreign taxes imposed on or with respect to such profits and         450</p><p class="depth0">income.......................................................</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Foreign taxes paid by A Corp. attributable to gains and            360</p><p class="depth0">profits from A Corp.'s business operations.................</p><p class="depth0">Foreign taxes paid by A Corp. attributable to dividend from         90</p><p class="depth0">B Corp. in 1976............................................</p><p class="depth0">--------- Dividends from A Corp. to M Corp. on Jan. 1, 1977.............     1,050</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Portion of dividend attributable to gains and profits of A         840</p><p class="depth0">Corp. from business operations.
