(1) The name ``Library of Congress,'' or any abbreviation or subset such as ``Copyright Office'' or ``Congressional Research Service,'' thereof, is used officially to represent the Library of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof.

The use of the Library's name, explicitly or implicitly to endorse a product or service, or materials in any publication is prohibited, except as provided for in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name ``Library of Congress,'' or any abbreviation or subset such as ``Copyright Office'' or ``Congressional Research Service,'' thereof, is used officially to represent the Library of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof.

The use of the Library's name, explicitly or implicitly to endorse a product or service, or materials in any publication is prohibited, except as provided for in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Library of Congress seal symbolizes the Library's authority and standing as an official agency of the U.S. Government. As such, it shall be displayed only on official documents or publications of the Library. The seal of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress. The seal of the National Film Preservation Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress. Procedures governing the use of any Library of Congress logo or symbol are set out below.

Use of the Library name or logo in any context suggesting an explicit or implicit endorsement may be approved in only those instances where the Library has sufficient control over the publication to make changes necessary to reflect Library expertise.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Library officers working on cooperative projects shall notify all collaborators of Library policy in writing if the collaboration is arranged through an exchange of correspondence. All uses of the Library of Congress's name, seal or logo on promotional materials must be approved by the Public Affairs Officer, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, in advance. A statement of Library policy shall be incorporated into the agreement if the terms of the collaboration are embodied in any written instrument, such as a contract or letter of understanding. The statement could read as follows:</p><p class="depth4">Name of partner recognizes the great value, prestige and goodwill associated with the name, ``Library of Congress'' and any logo pertaining thereto. Name of partner agrees not to knowingly harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute the name or logo of the Library of Congress, and further to assist the Library, as it may reasonably request, in preserving all rights, integrity and dignity associated with its name. Subject to the Library's prior written approval over all aspects of the use and presentation of the Library's name and logo, the Name of Partner may use the name of the Library of Congress in connection with publication, distribution, packaging, advertising, publicity and promotion of the ------------, produced as a result of this Agreement.

Items not involving new packaging shall be accompanied by a printed description

of the Library and its mission, with Library logo, as well as the rationale for operating a gift shop program in a statement such as, ``Proceeds from gift shop sales are used to support the Library collections and to further the Library's educational mission.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic Users.
