                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tests. All tests, including the retests, shall be conducted at  the National Bureau of Standards or other laboratories designated by the  Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of test specimen. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test specimens shall be  conditioned to approximately constant weight with the air being  maintained at a relative humidity of 40 to 70 percent and a temperature  of 15[deg] to 25 [deg]C. (59[deg] to 77 [deg]F.). After conditioning,  but before testing, the temperature of the specimen should not exceed 40  [deg]C. (104 [deg]F.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specimens shall be mounted in the furnace in a vertical  position in such a way as to give an exposed surface of at least 4.65  square meters (50 square feet) and a height of at least 2.44 meters (8  feet).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The specimen shall be supported at the top and secured on the  vertical sides and at the bottom in a manner representative of  conditions in service. If provision for movement at the edges of a  bulkhead panel is made for a particular construction in service, the  specimen should stimulate these conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The method of securing shall be such that there is no  possibility of misinterpretation of test results due to the passage of  flame at the edges of the specimen when the method of fixing is not the  subject of the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Furnace control. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The furnace temperature shall be determined  by at least four mineral insulated thermocouples having rapid response  and distributed so as to represent fairly the furnace temperature and to  insure as uniform heating as possible. The thermocouples shall be  arranged so that the hot junction is approximately 10 cm. (4)  from the nearest point of the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The furnace temperature shall be continuously controlled so as  to follow the standard time-temperature curve within the accuracy  specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve  drawn through the following points:  At the beginning of the test, 20 [deg]C. (68 [deg]F.). At the end of the first 5 minutes, 538 [deg]C. (1,000 [deg]F.). At the end of the first 10 minutes, 704 [deg]C. (1,300 [deg]F.). At the end of the first 30 minutes, 843 [deg]C. (1,550 [deg]F.). At the end of the first 60 minutes, 927 [deg]C. (1,700 [deg]F.).   For a further definition of the time-temperature curve, see Appendix I  of the ASTM Standard E119, ``Fire Tests of Building Construction and  Materials''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The accuracy of the furnace control shall be such that the area  under the mean time-temperature curve is within 15 percent of the area  under the standard curve during the first 10 minutes of the test, within  10 percent during the first one-half hour, and within 5 percent for any  period after the first one-half hour. At any time after the first 10  minutes of the test the mean furnace temperature shall not differ from  the standard curve by more than 100 [deg]C. (180 [deg]F.). Consideration  will be given to adjusting the results for variation of the furnace  exposure from that prescribed. If corrections are made,   they shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in ASTM E-119.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The pressure in the furnace shall be equal to that in the  laboratory at about one-third of the height of the specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Temperature of unexposed surface. For the unexposed surface  temperature measurement, a thermocouple of 0.5 mm. (0.020)  diameter wires shall be soldered centrally with high temperature solder  to one surface of a disc of copper 12 mm. diameter and 0.2 mm. thick.  The discs shall be covered with an oven-dry asbestos pad 50 mm. x 50 mm.  and 4 mm. thick. The disc and the pad may be fixed to the surface of the  specimen by pins, tape or a suitable adhesive, depending on the nature  of the specimen material. The asbestos pad shall have a density of  approximately 1,000 kg./m.\3\ and thermal conductivity of 0.11 kcal./m./ hr. x C. at 100 [deg]C. (212 [deg]F.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Flame penetration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where cracks or openings are formed  during the test, an ignition test as prescribed in Sec. 164.008-4(b)  shall take place immediately after the appearance of cracks or damage,  followed by similar tests at frequent intervals. The purpose of the test  is to indicate whether cracks and openings formed during the test are  such that they would lead to passage of flame.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cotton wool used for the tests prescribed in Sec. 164.008- 4(b) shall consist of new undyed soft fibers without any admixture of  artificial fibers, and shall be free from thread, leaf, and shell fiber  dust. A suitable material for this purpose is sold in the form of rolls  for surgical use. A pad shall be cut measuring 10 cm. x 10 cm.  approximately 2 cm. thick and weighing between 3 and 4 grams. It shall  be oven-dried prior to the test. The pad shall be attached by means of  wire clips to a 10 cm. x 10 cm. frame of 1 mm. diameter. A wire handle  approximately 75 cm. long attached to the frame would facilitate its use  on the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When testing for cracks or openings during the test, the pad  shall be held in a vertical position facing the crack or opening with  the aperture located in a central part of the cotton wool. The pad may  be reused if it has not absorbed any moisture or become charred during  the previous application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Temperature observations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All observations shall be taken at  intervals not exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperatures on the  unexposed side of the test specimen shall be measured by thermocouples  located as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One thermocouple located approximately in the center of each  quadrant of the steel plate (four thermocouples total).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One thermocouple close to the center of the test specimen, but  away from the joint, if any.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least one thermocouple at the vertical joint of the test  specimen.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Further thermocouples at the discretion of the testing  laboratory or Coast Guard for the purpose of determining the temperature  at points deemed likely to give a greater temperature rise than any of  the above mentioned thermocouples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall be  obtained by averaging the readings of the thermocouples mentioned in  paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other observations. Throughout the test, observations shall be  made of all changes and occurrences, which are not criteria of  performance but which may create hazard in case of a fire; for example  the emission of appreciable volumes of smoke or noxious vapors from the  unexposed side of the test specimen. The specimen shall be examined  after the test for changes that have taken place and the information  shall be noted in the test report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duration of testing. The test shall be continued for at least 30  minutes to meet the requirements of Sec. 164.008-2(b) or at least 60  minutes to meet the requirements of Sec. 164.008-2(c). In either case,  the test shall be continued until the maximum surface temperature rise  values noted in Sec. 164.008-4(a) have been reached, or until cracks  which lead to flaming as specified in Sec. 164.008-4(b) are formed.</p>
