                            <p class="depth0">If FMCSA determines that a State is not in substantial compliance with Sec. 384.209, or if FMCSA issues a decertification order prohibiting a State from issuing commercial driver's licenses, FMCSA will notify commercial learner's permit and commercial driver's license holders of these actions by publication of a Federal Register notice. The notification will advise commercial learner's permit and commercial driver's license holders that they must comply with the self-reporting requirements of Sec. 383.31(a) with respect to convictions obtained in that State until such time that FMCSA determines the State to be in substantial compliance.
