                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compliance schedule. The owner or operator shall monitor all  connectors in each process unit initially for leaks by the later of  either 12 months after the compliance date as specified in a referencing  subpart or 12 months after initial startup. If all connectors in each  process unit have been monitored for leaks prior to the compliance date  specified in the referencing subpart, no initial monitoring is required  provided either no process changes have been made since the monitoring  or the owner or operator can determine that the results of the  monitoring, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance  despite process changes. If required to monitor because of a process  change, the owner or operator is required to monitor only those  connectors involved in the process change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring method. The connectors shall be monitored to detect  leaks by the method specified in Sec.  63.1023(b) and, as applicable,  Sec.  63.1023(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instrument reading that defines a leak. If an instrument reading  greater than or equal to 500 parts per million is measured, a leak is  detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this section using the  monitoring results from the preceding monitoring period. The percent  leaking connectors shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was  greater than or equal to 0.5 percent, then monitor within 12 months (1  year).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was  greater than or equal to 0.25 percent but less than 0.5 percent, then  monitor within 4 years. An owner or operator may comply with the  requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the  connectors within 2 years of the start of the monitoring period,  provided all connectors have been monitored by the end of the 4 year  monitoring period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(C)</em> of  this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An owner or operator shall monitor at least 50 percent of the  connectors within 4 years of the start of the monitoring period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the percent leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring  results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is greater than or  equal to 0.35 percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator  shall monitor as soon as practical, but within the next 6 months, all  connectors that have not yet been monitored during the monitoring  period. At the conclusion of monitoring, a new monitoring period shall  be started pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, based on the  percent leaking connectors of the total monitored connectors.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the percent leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring  results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is less than 0.35  percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator shall monitor  all connectors   that have not yet been monitored within 8 years of the start of the  monitoring period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If, during the monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph  (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this section, a connector is found to  be leaking, it shall be re-monitored once within 90 days after repair to  confirm that it is not leaking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The owner or operator shall keep a record of the start date and  end date of each monitoring period under this section for each process  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Percent leaking connectors calculation. For use in determining  the monitoring frequency, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of  this section, the percent leaking connectors as used in paragraphs (a)  and (b)(3) of this section shall be calculated by using equation number  4. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN99.013  Where:  %CL = Percent leaking connectors as determined through</p><p class="depth2">periodic monitoring required in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth2">through (b)(3)(iii) of this section. CL = Number of connectors measured at 500 parts per million</p><p class="depth2">or greater, by the method specified in Sec.  63.1023(b). Ct = Total number of monitored connectors in the process unit</p><p class="depth2">or affected facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Leak repair. If a leak is detected pursuant to paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the  procedures in Sec.  63.1024, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special provisions for connectors--(1) Unsafe-to-monitor  connectors. Any connector that is designated, as described in Sec.   63.1022(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, as an unsafe-to-monitor connector is exempt from the  requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the owner or  operator shall monitor according to the written plan specified in Sec.   63.1022(c)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(F)</em> of  this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Buried;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Insulated in a manner that prevents access to the connector by a  monitor probe;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the  connector by a monitor probe;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic- type scaffold that would allow access to connectors up to 7.6 meters (25  feet) above the ground.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Inaccessible because it would require elevating the monitoring  personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a permanent support surface  or would require the erection of scaffold;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform  monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a  wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a  motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists,  or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical  lines, or would risk damage to equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If any inaccessible, ceramic or ceramic-lined connector is  observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to be leaking,  the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak to the  atmosphere shall be eliminated as soon as practical.</p>
