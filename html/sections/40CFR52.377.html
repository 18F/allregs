                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on December 30, 1997  and January 7, 1998. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying  the rate of progress requirement of section   182(c)(2) through 1999, and the contingency measure requirements of  sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Greater  Hartford serious ozone nonattainment area, and the Connecticut portion  of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Approval--Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted  by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on September  16, 1998, February 8, 2000 and June 17, 2003. The revisions are for the  purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of  section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the Greater Connecticut  serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes an attainment  date of November 15, 2007 for the Greater Connecticut serious ozone  nonattainment area. Connecticut commits to conduct a mid-course review  to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved toward the goal of  attainment by 2007, and submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004.  The June 17, 2003 revision establishes MOBILE6-based motor vehicle  emissions budgets for 2007 of 51.9 tons per day of volatile organic  compounds (VOC) and 98.4 tons per day of nitrogen oxides  (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Greater  Connecticut serious ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(9)</em> of the Clean Air Act, for the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT  severe ozone nonattainment area. The October 15, 2001 revision  establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2002 of 15.20 tons per  day of VOC and 38.39 tons per day of NOX to be used in  transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT  severe ozone nonattainment area.

The  revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration  requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the  Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area. The  June 17, 2003 revision establishes MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions  budgets for 2007 of 16.4 tons per day of VOC and 29.7 tons per day of  NOX to be used in transportation conformity in the  Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area.  Connecticut commits to adopt and submit by October 31, 2001, additional  necessary regional control measures to offset the emission reduction  shortfall in order to attain the one-hour ozone standard by November  2007. Connecticut commits to adopt and submit by October 31, 2001,  additional necessary intrastate control measures to offset the emission  reduction shortfall in order to attain the one-hour ozone standard by  November 2007. Connecticut commits to adopt and submit additional  restrictions on VOC emissions from mobile equipment and repair  operations; and requirements to reduce VOC emissions from certain  consumer products. Connecticut also commits to conduct a mid-course  review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved toward the  goal of attainment by 2007, and submit the results to EPA by December  31, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Commitment Fulfillment--Connecticut has fulfilled the commitment  in section 52.377(d), to adopt additional NOX and VOC control  measures to meet the emission reduction shortfall in its 1-hour severe  ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective September 30, 2010, EPA  is determining that the Greater Connecticut 8-hour ozone nonattainment  area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions  of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see   40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further  progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1)  and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for  as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour  ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in  the Greater Connecticut 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this  determination shall no longer apply.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for  the 1997 ozone standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Approval--Submittal from the Connecticut Department of  Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the Clean  Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone National  Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This submittal satisfies the  requirements of CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (E), (F), (G), (H),  (J), (K), (L), and (M).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Conditional Approval--Submittal from the Connecticut Department  of Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the  Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone  National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). On May 2, 2011, the State  of Connecticut supplemented this submittal with a commitment to address  the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the CAA that requires  notification of affected states for Prevention of Significant  Deterioration purposes. EPA is conditionally approving Connecticut's  submittal with respect to CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard.  Effective April 16, 2012, EPA is determining that the Greater  Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its  applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on  2005-2007 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data. Separate from  and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the  Greater Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour  ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone  monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. EPA's review of the  ozone data shows that the area began attaining the one-hour ozone  standard during the 2006-2008 monitoring period, and has continued  attaining the one-hour standard through the 2007-2009 and 2008-2010  monitoring periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard.  Effective July 18, 2012, EPA is determining that the New York-Northern  New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did  not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15,  2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, quality-assured and certified ozone  monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination,  EPA is determining that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island  (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour  ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured and  certified ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area and  data showing the area continued to attain through 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Determination of Attainment for the Eight-Hour Ozone Standard.  Effective July 18, 2012 EPA is determining, that complete, quality- assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2007-2009 show the NY- NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1997 eight-hour  ozone standard by its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline. Therefore, EPA  has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to  determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment  date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that  the NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to  attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A). EPA  is also determining that the NY-NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment  area currently continues to attain the eight-hour ozone NAAQS, based on  complete, quality-assured and certified data for 2008-2010 and data  through 2011. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918,  suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment  demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a  reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other  planning   SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area  continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Approval--Revisions to the Connecticut State Implementation Plan  (SIP) submitted on December 8, 2006. The SIP revision satisfies the  requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT)  for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen  (NOX) for purposes of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.  Specifically, the following sections of the Regulations of Connecticut  State Agencies are approved for this purpose: For VOC RACT, 22a-174-20,  Control of Organic Compound Emissions, 22a-174-30, Dispensing of  Gasoline/Stage I and Stage II Vapor Recovery, and 22a-174-32, RACT for  Organic Compounds; for NOX RACT, 22a-174-22, Control of  Nitrogen Oxide Emissions, and 22a-174-38, Municipal Waste Combustors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(xlii)</em> of this section, issued to PSEG  Power Connecticut, LLC in Bridgeport, Connecticut on February 12, 2003.
