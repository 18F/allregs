The national response system (NRS) is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS is composed of the National Response Team (NRT), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), On-scene coordinator (OSC), Area Committees, and Special Teams and related support entities. The NRS functions as an incident command system (ICS) under the direction of the OSC. Typical of an ICS, the NRS is capable of expanding or contracting to accommodate the response effort required by the size or complexity of the discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Safety of human life must be given the highest priority during every response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of response personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire or explosion, so that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container (vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse impact to the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The response must use all necessary containment and removal tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional discharges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The predesignated OSC has the responsibility to direct response actions and coordinate all other response efforts at the scene of an oil discharge or threatened discharge. The OSC monitors or directs all federal, state, local, and private removal actions, or arranges for the removal of an actual or threatened oil discharge, removing and if necessary, requesting authority to destroy a vessel. Additionally, the CWA requires the OSC to direct all federal, state, local, and private removal actions to any incident that poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cleanup responsibility for an oil discharge immediately falls on the responsible party, unless the discharge poses a substantial threat to public health or welfare. In a large percentage of oil discharges, the responsible party shall conduct the cleanup. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating determines that there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment of the United States (including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States), the Administrator or Secretary may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA including administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The responsible party is liable for costs of federal removal and damages in accordance with section 311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of the OPA, and other federal laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In those incidents where a discharge or threat of discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. The OSC shall also request immediate activation of the RRT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> During responses to any discharge the OSC may request advice or support from the

Special Teams and any local support units identified by the Area Committee. Examples include scientific advice from the Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC), technical guidance or prepositioned equipment from the District Response Group (DRG), or public information assistance from the National Strike Force (NSF).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> When an oil discharge exceeds the response capability of the region in which it occurs, transects regional boundaries, or involves a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, substantial amounts of property, or substantial threats to the natural resources, the NRT should be activated as an emergency response team. If appropriate the RRT Chairman may contact the NRT Chairman and request the NRT activation.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Components of national response system and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0">The NRS is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS organization is divided into national, regional, and area levels. The national level comprises the NRT, the National Strike Force Coordination Center (NSFCC), and the National Response Center (NRC). The regional level is comprised of the RRT. The area level is made up of the OSC, Special Teams, and Area Committees. The basic framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC retains authority.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 National.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> National planning and coordination is accomplished through the NRT. The NRT consists of representatives from the USCG, EPA, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (DOA), Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of State (DOS), Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and General Services Administration (GSA). Each agency shall designate a member to the team and sufficient alternates to ensure representation, as agency resources permit. The NRT will consider requests for membership on the NRT from other agencies. Other agencies may request membership by forwarding such requests to the chair of the NRT (see Figure 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The chair of the NRT shall be the representative of the EPA and the vice chair shall be the representative of the USCG, with the exception of periods of activation because of response action. During activation, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC. The vice chair shall maintain records of NRT activities along with national, regional, and area plans for response actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> While the NRT desires to achieve a consensus on all matters brought before it, certain matters may prove unresolvable by this means. In such cases, each agency serving as a participating agency on the NRT may be accorded one vote in NRT proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The NRT may establish such bylaws, procedures, and committees as it deems appropriate to further the purposes for which it is established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The NRT shall evaluate methods of responding to discharges, shall recommend any changes needed in the response organization, and shall recommend to the Administrator of EPA changes to the NCP designed to improve the effectiveness of the national response system, including drafting of regulatory language.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The NRT shall provide policy and program direction to the RRTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The NRT may consider and make recommendations to appropriate agencies on the training, equipping, and protection of response teams and necessary research, development, demonstration, and evaluation to improve response capabilities.

The NRC acts as the single point of contact for all pollution incident reporting, and as the NRT communications center. Notice of discharges must be made by telephone through a toll free number or a special number (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) and collect calls accepted). Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall promptly notify the OSC. The telephone report is distributed to any interested NRT member agency or federal entity that has established a written agreement or understanding with the NRC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commandant, USCG, in conjunction with other NRT agencies, provides the necessary personnel, communications, plotting facilities, and equipment for the NRC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notice of an oil discharge in an amount equal to or greater than the reportable quantity must be made immediately in accordance with 33 CFR part 153, subpart B.

NSFCC, located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, may assist the OSC by providing information on available spill removal resources, personnel, and equipment. The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical assistance, equipment, and other resources to augment the OSC staff during spill response;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a worst case discharge of oil;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assistance in locating spill response resources for both response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international computerized inventory of spill response resources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of oil, preparedness activities shall be carried out in conjunction with Area Committees as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels that of the NRT, but also includes state and local representation. The RRT provides: (1) the appropriate regional mechanism for development and coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC during such response actions; and (2) guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and NCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing team, which consists of designated representatives from each participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments (as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the incident-specific RRT, including

participation by state and local governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the designated OSC. The designated OSC manages response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs of the RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for response actions, the chair is the member agency providing the OSC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each participating agency should designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange with the RRT for representation appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to meetings of the RRT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of the OSCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide OSCs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC as specified in the RCP and ACP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and maintaining ACPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all RRT activities. Each state Governor is requested to assign an office or agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, make available, and coordinate state resources for use in response actions; and to serve as the contact point for coordination of response with local government agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) apprised of RRT activities and coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also invited to participate in such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs for the federal response to discharges, and provide technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local emergency planning committee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations, and recommend improvements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations of response operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Encourage the state and local response community to improve its preparedness for response;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In coordination with the Area Committee and in accordance with any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents in accordance with subpart J of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or releases outside the region;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the region;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend changes in ACPs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a year, no later than January 31 and July 31; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program for announced and unannounced exercises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(1)</em> The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific response team when a discharge:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific response team when a discharge:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC in the place where it occurs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transects state boundaries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, or to regionally significant amounts of property; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Is a worst case discharge, as defined in section 1.5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The RRT shall be activated during any discharge upon a request from the OSC, or

from any RRT representative, to the chair of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be notified immediately when the RRT is activated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency representatives will meet at the call of the chair and may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC, advise the OSC on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC specific actions to respond to the discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to respond to a discharge or to monitor response operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Help the OSC prepare information releases for the public and for communication with the NRT;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC that a different OSC should be designated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> RCPs shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may provide facilities and personnel for communications, information storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair determines that the OSC no longer requires RRT assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of regionwide response effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, it may be referred to the NRT for advice.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Area.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1 On-scene coordinator. The OSC is the federal official predesignated by EPA or the USCG to coordinate and direct federal responses under subpart D of the NCP. The USCG shall provide OSCs for oil discharges, including discharges from facilities and vessels under the jurisdiction of another federal agency, within or threatening the coastal zone. EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges into or threatening the inland zone. In carrying out a response, the OSC may direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge. In contingency planning and removal, the OSC coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, Area Committees, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, decision document, consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Area Committees shall be responsible for: (1) preparing an ACP for their areas; (2) working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to enhance the contingency planning of those officials and to assure pre-planning of joint response efforts, including appropriate procedures for mechanical recovery, dispersal, shoreline cleanup, protection of sensitive environmental areas, and protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife; and (3) working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to expedite decisions for the use of dispersants and other mitigating substances and devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The OSC is responsible for overseeing development of the ACP in the area of the OSC's responsibility.

Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any applicable international joint contingency plans shall be consistent with the NCP, to the greatest extent possible. The Department of State shall be consulted, as appropriate, prior to taking action which may affect its activities.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Regional contingency plans. The RRTs, working with the states, shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, effective response by various federal agencies and other organizations to discharges of oil. RCPs shall, as appropriate, include information on all useful facilities and resources in the region, from government, commercial, academic, and other sources. To the greatest extent possible, RCPs shall follow the format of the NCP and be coordinated with state emergency response plans, ACPs, and Title III local emergency response plans. Such coordination should be accomplished by working with the SERCs in the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall contain lines of demarcation between the inland and coastal zones,

as mutually agreed upon by the USCG and the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under the direction of an OSC and subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in consultation with the appropriate RRTs, DRGs, the NSFCC, SSCs, Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), and SERCs, shall develop an ACP for its designated area. This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and compatible to the greatest extent possible with all appropriate response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially with Title III local emergency response plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The ACP shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A description of the area covered by the plan, including the areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be impacted by a discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment), dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge, and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include such equipment lists);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A detailed description of how the plan is integrated into other ACPs and tank vessel, offshore facility, and onshore facility response plans approved by the President, and into operating procedures of the NSFCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of injury to, fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees shall incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NOAA and other interested natural resource management agencies and parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and their habitat, and shall include other areas considered sensitive environments in a separate section of the annex, based upon Area Committee recommendations. The annex shall provide the necessary information and procedures to immediately and effectively respond to discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat and sensitive environments, including provisions for a response to a worst case discharge. Such information shall include the identification of appropriate agencies and their responsibilities, procedures to notify these agencies following a discharge or threat of a discharge; protocols for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits and other necessary permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of annex-related activities with removal operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The annex shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, significant or otherwise designated protected areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to, disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent taking or disturbance of

fish and wildlife or specimens by response personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide for pre-approval of application of specific countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans must be consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section and subpart J requirements of the NCP, and must have the concurrence of the natural resource trustees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the environment. Monitoring should include ``set-aside'' or ``control'' areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no interference with other OSC removal operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and provide for required fish and wildlife handling and rehabilitation permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the capture, transport, rehabilitation, release of wildlife exposed to or threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of wildlife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the minimum required Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training for volunteers, including those who assist with injured wildlife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Evaluate the compatibility between this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels, facilities and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, and sensitive environments.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 OPA facility and vessel response plans</p><p class="depth0">This section describes and cross-references the regulations that implement section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. A tank vessel, as defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance. These response plans are required to be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans. These regulations are codified as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 155;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 CFR part 254;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For non-transportation related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 40 CFR part 112.20;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations are cofidied in 33 CFR part 154;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For pipeline facilities, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 194; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For rolling stock, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 106 et al.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Relation to others plans.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1 Federal response plans. In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the President, the FEMA may activate the Federal Response Plan (FRP). A Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO), designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). EPA coordinates activities under ESF 10--Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC should coordinate response

activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF 10 Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under CWA section 311(j)(5), tank vessels, offshore facilities, and certain onshore facilities are required to prepare and submit response plans for review and approval by the President for the carriage, storage, and transportation of oil and hazardous substances. Separate regulations published by the appropriate federal agencies provide for required response plan development and/or approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> These plans shall be developed to coordinate responsible party actions with the OSC and the ACP response strategies, for response to oil discharges within the inland and coastal zones of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Pre-approval authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be impacted by spilled oil, available product and storage locations, available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain products under specified circumstances as described in the preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products without obtaining the specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For spill situations that are not addressed by the preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the oil discharge, provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning agents on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, including products not listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, when, in the judgment of the OSC, the use of the product is necessary to prevent or substantially reduce a hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC authorizes the use of a product pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is to inform the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/DOI natural resource trustees of the use of a product, including products not on the Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to human life has subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil discharges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> When developing preauthorization plans, RRTs may require the performance of supplementary toxicity and effectiveness testing of products, in addition to the test methods specified in Sec. 300.915 and described in appendix C to part 300, due to existing site-specific or area-specific concerns.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Area response drills. The OSC periodically shall conduct drills of removal capability (including fish and wildlife response), without prior notice, in areas for which ACPs are required and under relevant tank vessel and facility response plans.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Response operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The OSC shall direct response efforts and coordinate all other efforts at the scene of a discharge. As part of the planning and preparation for response, OSCs shall be predesignated by the regional or district head of the lead agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency to arrive at the scene of a discharge should coordinate activities under the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation with the OSC, any necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC until the arrival of the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate federal OSLTF-financed actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the OSC is unavailable, the authorized representative of the lead agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The OSC shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent facts about the discharge, such as its source and cause; the identification of responsible parties; the nature, amount, and location of discharged materials; the probable direction and time of travel of discharged materials; whether the discharge is a worst case discharge; the pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact on human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare; the potential impact on natural resources and property which may be affected; priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the environment; and appropriate cost documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The OSC's efforts shall be coordinated with other appropriate federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs may designate capable persons from federal, state, or local agencies to act as their on-scene representatives. State and local governments, however, are not authorized to take actions under subpart D of the NCP that involve expenditures of the OSLTF unless an appropriate contract or cooperative agreement has been established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The OSC should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The OSC should evaluate incoming information and immediately advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The OSC is responsible for addressing worker health and safety concerns at a response scene.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> In those instances where a possible public health emergency exists, the OSC should notify the HHS representative to the RRT. Throughout response actions, the OSC may call upon the OSHA and HHS representative for assistance on worker health and safety issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and facilities under their jurisdiction. All federal agencies, therefore, are responsible for designating the office that coordinates response to such incidents in accordance with the NCP and applicable federal regulations and guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(1)</em> The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified of discharges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified of discharges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The OSC shall coordinate all response activities with the affected natural resource trustees and shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the OSC becomes aware that a discharge may affect any endangered or threatened species, or their habitat, the OSC shall consult with DOI, DOC/NOAA, and, if appropriate, the cognizant federal land managing agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The OSC shall submit pollution reports (POLREPs) to the RRT and other appropriate agencies as significant developments occur during response actions, through communications networks or procedures agreed to by the RRT and covered in the RCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> The OSC should ensure that all appropriate public and private interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered throughout a response, to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A discharge of oil may be discovered through:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A report submitted by the person in charge of a vessel or facility, in accordance with statutory requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deliberate search by patrols;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Random or incidental observation by government agencies or the public; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall, as soon as he or she has knowledge of any discharge from such vessel or facility in violation of section 311(b)(3) of the CWA, immediately notify the NRC. Notification shall be made to the NRC Duty Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-2675. If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the USCG or EPA predesignated OSC for the geographic area where the discharge occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the nearest Coast Guard unit. In any event, such person in charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any other person shall, as appropriate, notify the NRC of a discharge of oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall promptly notify the OSC. The OSC shall ensure notification of the appropriate state agency of any state which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, affected by the discharge. The OSC shall then proceed with the following phases as outlined in the RCP and ACP.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Phase II--Preliminary assessment and initiation of action</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat to public health or welfare or the environment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assess the feasibility of removal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where practicable, the framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must direct all response efforts, as provided in section 5.3.4 of this appendix. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill response participants that the federal government will direct the response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources (i.e., personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the National Pollution Funds Center for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Patterns of response.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Determinations to initiate response and special conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the CWA, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to act for the

United States to take response measures deemed necessary to protect the public health or welfare or environment from discharges of oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil is discharged or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA, including issuing administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare, if the Administrator or Secretary determines that there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment of the United States, including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Response actions to remove discharges originating from operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act shall be in accordance with the NCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Where appropriate, when a discharge involves radioactive materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act consistent with the notification and assistance procedures described in the appropriate Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) (50 FR 46542, November 8, 1985) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological discharges and releases do not result in FRERP activation and should be handled in accordance with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear incidents subject to requirements for financial protection established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments (section 170) of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from CERCLA and NCP requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request by the Governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a FCO to coordinate all federal disaster assistance activities. In such cases, the OSC would continue to carry out OSC responsibilities under the NCP, but would coordinate those activities with the FCO to ensure consistency with other federal disaster assistance activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the President, FEMA may activate the FRP. An FCO, designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as ESFs. EPA coordinates activities under ESF 10--Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF 10 Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally should be taken in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such as the threat posed to public health or welfare or the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the source of the discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Officially classify the size (i.e., minor, medium, major) and type (i.e., substantial threat to the public health or welfare, worst case discharge) of the discharge and determine the course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or welfare may be further classified as a spill of national significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of the USCG. The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in 5.3.4, 5.3.5, and 5.3.6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that proper removal action is being taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, determine whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out removal. Removal is being done properly when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The responsible party is applying the resources called for in its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible party resources with government resources, the spill response will not be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Defensive actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare or the environment. Actions may include but are not limited to: analyzing water samples to determine the source and spread of the oil; controlling the source of discharge; source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of physical barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural resources and sensitive ecosystems; measuring and sampling; control of the water discharged from upstream impoundment; and the use of chemicals and other materials in accordance with subpart J of part 300 of the NCP to restrain the spread of the oil and mitigate its effects. The ACP should be consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents shall not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and Area Committee guidelines may identify the disposal options available during an oil spill response and may describe what disposal requirements are mandatory or may not be waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should address: the sampling, testing, and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the segregation and stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal approvals and permits; and the routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled debris, and animal carcasses; procedures for obtaining waivers, exemptions, or authorizations associated with handling or transporting waste materials. The ACPs may identify a hierachy of preferences for disposal alternatives, with recycling (reprocessing) being the most preferred, and other alternatives preferred based on priorities for health or the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The OSC shall determine whether a discharge results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, the public and private beaches, and shorelines of the United States). Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the character of the discharge, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other discharges and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. In directing the response in such cases, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law

governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, the OSC shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance, including the use of the services of the NSFCC, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Request immediate activation of the RRT; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate, including but not limited to implementation of the ACP or relevant tank vessel or facility response plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the request of the OSC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A discharge may be classified as an SONS by the Administrator of EPA for discharges occurring in the inland zone and the Commandant of the USCG for discharges occurring in the coastal zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For an SONS in the inland zone, the EPA Administrator may name a senior Agency official to assist the OSC in: (1) Communicating with affected parties and the public; and (2) coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For an SONS in the coastal zone, the USCG Commandant may name a National Incident Commander (NIC) who will assume the role of the OSC in: (1) Communicating with affected parties and the public; and (2) coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination shall involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the investigation by the OSC shows that a discharge is a worst case discharge as defined in the ACP, or there is a substantial threat of such a discharge, the OSC shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notify the NSFCC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case portion of an approved tank vessel or facility response plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Implement the worst case portion of the ACP, if appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, to remove a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If a discharge moves from the area covered by one ACP or RCP into another area, the authority for response actions should likewise shift. If a discharge affects areas covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> There shall be only one OSC at any time during the course of a response operation. Should a discharge affect two or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC. The RRT shall designate the OSC if the RRT member agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Response actions under the NCP shall comply with the provisions for response action worker safety and health in 29 CFR 1910.120.

The term adjacent means bordering, contiguous, or neighboring a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition, including waters separated by constructed dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, and the like. For purposes of adjacency, an open water such as a pond or lake includes any wetlands within or abutting its ordinary high water mark. Adjacency is not limited to waters located laterally to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. Adjacent waters also include all waters that connect segments of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) or are located at the head of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and are bordering, contiguous, or neighboring such water. Waters being used for established normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)) are not adjacent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Neighboring. The term neighboring means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All waters located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and not more than 1,500 feet from the ordinary high water mark of such water. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark and within the 100-year floodplain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) or (1)(iii) of this definition, and all waters within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tributary and tributaries. The terms tributary and tributaries each mean a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water (including an impoundment identified in paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition), to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark. These physical indicators demonstrate there is volume, frequency, and duration of flow sufficient to create a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark, and thus to qualify as a tributary. A tributary can be a natural, man-altered, or man-made water and includes waters such as rivers, streams, canals, and ditches not excluded under paragraph (2) of this definition. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if, for any length, there are one or more constructed breaks (such as bridges, culverts, pipes, or dams), or one or more natural breaks (such as wetlands along the run of a stream, debris piles, boulder fields, or a stream that flows underground) so long as a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark can be identified upstream of the break. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if it contributes flow through a water of the

United States that does not meet the definition of tributary or through a non-jurisdictional water to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Wetlands. The term wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Significant nexus. The term significant nexus means that a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. The term ``in the region'' means the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. For an effect to be significant, it must be more than speculative or insubstantial. Waters are similarly situated when they function alike and are sufficiently close to function together in affecting downstream waters. For purposes of determining whether or not a water has a significant nexus, the water's effect on downstream (1)(i) through (iii) waters shall be assessed by evaluating the aquatic functions identified in paragraphs (3)(v)(A) through (I) of this definition. A water has a significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. Functions relevant to the significant nexus evaluation are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sediment trapping,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nutrient recycling,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Retention and attenuation of flood waters,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Runoff storage,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Contribution of flow,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Export of organic matter,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Export of food resources, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ordinary high water mark. The term ordinary high water mark means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> High tide line. The term high tide line means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.</p>
