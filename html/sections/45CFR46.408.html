                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the determinations required under other  applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine that  adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children,  when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing  assent. In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the  IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state  of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to  be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child,  as the IRB   deems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or  all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be  consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research  holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health  or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of  the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary condition  for proceeding with the research. Even where the IRB determines that the  subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent  requirement under circumstances in which consent may be waived in accord  with Sec. 46.116 of Subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the determinations required under other  applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine, in  accordance with and to the extent that consent is required by Sec.  46.116 of Subpart A, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting  the permission of each child's parents or guardian. Where parental  permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of  one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under Sec. 46.404  or Sec. 46.405. Where research is covered by Sec. Sec. 46.406 and  46.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must  give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown,  incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has  legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in Sec.  46.116 of Subpart A, if the IRB determines that a research protocol is  designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental  or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the  subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the  consent requirements in Subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of this  section, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children  who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and  provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, state  or local law. The choice of an appropriate mechanism would depend upon  the nature and purpose of the activities described in the protocol, the  risk and anticipated benefit to the research subjects, and their age,  maturity, status, and condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permission by parents or guardians shall be documented in  accordance with and to the extent required by Sec. 46.117 of Subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also  determine whether and how assent must be documented.</p>
