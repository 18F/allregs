Hospitals include diagnostic and major surgery facilities but exclude doctor's offices, clinics, or other facilities whose primary purpose is to provide medical services to humans or animals on an outpatient basis.</p><p class="depth0">Hospital central services staff means a healthcare professional, including manager and technician, who is either directly involved in or responsible for sterile processing at a hospital.</p><p class="depth0">Medically necessary means circumstances that a hospital central services staff, a hospital administrator, or a physician concludes, based on generally accepted medical practices, necessitate sterilizing without a full load in order to protect human health.</p><p class="depth0">State or local regulation means a regulation at the State or local level that requires a hospital to reduce the quantity of ethylene oxide emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization units.</p><p class="depth0">Sterilization facility means the group of ethylene oxide sterilization units at a hospital using ethylene oxide gas or an ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the purpose of sterilizing.</p><p class="depth0">Sterilization process means any time when ethylene oxide is removed from the sterilization unit or combination sterilization unit through the sterilization unit vent.</p><p class="depth0">Sterilization unit means any enclosed vessel that is filled with ethylene oxide gas or an ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the purpose of sterilizing. As used in this subpart, the term includes combination sterilization units.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
