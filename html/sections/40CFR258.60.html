The closure plan, at a minimum, must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the final cover, designed in accordance with Sec. 258.60(a) and the methods and procedures to be used to install the cover;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An estimate of the largest area of the MSWLF unit ever requiring a final cover as required under Sec. 258.60(a) at any time during the active life;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the maximum inventory of wastes ever on-site over the active life of the landfill facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A schedule for completing all activities necessary to satisfy the closure criteria in Sec. 258.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator must notify the State Director that a closure plan has been prepared and placed in the operating record no later than the effective date of this part, or by the initial receipt of waste, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior to beginning closure of each MSWLF unit as specified in Sec. 258.60(f), an owner or operator must notify the State Director that a notice of the intent to close the unit has been placed in the operating record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator must begin closure activities of each MSWLF unit no later than 30 days after the date on which the MSWLF unit receives the known final receipt of wastes or, if the MSWLF unit has remaining capacity and there is a reasonable likelihood that the MSWLF unit will receive additional wastes, no later than one year after the most recent receipt of wastes.

180 days following the beginning of closure as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
