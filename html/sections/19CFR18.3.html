                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When bonded merchandise in one conveyance is to be transshipped  under Customs supervision to another single conveyance while en route to  the port of destination or exportation, the in-bond document which  accompanied the merchandise shall be presented to the port director at  the place of transshipment for execution of a certificate of transfer  thereon. The in-bond document shall be returned to the carrier to  accompany the merchandise to the port of destination or exportation.  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, merchandise covered  by a TIR carnet shall not be transshipped if the transshipment involves  the unlading of the merchandise from a container or road vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> shall prepare for each  such conveyance two additional copies of the Customs Form 7512 which  accompanied the merchandise to the place of transshipment. The Customs  Form 7512 which accompanied the shipment to the place of transshipment  shall be presented to the port director there. The Customs officer  supervising the transshipment shall execute a certificate of transfer on  all copies of the Customs Form 7512. The original copies of the Customs  Form 7512 shall be delivered to the conductor, master, or person in  charge of the first conveyance. Two additional copies of the Customs  Form 7512 shall be delivered to the person in charge of each additional  conveyance in which the merchandise is forwarded for delivery to the  director of the port of destination or exportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Merchandise covered by a TIR carnet may be transshipped in a  case involving the unlading of the merchandise from a container or road  vehicle only if the transshipment is necessitated by casualty en route.  In the event of transshipment, a TIR approved container or road vehicle  shall be used if available. If the transshipment takes place under  Customs supervision, the Customs officer shall excute a certificate of  transfer on the appropriate TIR carnet voucher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If it becomes necessary at any point in transit to remove the  Customs seals from a conveyance or container containing bonded  merchandise for the purpose of transferring its contents to   another conveyance or container, or to gain access to the shipment  because of casualty or for other good reason, and it cannot be done  under Customs supervision because of the element of time involved or  because there is no Customs officer stationed at such point, a  responsible agent of the carrier may remove the seals, supervise the  transfer or handling of the merchandise, seal the conveyance or  container in which the shipment goes forward, and make appropriate  notation of his action on the conductor's or master's copy of the  manifest, or the outside back cover of the TIR carnet, including the  date, serial numbers of the new seals applied, and the reason therefor.  This authorization shall not apply in any case not involving a real  emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All transfers to or from the conveyance or warehouse of  merchandise undergoing transportation in bond shall be made under the  provisions of part 125 of this chapter and at the expense of the parties  in interest, unless the bond of the carrier on Customs Form 301,  containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.63 of this chapter  or a TIR carnet is liable for the safekeeping and delivery of the  merchandise while it is being transferred.
