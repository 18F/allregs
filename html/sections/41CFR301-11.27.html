                            <p class="depth0">No. Lodging taxes paid by you are reimbursable as a miscellaneous  travel expense limited to the taxes on reimbursable lodging costs. For  example, if your agency authorizes you a maximum lodging rate of $50 per  night, and you elect to stay at a hotel that costs $100 per night, you  can only claim the amount of taxes on $50, which is the maximum  authorized lodging amount. This section is effective January 1, 1999,  for CONUS locations and effective January 1, 2000, for non-foreign  areas. For foreign areas, lodging taxes have not been removed from  foreign per diem rates established by the Department of State. Separate  claims for lodging taxes incurred in foreign areas are not allowed.  [FTR Amdt. 75, 63 FR 66675, Dec. 2, 1998, as amended by FTR Amdt. 108,  67 FR 57965, Sept. 13, 2002]</p>
