                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of the regulations in this subchapter apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in Sec. 331.2 under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each establishment located in such a designated State shall be granted inspection required under Sec. 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 305.2 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under Sec. 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter, except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of this subchapter. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations in this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sections 416.2(c), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this chapter shall apply to such establishments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 314.2 of this subchapter shall apply to such establishments, except that a separate room or compartment need not be provided for inedible products if they can be handled so that they do not create insanitary conditions in any room or compartment used for edible products or otherwise render any edible products adulterated and do not interfere with the conduct of inspection. For example, intestines, paunch contents, feet, and hides might be accumulated on the kill floor in

clean, watertight drums with close fitting covers if there is sufficient space to store them out of the way until the close of the day's operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sections 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter apply to such establishments, except as provided in this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operator of each such establishment will, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use, (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor of the circuit in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under Sec. Sec. 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 1(n) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The circuit supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the Washington, DC, office of the Labeling and Packaging Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by Sec. Sec. 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, or their use must be discontinued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The circuit supervisor will also review all shipping containers to insure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of self-destructive pressure sensitive tape or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of this subchapter must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sections 320.1, 320.2, 320.3, 320.4, 320.5, 325.20, and 325.21 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 301(c) only if the State is also designated under section 205 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in Sec. 331.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Section 321.1(a) of this subchapter will not apply to States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Parts 322 and 327 and Sec. 325.3 of this subchapter relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Part 325 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under Sec. 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter and to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Sections 325.4, 325.15, and 325.1(b) of this subchapter will not apply to require a certificate, or evidence thereof, for the distribution solely within any designated State of products that are U.S. inspected and passed and so marked.
