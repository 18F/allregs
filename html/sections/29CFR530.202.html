Documentation of the work measurements used to establish the piece rates, and the circumstances under which such measurements were conducted shall be retained for three years and made available on request to the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fact that an employer bases piece rates on work measurements

which indicate that the homeworkers would receive at least the minimum wage at such piece rate(s) does not relieve the employer from the Act's requirement that each homeworker actually receive not less than the minimum wage for all hours worked.</p>
