                            <p class="depth0">An applicant for ALP status must show that it substantially meets  the following criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CDC staff experience. The CDC's staff must have well-trained,  qualified loan officers who are knowledgeable concerning SBA's lending  policies and procedures for the 504 program. The CDC must have at least  one loan officer with three years of 504 loan processing experience and  at least one loan officer with three years of 504 servicing experience  or two years experience plus satisfactory completion of SBA-approved  processing and servicing training. The same loan officer may meet these  qualifications. In addition, the CDC's staff must have demonstrated  satisfactorily to SBA the ability to process and service 504 loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number of 504 loans approved and size of portfolio. SBA must  have approved at least 20 504 loan applications by the CDC in the most  recent three years, and the CDC must have a portfolio of at least 30  active 504 loans. (An ``active'' 504 loan is a loan that was approved  and closed by the CDC and has a status of either current, delinquent, or  in liquidation.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CDC reviews. CDC reviews conducted by SBA must be current  (within the last 24 months, if applicable) for applicants for ALP  status. The CDC must have received a review assessment of either  ``Acceptable'' or ``Acceptable With Corrective Actions Required.'' In  addition, the CDC must have satisfactory SBA performance, as determined  by SBA in its discretion. The CDC's Risk Rating, among other factors,  will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other  factors may include, but are not limited to, on-site review/examination  assessments, historical performance measures (like default rate,  purchase rate and loss rate), loan volume to the extent that it impacts  performance measures, and other performance related measurements and  information (such as contribution toward SBA mission);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record of compliance with 504 program requirements. The CDC must  have a record of conforming to SBA's policies and procedures and of  satisfactorily underwriting, closing and servicing 504 loans. SBA will  consider all relevant material information, which will include but is  not limited to whether the CDC meets all SBA's CDC portfolio benchmarks,  when determining the CDC's record of compliance, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission of satisfactory 504 loan analyses and applications,  and all required, and properly completed, loan documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Careful and thorough analysis and screening of all 504 loan  applications for conformance with SBA credit and eligibility standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proper completion of required 504 loan closing documents and  compliance with SBA 504 loan closing policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compliance with SBA loan servicing policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance with the certification and operational requirements  as set forth in Secs. 120.820 through 120.830.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Submission of timely, complete and acceptable annual reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compliance with CDC ethical requirements (see Sec. 120.851).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Priority CDC. The CDC must be a Priority CDC with a Designated  Attorney and SBA required insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Record of Cooperation. The CDC must have a record of effective  communication and a cooperative relationship with all SBA offices  including district offices and SBA's loan processing and servicing  centers.
