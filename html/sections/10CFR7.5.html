                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before establishing a discretionary advisory committee, the NRC shall consult with the Committee Management Secretariat. With a full understanding of the background and purpose behind the proposed advisory committee, the Committee Management Secretariat may share its knowledge and experience with the NRC on how best to make use of the proposed committee, alternate methods of attaining the agency's purpose, or whether a pre-existing advisory committee performs similar functions. Such consultation should include the transmittal of the proposed committee charter and the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for a review of the proposed charter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explanation stating why the committee is essential to the conduct of NRC business and is in the public interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An explanation stating why the committee's functions cannot be performed by the NRC, an existing NRC advisory committee, or other means (such as a public hearing); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of NRC's plan to attain balanced membership on the committee. The plan must ensure that, in the selection of members for the advisory committee, the NRC will consider a cross-section of those directly affected, interested, and qualified, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the committee. For purposes of attaining balance in an NRC advisory committee's membership, the Commission shall consider for membership interested persons and groups with professional, technical, or personal qualifications or experience that will contribute to the functions and tasks to be performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each proposed committee charter submitted for review pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The committee's official designation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The committee's objectives and the scope of its activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out its purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The NRC official to whom the committee will report;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The NRC office responsible for providing support for the committee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of the duties that the committee will perform, and if such duties are not solely advisory, a specification of the authority for the functions that are not advisory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The estimated annual operating costs, in dollars and person years, for the committee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The committee's termination date, if less than two years from the date of the committee's establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requirements of this part, including the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, shall apply to any subcommittee that functions independently of the parent advisory committee (such as by making recommendations directly to the agency rather than to the parent advisory committee), regardless of whether the subcommittee's members are drawn in whole or in part from the parent advisory committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After the Committee Management Secretariat has notified the Commission of the results of its review of a proposal to establish or utilize an NRC discretionary advisory committee, submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall notify the Committee Management Secretariat whether the advisory committee is actually being established.

Filing of the advisory committee charter pursuant to Sec. 7.8 shall be deemed to fulfill this notification requirement. If the advisory committee is not being established, the Commission shall so advise the Committee Management Secretariat, stating whether NRC intends to take any further action with respect to the proposed advisory committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The date of filing of an advisory committee charter pursuant to Sec. 7.8 shall be added to the charter when such filing takes place, shall appear on the face of the charter, and shall constitute the date of establishment, renewal, or reestablishment of the committee.
