The adjusted costs of administration of the electric regulatory program, excluding the costs of regulating the Power Marketing Agencies, will be assessed to public utilities that provide transmission service (measured, as discussed in paragraph (c) of this section, by the sum of the megawatt-hours of all unbundled transmission and the megawatt-hours of all bundled wholesale power sales (to the extent these latter megawatt-hours were not separately reported as unbundled transmission)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of annual charges to be assessed to public utilities. The costs determined under paragraph (a) of this section will be assessed as annual charges to each public utility providing transmission service based on the proportion of the megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in

interstate commerce of each such public utility in the immediately preceding reporting year (either a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on which accounting convention is used by the public utility to be charged) to the sum of the megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce in the immediately preceding reporting year of all such public utilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirement. (1) For purposes of computing annual charges, as of January 1, 2002, a public utility, as defined in Sec. 382.102(b), that provides transmission service must submit under oath to the Office of the Secretary by April 30 of each year an original and conformed copies of the following information (designated as FERC Reporting Requirement No. 582 (FERC-582)): The total megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, which for purposes of computing the annual charges and for purposes of this reporting requirement, will be measured by the sum of the megawatt-hours of all unbundled transmission (including MWh delivered in wheeling transactions and MWh delivered in exchange transactions) and the megawatt-hours of all bundled wholesale power sales (to the extent these latter megawatt-hours were not separately reported as unbundled transmission). This information must be reported to 3 decimal places; e.g., 3,105 KWh will be reported as 3.105 MWh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of computing annual charges, as of January 1, 2002, a public utility, as defined in Sec. 382.102(b), that provides transmission service must submit under oath to the Office of the Secretary by April 30 of each year an original and conformed copies of the following information (designated as FERC Reporting Requirement No. 582 (FERC-582)): The total megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, which for purposes of computing the annual charges and for purposes of this reporting requirement, will be measured by the sum of the megawatt-hours of all unbundled transmission (including MWh delivered in wheeling transactions and MWh delivered in exchange transactions) and the megawatt-hours of all bundled wholesale power sales (to the extent these latter megawatt-hours were not separately reported as unbundled transmission).
