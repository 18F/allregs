                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An applicant may withdraw an application for an exemption at any  time by oral or written (including electronic) notice to the Department.  A withdrawn application generally shall not prejudice any subsequent  applications for an exemption submitted by an applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving an applicant's notice of withdrawal regarding an  application for an individual exemption, the Department will confirm by  letter the applicant's withdrawal of the application and will terminate  all proceedings relating to the application. If a notice of proposed  exemption has been published in the Federal Register, the Department  will publish a notice withdrawing the proposed exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receiving an applicant's notice of withdrawal regarding an  application for a class exemption or for an individual exemption that is  being considered with other applications as a request for a class  exemption, the Department will inform any other applicants for the  exemption of the withdrawal. The Department will continue to process  other applications for the same exemption. If all applicants for a  particular class exemption withdraw their applications, the Department  may either terminate all proceedings relating to the exemption or  propose the exemption on its own motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, following the withdrawal of an exemption application, an  applicant decides to reapply for the same exemption, he or she may  contact the Department in writing (including electronically) to request  that the application be reinstated. The applicant should refer to the  application number assigned to the original application. If, at the time  the original application was withdrawn, any additional information to be  submitted to the Department under Sec. 2570.39 was outstanding, that  information must accompany the request for reinstatement of the  application. However, the applicant need not resubmit information  previously furnished to the Department in connection with a withdrawn  application unless reinstatement of the application is requested more  than two years after the date of its withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any request for reinstatement of a withdrawn application  submitted, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, will be  granted by the Department, and the Department will take whatever steps  remained at the time the application was withdrawn to process the  application.</p>
