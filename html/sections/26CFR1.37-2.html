                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section illustrates the computation of the  credit for the elderly in the case of an individual who has attained the  age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. This section shall not  apply to an individual for any taxable year for which the individual  makes the election described in section 37(e)(2) and paragraph (b) of  Sec.  1.37-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> and (c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The computation of the credit for the elderly for  individuals to whom this section applies may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, a single individual who is 67 years old, has adjusted  gross income of $8,000 for the calendar year 1977. A also receives  social security payments of $1,450 during 1977. A does not itemize  deductions. A's credit for the elderly is $120, computed as follows:  Initial amount under section 37(b)(2).........................    $2,500 Reductions required by section 37 (b)(3) and (c)(1):</p><p class="depth2">Social security payments........................    $1,450</p><p class="depth2">One-half the excess of adjusted gross income           250     1,700</p><p class="depth2">over $7,500....................................</p><p class="depth2">---------- Section 37 amount.............................................       800</p><p class="depth2">========= 15 pct. of $800...............................................      $120</p><p class="depth2">A's tax from the tax tables, which reflect the allowance of the general  tax credit, is $662. Accordingly, the limitation of section 37(c)(2) and  paragraph (b) of Sec.  1.37-1 does not reduce A's credit for the  elderly.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. H and W, who have both attained the age of 65, file a  joint return for calendar year 1977. For that year H and W have adjusted  gross income of $8,120; H also receives a railroad retirement pension of  $1,550, and W receives social security payments of $1,200. H and W do  not itemize deductions. The credit for the elderly allowed   to H and W for 1977 is $139, computed as follows:  Initial amount under section 37(b)(2).........................    $3,750 Reductions required by section 37 (b)(3):</p><p class="depth2">Railroad retirement pension.....................    $1,550</p><p class="depth2">Social Security payments........................     1,200     2,750</p><p class="depth2">---------- Section 37 amount.............................................     1,000</p><p class="depth2">========= 15 pct. of $1,000.............................................       150 Limitation based upon amount of tax (derived from table             $139</p><p class="depth2">reflecting allowance of general tax credit)..................</p><p class="depth2">Since the adjusted gross income of H and W is not greater than $10,000,  no reduction of the initial amount is required under section 37 (c)(1).
