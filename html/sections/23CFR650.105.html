By definition, the highway will not be inundated from the  stage of the design flood.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Encroachment shall mean an action within the limits of the base  flood plain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Floodproof shall mean to design and construct individual  buildings, facilities, and their sites to protect against structural  failure, to keep water out or to reduce the effects of water entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Freeboard shall mean the vertical clearance of the lowest  structural member of the bridge superstructure above the water surface  elevation of the overtopping flood.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Minimize shall mean to reduce to the smallest practicable amount  or degree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Natural and beneficial flood-plain values shall include but are  not limited to fish, wildlife, plants, open space, natural beauty,  scientific study, outdoor recreation, agriculture, aquaculture,  forestry, natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and  groundwater recharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Overtopping flood shall mean the flood described by the  probability of exceedance and water surface elevation at which flow  occurs over the highway, over the watershed divide, or through  structure(s) provided for emergency relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Practicable shall mean capable of being done within reasonable  natural, social, or economic constraints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Preserve shall mean to avoid modification to the functions of  the natural flood-plain environment or to maintain it as closely as  practicable in its natural state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Regulatory floodway shall mean the flood-plain area that is  reserved in an open manner by Federal, State or local requirements,  i.e., unconfined or unobstructed either horizontally or vertically, to  provide for the discharge of the base flood so that the cumulative  increase in water surface elevation is no more than a designated amount  (not to exceed 1 foot as established by the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) for administering the National Flood Insurance Program).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Restore shall mean to reestablish a setting or environment in  which the functions of the natural and beneficial flood-plain values  adversely impacted by the highway agency action can again operate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Risk shall mean the consequences associated with the probability  of flooding attributable to an encroachment. It shall include the  potential for property loss and hazard to life during the service life  of the highway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Risk analysis shall mean an economic comparison of design  alternatives using expected total costs (construction costs plus risk  costs) to determine the alternative with the least total expected cost  to the public. It shall include probable flood-related costs during the  service life of the facility for highway operation, maintenance, and  repair, for highway-aggravated flood damage to other property,   and for additional or interrupted highway travel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Significant encroachment shall mean a highway encroachment and  any direct support of likely base flood-plain development that would  involve one or more of the following construction-or flood-related  impacts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A significant potential for interruption or termination of a  transportation facility which is needed for emergency vehicles or  provides a community's only evacuation route.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A significant risk, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A significant adverse impact on natural and beneficial flood- plain values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Support base flood-plain development shall mean to encourage,  allow, serve, or otherwise facilitate additional base flood-plain  development. Direct support results from an encroachment, while indirect  support results from an action out of the base flood plain.</p>
