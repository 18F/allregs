                            <p class="depth0">Grants of up to 75 percent of the cost of developing essential  community facilities may be used to supplement financial assistance  authorized in accordance with 7 CFR parts 1942, subparts A and C, and  3575, subpart A. Eligible CFG purposes are those listed in paragraphs  (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Funding for the balance of the  project may consist of other CF financial assistance, applicant  contributions, or loans and grants from other sources. CFGs may be used  to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construct, enlarge, extend, or otherwise improve essential  community facilities providing essential service primarily to rural  residents and rural businesses. Rural businesses include facilities such  as educational and other publicly owned facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Essential community facilities'' are those public improvements  requisite to the beneficial and orderly development of a community  operated on a nonprofit basis including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fire, rescue, and public safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Health services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Community, social, or cultural services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Transportation facilities such as streets, roads, and bridges;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Hydroelectric generating facilities and related connecting  systems and appurtenances, when not eligible for RUS financing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Telecommunications equipment as it relates to medical and  educational telecommunications links;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Supplemental and supporting structures for other rural  electrification or telephone systems (including facilities such as  headquarters and office buildings, storage facilities, and maintenance  shops) when not eligible for RUS financing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Natural gas distribution systems; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Industrial park sites, but only to the extent of land  acquisition and necessary site preparation, including access ways and  utility extensions to and throughout the site. Funds may not be used in  connection with industrial parks to finance on-site utility systems, or  business and industrial buildings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Otherwise improve'' includes, but is not limited to, the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purchase of major equipment (such as solid waste collection  trucks, telecommunication equipment, necessary maintenance equipment,  fire service equipment, X-ray machines) which will in themselves provide  an essential service to rural residents; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The purchase of existing facilities when it is necessary either  to improve or to prevent a loss of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construct or relocate public buildings, roads, bridges, fences,  or utilities and to make other public improvements necessary to the  successful operation or protection of facilities authorized in paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relocate private buildings, roads, bridges, fences, or  utilities, and other private improvements necessary to the successful  operation or protection of facilities authorized in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pay the following expenses, but only when such expenses are a  necessary part of a project to finance facilities authorized in  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable fees and costs such as legal, engineering,  architectural, fiscal   advisory, recording, environmental impact analyses, archeological  surveys and possible salvage or other mitigation measures, planning,  establishing or acquiring rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs of acquiring interest in land; rights, such as water  rights, leases, permits, and rights-of-way; and other evidence of land  or water control necessary for development of the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purchasing or renting equipment necessary to install, maintain,  extend, protect, operate, or utilize facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obligations for construction incurred before grant approval.  Construction work should not be started and obligations for such work or  materials should not be incurred before the grant is approved. However,  if there are compelling reasons for proceeding with construction before  grant approval, applicants may request Agency approval to pay such  obligations. Such requests may be approved if the Agency determines  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before grant  approval;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The obligations will be incurred for authorized grant purposes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contract documents have been approved by the Agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All environmental requirements applicable to the Agency and the  applicant have been met; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The applicant has the legal authority to incur the obligations  at the time proposed, and payment of the debts will remove any basis for  any mechanic's, material, or other liens that may attach to the security  property.  The Agency may authorize payment of such obligations at the time of  grant closing. The Agency's authorization to pay such obligations,  however, is on the condition that it is not committed to make the grant;  it assumes no responsibility for any obligations incurred by the  applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all grant approval  requirements. The applicant's request and the Agency's authorization for  paying such obligations shall be in writing.</p>
