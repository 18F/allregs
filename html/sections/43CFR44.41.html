The payment to qualified units of general local government will be the lesser of the two.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department disburses payments annually for a period of 5 years beginning in the year immediately following the year of Federal acquisition of the land or interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The difference, if any, between the amounts actually paid during each of the 5 years and 1 percent of the fair market value will be deferred to future years. However, a payment or any portion of a payment not paid because Congress appropriated insufficient monies will not be deferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department will begin annual payment of the deferred amount (calculated the same as in paragraph (a) of this section) starting with the sixth fiscal year following Federal acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department disburses payment of the deferred amount until the total amount deferred during the first 5 years is paid in full.</p><p class="depth3">State and Local Governments' Responsibilities After the Department</p><p class="depth3">Distributes Payments</p>
