                            <p class="depth0">When, in the opinion of the appropriate TTB officer, the interests  of the Government demand it, or in any case where the validity of the  bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason, the principal  will be required to give a new bond. A new bond will be required  immediately in the case of the insolvency of a corporate surety.  Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other  persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, to continue or to liquidate the  business of the principal, will execute and file a new bond or obtain  the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds.  When under the provisions of Sec. 24.157 the surety has filed an  application to be relieved of liability under any bond given under this  part and the principal desires or intends to continue business or  operations to which the bond relates, the principal shall file a valid  superseding bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the  surety's notice. New or superseding bonds will show the current date of  execution and the effective date.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1379, as amended, 1380, as amended,  1394, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5354, 5362, 5551))  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1512-0058)  [T.D.
