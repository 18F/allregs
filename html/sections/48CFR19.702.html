                            <p class="depth0">Any contractor receiving a contract for more than the simplified  acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that small business,  veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small  business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and  women-owned small business concerns will have the maximum practicable  opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with its  efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United States  that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the timely  payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their subcontracts with  small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran- owned small business,   HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned  small business concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, Section 8(d)  of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) imposes the following  requirements regarding subcontracting with small businesses and small  business subcontracting plans:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In negotiated acquisitions, each solicitation of offers to  perform a contract or contract modification, that individually is  expected to exceed $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has  subcontracting possibilities, shall require the apparently successful  offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan. If the apparently  successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable  to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the  contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In sealed bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to  perform a contract or contract modification, that individually is  expected to exceed $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has  subcontracting possibilities, shall require the bidder selected for  award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected bidder fails to  submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by the contracting  officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subcontracting plans (see subparagraphs (a)(1) and (2) above)  are not required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From small business concerns;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For personal services contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For contracts or contract modifications that will be performed  entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For modifications to contracts within the general scope of the  contract that do not contain the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of  Small Business Concerns (or equivalent prior clauses; e.g., contracts  awarded before the enactment of Public Law 95-507).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As stated in 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(8), any contractor or  subcontractor failing to comply in good faith with the requirements of  the subcontracting plan is in material breach of its contract. Further,  15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that a contractor's failure to make a  good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting  plan shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(11)</em>, certain costs incurred by  a mentor firm in providing developmental assistance to a  prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor- Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program, may be credited as if they were  subcontract awards to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm for the purpose of  determining whether the mentor firm attains the applicable goals under  any subcontracting plan entered into with any executive agency. However,  the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement must have been approved by  the Director, Small Business Programs of the cognizant DoD military  department or defense agency, before developmental assistance costs may  be credited against subcontract goals. A list of approved agreements may  be obtained at http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/mentor--protege/.
