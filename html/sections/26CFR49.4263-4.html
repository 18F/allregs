                            <p class="depth0">The tax imposed by section 4261 does not apply to amounts paid for  transportation or for seating or sleeping accommodations furnished under  special tariffs providing for fares of not more than 2.5 cents per mile  applicable to round-trip tickets sold to personnel of the United States  Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including  authorized cadets and midshipmen, traveling in uniform of the United  States at their own expense when on official leave, furlough, or pass. A  person claiming exemption under this section will be required to exhibit  to the agent of the carrier a properly executed certificate to show that  he is traveling on official leave, furlough, or pass, but the submission  of an exemption certificate on Form 731 is not necessary in such case.
