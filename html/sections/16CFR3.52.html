                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Automatic review of cases in which the Commission sought  preliminary relief in federal court; timing. For proceedings with  respect to which the Commission has sought preliminary relief in federal  court under 15 U.S.C. 53(b), the Commission will review the initial  decision without the filing of a notice of appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In such cases, any party may file objections to the initial  decision or order of the Administrative Law Judge by filing its opening  appeal brief, subject to the requirements in paragraph (c), within 20  days of the issuance of the initial decision. Any party may respond to  any objections filed by another party by filing an answering brief,  subject to the requirements of paragraph (d), within 20 days of service  of the opening brief. Any party may file a reply to an answering brief,  subject to the requirements of paragraph (e), within 5 days of service  of the answering brief. Unless the Commission orders that there shall be  no oral argument, it will hold oral argument within 10 days after the  deadline for the filing of any reply briefs. The Commission will issue  its final decision pursuant to Sec. 3.54 within 45 days after oral  argument. If no oral argument is scheduled, the Commission will issue  its final decision pursuant to Sec. 3.54 within 45 days after the  deadline for the filing of any reply briefs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no objections to the initial decision are filed, the  Commission may in its discretion hold oral argument within 10 days after  the deadline for the filing of objection, If no oral argument is  scheduled, the Commission will issue its final decision pursuant to  Sec. 3.54 within 45 days after the deadline for the filing of  objections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review in all other cases; timing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In all cases other than  those subject to paragraph (a), any party may file objections to the  initial decision or order of the Administrative Law Judge by filing a  notice of appeal with the Secretary within 10 days after service of the  initial decision. The notice shall specify the party or parties against  whom the appeal is taken and shall designate the initial decision and  order or part thereof appealed from. If a timely notice of appeal is  filed by a party, any other party may thereafter file a notice of appeal  within 5 days after service of the first notice, or within 10 days after  service of the initial decision, whichever period expires last.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In such cases, any party filing a notice of appeal must perfect  its appeal by filing its opening appeal brief, subject to the  requirements in paragraph (c), within 30 days of the issuance of the  initial decision. Any party may respond to the opening appeal brief by  filing an answering brief, subject to the requirements of paragraph (d),  within 30 days of service of the opening brief. Any party may file a  reply to an answering brief, subject to the requirements of paragraph  (e), within 7 days of service of the answering brief. Unless the  Commission orders that there shall be no oral argument, it will hold  oral argument within 15 days after the deadline for the filing of any  reply briefs. The Commission will issue its final decision pursuant to  Sec. 3.54 within 100 days after oral argument. If no oral   argument is scheduled, the Commission will issue its final decision  pursuant to Sec. 3.54 within 100 days after the deadline for the filing  of any reply briefs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal brief. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The opening appeal brief shall contain, in the  order indicated, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A subject index of the matter in the brief, with page  references, and a table of cases (alphabetically arranged), textbooks,  statutes, and other material cited, with page references thereto;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A concise statement of the case, which includes a statement of  facts relevant to the issues submitted for review, and a summary of the  argument, which must contain a succinct, clear, and accurate statement  of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and which must not  merely repeat the argument headings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A specification of the questions intended to be urged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The argument presenting clearly the points of fact and law  relied upon in support of the position taken on each question, with  specific page references to the record and the legal or other material  relied upon; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A proposed form of order for the Commission's consideration  instead of the order contained in the initial decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The brief shall not, without leave of the Commission, exceed  14,000 words.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Answering brief. The answering brief shall contain a subject  index, with page references, and a table of cases (alphabetically  arranged), textbooks, statutes, and other material cited, with page  references thereto, as well as arguments in response to the appellant's  appeal brief. The answering brief shall not, without leave of the  Commission, exceed 14,000 words.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reply brief. The reply brief shall be limited to rebuttal of  matters in the answering brief and shall not, without leave of the  Commission, exceed 7,000 words. The Commission will not consider new  arguments or matters raised in reply briefs that could have been raised  earlier in the principal briefs. No further briefs may be filed except  by leave of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In camera information. If a party includes in any brief to be  filed under this section information that has been granted in camera  status pursuant to Sec. 3.45(b) or is subject to confidentiality  provisions pursuant to a protective order, the party shall file 2  versions of the brief in accordance with the procedures set forth in  Sec. 3.45(e). The time period specified by this section within which a  party may file an answering or reply brief will begin to run upon  service on the party of the in camera or confidential version of a  brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Signature. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The original of each brief filed shall have a  hand-signed signature by an attorney of record for the party, or in the  case of parties not represented by counsel, by the party itself, or by a  partner if a partnership, or by an officer of the party if it is a  corporation or an unincorporated association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Signing a brief constitutes a representation by the signer that  he or she has read it; that to the best of his or her knowledge,  information, and belief, the statements made in it are true; that it is  not interposed for delay; that it complies with the applicable word  count limitation; and that to the best of his or her knowledge,  information, and belief, it complies with all the other rules in this  part. If a brief is not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the  purpose of this section, it may be stricken as sham and false and the  proceeding may go forward as though the brief has not been filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Oral argument. All oral arguments shall be public unless  otherwise ordered by the Commission. Oral arguments will be held in all  cases on appeal or review to the Commission, unless the Commission  otherwise orders upon its own initiative or upon request of any party  made at the time of filing his or her brief. Oral arguments before the  Commission shall be reported stenographically, unless otherwise ordered,  and a member of the Commission absent from an oral argument may  participate in the consideration and decision of the appeal in any case  in which the oral argument is stenographically reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Corrections in transcript of oral argument. The Commission will  entertain only joint motions of the parties requesting corrections in  the transcript   of oral argument, except that the Commission will receive a unilateral  motion which recites that the parties have made a good faith effort to  stipulate to the desired corrections but have been unable to do so. If  the parties agree in part and disagree in part, they should file a joint  motion incorporating the extent of their agreement, and, if desired,  separate motions requesting those corrections to which they have been  unable to agree. The Secretary, pursuant to delegation of authority by  the Commission, is authorized to prepare and issue in the name of the  Commission a brief ``Order Correcting Transcript'' whenever a joint  motion to correct transcript is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Briefs of amicus curiae. A brief of an amicus curiae may be  filed by leave of the Commission granted on motion with notice to the  parties or at the request of the Commission, except that such leave  shall not be required when the brief is presented by an agency or  officer of the United States; or by a State, territory, commonwealth, or  the District of Columbia, or by an agency or officer of any of them. The  brief may be conditionally filed with the motion for leave. A motion for  leave shall identify the interest of the applicant and state how a  Commission decision in the matter would affect the applicant or persons  it represents. The motion shall also state the reasons why a brief of an  amicus curiae is desirable. Except as otherwise permitted by the  Commission, an amicus curiae shall file its brief within the time  allowed the parties whose position as to affirmance or reversal the  amicus brief will support. The Commission shall grant leave for a later  filing only for cause shown, in which event it shall specify within what  period such brief must be filed. A motion for an amicus curiae to  participate in oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary  reasons. An amicus brief may be no more than one-half the maximum length  authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Word count limitation. The word count limitations in this  section include headings, footnotes and quotations, but do not include  the cover, table of contents, table of citations or authorities,  glossaries, statements with respect to oral argument, any addendums  containing statutes, rules or regulations, any certificates of counsel,  proposed form of order, and any attachment required by Sec. 3.45(e).  Extensions of word count limitations are disfavored, and will only be  granted where a party can make a strong showing that undue prejudice  would result from complying with the existing limit.  [74 FR 1834, Jan. 13, 2009, as amended at 76 FR 52253, Aug. 22, 2011]</p>
