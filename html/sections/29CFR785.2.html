                            <p class="depth0">The ultimate decisions on interpretations of the act are made by the  courts. The Administrator must determine in the first instance the  positions he will take in the enforcement of the Act. The regulations in  this part seek to inform the public of such positions. It should thus  provide a ``practical guide for employers and employees as to how the  office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to  apply it.'' (Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 138 (1944).)</p>
