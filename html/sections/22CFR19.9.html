                                Sec. 19.9  Pension benefits for former spouses.

Sec. 19.9-1  Entitlement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement under Sec. 19.7 or a court order under Sec. 19.6, a person who, after February 15, 1981, becomes a former spouse of a participant (or former participant who separated from the Service after February 15, 1981) and who has not remarried prior to becoming 60 years of age, becomes entitled to a monthly pension benefit effective on a date determined under Sec. 19.9-2 in an amount determined under Sec. 19.9-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A former spouse shall not be qualified for a pension under this subsection if, before the commencement of that pension, the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A pension benefit under this section is treated the same as a survivor annuity for purposes of Sec. 19.11-5(b): a former spouse who elects to receive a pension under this section must waive simultaneous receipt of any survivor annuity.
[46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981]


Sec. 19.9-2  Commencement and termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The pension of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the latter of the day the principal becomes entitled to a Foreign Service annuity or on the first day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. (Suspension or reduction of a Foreign Service annuity because or reemployment does not affect the commencement of a pension to a former spouse.) In the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant, the pension of such former spouse shall commence on the latter of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date the principal would qualify for an annuity (other than a disability annuity) on the basis of his/her creditable service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date the disability annuity begins; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The first of the month in which the divorce becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The pension of a former spouse and the right thereto terminate on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date the annuity of the former participant terminates unless the termination results from recall, reappointment or reinstatement in the Foreign Service or reemployment in Government service.


Sec. 19.9-3  Computation and payment of pension to former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A pension to a former spouse is paid monthly on the same date that annuity is paid to the principal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No spousal agreement or court order may provide for a pension or any combination of pensions to former spouses of any one principal which exceeds the net annuity of the principal as defined in Sec. 19.6-2(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A pension to a former spouse not fixed by a spousal agreement or court order shall equal the former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent of the annuity to which the principal is entitled on the date the divorce becomes final, or, if not then entitled to an annuity, 50 percent of the annuity to which the principal first becomes entitled following that date. A pension to a former spouse of a disability annuitant shall be calculated on the basis of an annuity for which the participant would qualify if not disabled. A pension to a former spouse will be increased by the same percentage of each cost-of-living adjustment received by the principal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Department will initiate payment of a pension to a former spouse after complying with the notification and other procedures described in Sec. 19.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If a pension can not be paid because a former spouse is missing, the principal may file an affidavit with PER/ER/RET that he/she does not know the whereabouts of the former spouse. In such an event, the principal and the Department will follow the procedures in Sec. 19.11-4 in an effort to locate the former spouse. The annuity of the principal will be reduced by the amount of the pension to the former spouse even though the latter is not being paid. If the former spouse has not been located during the 12-month period following the date the principal files an affidavit under this section, the annuity of the principal will be recomputed effective from its commencing date (or on the date following the last month a pension payment was made to the former spouse) and paid without reduction of the amount of pension to the former spouse. If the former spouse subsequently is located, pension payments to him/her will be initiated at that time at the rate that would have been payable had they been paid continuously from the original effective date. The Department shall not be liable to make any pension payments to the former spouse for the missing period if the procedures under this section were faithfully complied with nor will the Department be responsible for recovering any payments made to the principal for the benefit of the former spouse.


Sec. 19.9-4  Effect on annuitant.</p><p class="depth0">Any pension payable to a former spouse under this section or pursuant to any spousal agreement or court order shall be deducted from the annuity of the principal. (See Sec. 19.6-4 concerning retroactive adjustments.) If the annuity of such a principal in any month is discontinued or reduced so that the net amount payable is less than the pension to the former spouse or spouses of the principal because of recall, reappointment or reinstatment in the Foreign Service or reemployment in the Government service, the principal's salary, rather than annuity, shall be reduced by the amount of the pension payment(s). Such salary reductions shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund. If a pension to a former spouse is discontinued for any reason except a suspension pending a determination of entitlement, the annuity of the principal shall be recomputed effective as of the date of discontinuance of the pension, and paid as if the pension to the former spouse had never been deducted.</p>
