These steps shall include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Removing all above ground structures, equipment and roads used for operations, except that such structures, equipment and roads may remain where they are to be used for continuing operations which are the subject of another approved plan of operations or of a plan which has been submitted for approval, or unless otherwise authorized by the Regional Director consistent with the unit purpose and management objectives;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removing all other man-made debris resulting from operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Removing or neutralizing any contaminating substances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Plugging and capping all nonproductive wells and filling dump holes, ditches, reserve pits and other excavations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Grading to reasonably conform the contour of the area of operations to a contour similar to that which existed prior to the initiation of operations, where such grading will not jeopardize reclamation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Replacing the natural topsoil necessary for vegetative restoration; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Reestablishing native vegetative communities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reclamation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is unacceptable unless it provides for the safe movement of native wildlife, the reestablishment of native vegetative communities, the normal flow of surface and reasonable flow of subsurface waters, and the return of the area to a condition which does not jeopardize visitor safety or public use of the unit.</p>
