Except as provided in paragraph (f)  of this section, before using a new brake system technology for the  first time on its system the operating railroad or railroads shall  submit a pre-revenue service acceptance testing plan containing the  information required by paragraph (e) of this section and obtain the  approval of the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety, under the  procedures specified in Sec. 232.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with plan. After receiving FRA approval of the pre- revenue service testing plan and before introducing the new brake system  technology into revenue service, the operating railroad or railroads  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adopt and comply with such FRA-approved plan, including fully  executing the tests required by the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report to the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety the results  of the pre-revenue service acceptance tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Correct any safety deficiencies identified by FRA in the design  of the equipment or in the inspection, testing, and maintenance  procedures or, if safety deficiencies cannot be corrected by design or  procedural changes, agree to comply with any operational limitations  that may be imposed by the Associate Administrator for Safety on the  revenue service operation of the equipment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain FRA approval to place the new brake system technology in  revenue service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance with limitations. The operating railroad shall comply  with each operational limitation, if any, imposed by the Associate  Administrator for Safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Availability of plan. The plan shall be made available to FRA  for inspection and copying upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Elements of plan. The plan shall include all of the following  elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An identification of each waiver, if any, of FRA or other  Federal safety regulations required for the tests or for revenue service  operation of the equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A clear statement of the test objectives. One of the principal  test objectives shall be to demonstrate that the equipment meets the  safety design and performance requirements specified in this part when  operated in the environment in which it is to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A planned schedule for conducting the tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the railroad property or facilities to be used  to conduct the tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A detailed description of how the tests are to be conducted.  This description shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An identification of the equipment to be tested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The method by which the equipment is to be tested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The criteria to be used to evaluate the equipment's  performance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The means by which the test results are to be reported to FRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of any special instrumentation to be used during  the tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A description of the information or data to be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A description of how the information or data obtained is to be  analyzed or used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A description of any criteria to be used as safety limits during  the testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A description of the criteria to be used to measure or  determine the success or failure of the tests. If acceptance is to be  based on extrapolation of less than full level testing results, the   analysis to be done to justify the validity of the extrapolation shall  be described.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A description of any special safety precautions to be observed  during the testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A written set of standard operating procedures to be used to  ensure that the testing is done safely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Quality control procedures to ensure that the inspection,  testing, and maintenance procedures are followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Criteria to be used for the revenue service operation of the  equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> A description of all testing of the equipment that has  previously been performed, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception. For brake system technologies that have previously  been used in revenue service in the United States, the railroad shall  test the equipment on its system, prior to placing it in revenue  service, to ensure the compatibility of the equipment with the operating  system (track, signals, etc.) of the railroad. A description of such  testing shall be retained by the railroad and made available to FRA for  inspection and copying upon request.</p>
