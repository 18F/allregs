                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in order to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, loans may be made for the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard to their geographical location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the greatest extent practical, loans are limited to providing telephone facilities that serve subscribers in rural areas. In order to furnish and improve service to rural subscribers it may at times be necessary to provide loan funds to finance telephone facilities which (1) will also serve nonrural subscribers, or (2) are located in nonrural areas. Loans may be approved to finance such facilities if the Administrator determines, on a case-by-case basis, that (i) the primary purpose of the loan is to provide service to rural areas and (ii) the financing of facilities for nonrural subscribers is necessary and incidental to furnishing or improving telephone service in rural areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan funds may be approved for facilities to serve nonrural subscribers only if (1) the principal purpose of the loan is to furnish and improve rural service and (2) the use of loan funds to serve nonrural subscribers is necessary and incidental to the principal purpose of the loan. The following are examples of purposes for which such loans may be made (such loans are not limited to these examples):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of construction of a new system, if the loan would not be economically feasible and self-liquidating unless the nonrural as well as the rural portions of the telephone service area are included in the proposed system, the loan may include funds for both portions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the acquisition of an existing system located in and serving a nonrural area is necessary to serve as the nucleus of an expanded system to furnish area coverage service in rural areas, the loan may include funds to finance the acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a system is being converted to modern service for rural subscribers, the loan may include funds for the conversion of the nonrural facilities, if the rural service will be improved as a result of such nonrural improvements and it is impractical to finance and serve the nonrural and rural areas separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A loan may include funds to serve nonrural subscribers located in community centers frequently called by the rural subscribers if the construction to serve such nonrural subscribers will be incidental to, and contribute substantially to, the provision of adequate service for the rural subscribers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS may also approve financing for facilities to serve nonrural areas if, at the time financing was first approved by RUS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nonrural area had a population of 1,500 or less when first financed by RUS and that financing was approved prior to November 1, 1993; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nonrural area had a population of 5,000 or less when first financed by RUS and that financing was approved on or after November 1, 1993.
