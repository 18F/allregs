                            <p class="depth0">An inmate may be permitted to correspond with an inmate confined in  any other penal or correctional institution if the other inmate is  either a member of the immediate family, or is a party or witness in a  legal action in which both inmates are involved. Such correspondence may  be approved in other exceptional circumstances, with particular regard  to the security level of the institution, the nature of the relationship  between the two inmates, and whether the inmate has other regular  correspondence. The following additional limitations apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Such correspondence at institutions of all security levels may  always be inspected and read by staff at the sending and receiving  institutions (it may not be sealed by the inmate); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate unit manager at each institution must approve  of the correspondence if both inmates are housed in Federal institutions  and both inmates are members of the same immediate family or are a party  or witness in a legal action in which both inmates are involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Wardens of both institutions must approve of the  correspondence if one of the inmates is housed at a non-Federal  institution or if approval is being granted on the basis of exceptional  circumstances.
