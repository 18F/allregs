The additive consists of not less than 28 percent methyl ester of cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic acid, and not less than 28 percent methyl ester of trans-10, cis-12-octadecadienoic acid with the sum of the other methyl esters of octadecadienoic acid not to exceed 4 percent. The additive shall contain not less than 35 percent of other fatty acid esters composed of

oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, and other associated acid esters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The additive is used or intended for use in the feed of growing and finishing swine as a source of fatty acids at levels not to exceed 0.6% in the finished feed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The additive meets the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Free methyl alcohol not to exceed 0.015%.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insoluble impurities not to exceed 0.1%.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Moisture not to exceed 0.5%.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unsaponifiable matter not to exceed 1.0%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To assure safe use of the additive, in addition to the other information required by the act:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label and labeling of the additive and any feed premix shall bear the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the additive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement to indicate that methyl esters of conjugated linoleic acid (cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic acids) must not be added to vitamin or mineral premixes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label and labeling of the additive, any feed premix, or complete feed prepared therefrom shall bear adequate directions for use.
