                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must remove all platforms and other facilities within 1 year  after the lease or pipeline right-of-way terminates, unless you receive  approval to maintain the structure to conduct other activities.  Platforms include production platforms, well jackets, single-well  caissons, and pipeline accessory platforms. Other activities include  those supporting OCS oil and gas production and transportation, as well  as other energy-related or marine-related uses (including LNG) for which  adequate financial assurance for decommissioning has been provided to a  Federal agency which has given BSEE a commitment that it has and will  exercise authority to compel the performance of decommissioning within a  time following cessation of the new use acceptable to BSEE. The approval  will specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether you must continue to maintain any financial assurance  for decommissioning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether, and under what circumstances, you must perform any  decommissioning not performed by the new facility owner/user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before you may remove a platform or other facility, you must  submit a final removal application to the Regional Supervisor for  approval and   include the information listed in Sec.  250.1727.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must remove a platform or other facility according to the  approved application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must flush all production risers with seawater before you  remove them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must notify the Regional Supervisor at least 48 hours before  you begin the removal operations.</p>
