                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A threshold quantity of a regulated substance listed in Sec. 68.130 is present at a stationary source if the total quantity of the regulated substance contained in a process exceeds the threshold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of determining whether more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance is present at the stationary source, the following exemptions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Concentrations of a regulated toxic substance in a mixture. If a regulated substance is present in a mixture and the concentration of the substance is below one percent by weight of the

mixture, the amount of the substance in the mixture need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source. Except for oleum, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer), if the concentration of the regulated substance in the mixture is one percent or greater by weight, but the owner or operator can demonstrate that the partial pressure of the regulated substance in the mixture (solution) under handling or storage conditions in any portion of the process is less than 10 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), the amount of the substance in the mixture in that portion of the process need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source. The owner or operator shall document this partial pressure measurement or estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Concentrations of a regulated flammable substance in a mixture. (i) General provision. If a regulated substance is present in a mixture and the concentration of the substance is below one percent by weight of the mixture, the mixture need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity of the regulated substance is present at the stationary source. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, if the concentration of the substance is one percent or greater by weight of the mixture, then, for purposes of determining whether a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source, the entire weight of the mixture shall be treated as the regulated substance unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Association flammability hazard rating of 4. The demonstration shall be in accordance with the definition of flammability hazard rating 4 in the NFPA 704, Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response, National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA, 1996. Available from the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269-9101.

Regulated substances in gasoline, when in distribution or related storage for use as fuel for internal combustion engines, need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at a stationary source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures. Prior to entry into a natural gas processing plant or a petroleum refining process unit, regulated substances in naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at a stationary source. Naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures include any combination of the following: condensate, crude oil, field gas, and produced

water, each as defined in Sec. 68.3 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Articles. Regulated substances contained in articles need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Uses.

If a regulated substance is manufactured, processed, or used in a laboratory at a stationary source under the supervision of a technically qualified individual as defined in Sec. 720.3(ee) of this chapter, the quantity of the substance need not be considered in determining whether a threshold quantity is present. This exemption does not apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specialty chemical production;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacture, processing, or use of substances in pilot plant scale operations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Activities conducted outside the laboratory.
