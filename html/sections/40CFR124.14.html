When the public comment period is reopened under  this paragraph, all persons, including applicants, who believe any  condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Regional  Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a  permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all  reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position,  including all supporting material, by a date, not less than sixty days  after public notice under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, set by the  Regional Administrator. Thereafter, any person may file a written  response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less  than twenty days after the date set for filing of the material, set by  the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph shall  identify the issues to which the requirements of Sec. 124.14(a) shall  apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On his own motion or on the request of any person, the Regional  Administrator may direct that the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of  this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it  reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and  that applying the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will  substantially expedite the decisionmaking process. The notice of the  draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A comment period of longer than 60 days will often be necessary  in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity  to comply with the requirements of this section. Commenters may request  longer comment periods and they shall be granted under Sec. 124.10 to  the extent they appear necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any data information or arguments submitted during the public  comment period, including information or arguments required under Sec.  124.13, appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a permit,  the Regional Administrator may take one or more of the following  actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified, under Sec.  124.6;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepare a revised statement of basis under Sec. 124.7, a fact  sheet or revised fact sheet under Sec. 124.8 and reopen the comment  period under Sec. 124.14; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reopen or extend the comment period under Sec. 124.10 to give  interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or  arguments submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be  limited to the substantial new questions that caused its reopening. The  public notice under Sec. 124.10 shall define the scope of the  reopening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under  Sec. 124.10.
