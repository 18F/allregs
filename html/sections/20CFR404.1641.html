                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The performance standards include both a target level of performance and a threshold level of performance for the State agency. The target level represents a level of performance that we and the States will work to attain in the future. The threshold level is the minimum acceptable level of performance. Performance below the threshold level will be the basis for the Commissioner's taking from the State agency partial or complete responsibility for performing the disability determination function. Intermediate State agency goals are designed to help each State agency move from its current performance levels to the target levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The target level. The target level is the optimum level of performance. There are three targets--one for combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy, one for title II initial processing time, and one for title XVI initial processing time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The threshold level. The threshold level is the minimum acceptable level of performance. There are three thresholds--one for combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy, one for title II initial processing time, and one for title XVI initial processing time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Intermediate goals. Intermediate goals are levels of performance between the threshold levels and the target levels established by our appropriate Regional Commissioner after negotiation with each State agency. The intermediate goals are designed to help the State agencies reach the target levels. Failure to meet these goals is not a cause for considering the State agency to be substantially failing to comply with the performance standards. However, failure to meet the intermediate goals may result in consultation and an offer of optional performance support depending on the availability of our resources.
