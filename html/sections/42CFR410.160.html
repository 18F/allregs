Application of the Part B annual deductible to rural health clinic services is in accordance with Sec. 405.2425(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amount of the Part B annual deductible. (1) Beginning with expenses for services furnished during calendar year 2006, and for all succeeding years, the annual deductible is the previous year's deductible plus the annual percentage increase in the monthly actuarial rate for Medicare enrollees age 65 and over, rounded to the nearest dollar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beginning with expenses for services furnished during calendar year 2006, and for all succeeding years, the annual deductible is the previous year's deductible plus the annual percentage increase in the monthly actuarial rate for Medicare enrollees age 65 and over, rounded to the nearest dollar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For 2005, the deductible is $110.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From 1991 through 2004, the deductible was $100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From 1982 through 1990, the deductible was $75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From 1973 through 1981, the deductible was $60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From 1966 through 1972, the deductible was $50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Carryover of Part B annual deductible. For calendar years before 1982, the Part B annual deductible was reduced by the amount of expenses incurred during the last quarter of the preceding year that was applied to meet the deductible for that preceding year. Example: If $20 of expenses incurred in November 1980 was used to meet the 1980 deductible, the 1981 deductible was reduced to $40 ($60-$20).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Examples of application of the annual deductible. (1) Mr. A submitted claims for the following expenses incurred during 1982: $20 for services furnished in March by physician X; $30 for services furnished in April by physician Y; $50 for services furnished in June by physician Z, for a total of $100. The carrier determined that the charges as submitted were the reasonable charges. The first $75 of expenses for which claims were processed is applied to meet the $75 deductible for that year. Medicare Part B pays 80 percent of the remaining $25, or $20.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mr. A submitted claims for the following expenses incurred during 1982: $20 for services furnished in March by physician X; $30 for services furnished in April by physician Y; $50 for services furnished in June by physician Z, for a total of $100. The carrier determined that the charges as submitted were the reasonable charges. The first $75 of expenses for which claims were processed is applied to meet the $75 deductible for that year. Medicare Part B pays 80 percent of the remaining $25, or $20.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mr. B submitted a claim that included a $25 charge by a doctor for an examination to prescribe a hearing aid and an $80 charge for office surgery. This was the first claim relating to Mr. B's medical expenses processed in the calendar year. The carrier disallowed the $25 charge because the type of examination is not covered by Medicare. The carrier reduced the $80 surgery charge to a reasonable charge of $40. Only the $40 reasonable charge for covered services will count toward meeting Mr. B's deductible. Since the remainder of the surgery charge constitutes and excess over the reasonable charge, it cannot be applied to satisfy Mr. B's deductible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mr. C became entitled to Medicare Part B benefits on July 1, 1982. He incurred expenses of $200 in July, August, and September. The carrier determined that the changes as submitted were reasonable. Even though Mr. C was entitled to benefits for only half the year, he must meet the full $75 deductible. Thus, $75 of this expense constitutes Mr. C's deductible. Medicare would pay $100, which is 80 percent of the remaining $125.
