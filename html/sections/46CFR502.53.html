No replies  to the written submissions will be allowed unless, because of the nature  of the proceeding, the Commission indicates that replies would be  necessary or desirable for the formulation of a just and reasonable  rule, except that, where the proposed rules are such as are required by  statute to be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing, such  hearing shall be conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557, and the  procedure shall be the same as stated in subpart J of this part. In the  event that replies or succeeding rounds of comments are permitted,  copies shall be served on all prior participants in the proceeding. A  list of participants may be obtained from the Secretary of the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In those rulemaking proceedings in which respondents are named,  interested persons who wish to participate shall file a petition to  intervene in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 502.72 [Rule 53.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a formal hearing is held in a rulemaking proceeding,  interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to participate  through submission of relevant, material, reliable, and probative  written evidence properly verified, except that such evidence submitted  by persons not present at the hearing will not be made a part of the  record if objected to by any party on the ground that the person who  submits the evidence is not present for cross-examination.
