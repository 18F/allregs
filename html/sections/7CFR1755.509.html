                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Customer access location installations at mobile homes shall be treated the same whether the homes are mounted on permanent foundations or temporary foundations and shall be installed as specified in Sec. Sec. 1755.500 through 1755.510. For the purpose of this section, mobile homes include manufactured homes, motor homes, truck campers, travel trailers, and all forms of recreational vehicles. Customer access location installations at mobile homes can be considerably different than customer access location installations at regular homes and borrowers shall be certain that the two types of installations are properly applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The method of customer access location installation prescribed by the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg] for a mobile home depends on how the electric power is installed at the mobile home and it can involve considerable judgment on the part of the telecommunications installer. The National Electrical Code [supreg] and NEC [supreg] are registered trademarks of the National Fire Protection Association, Inc., Quincy, MA 02269. The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from NFPA, 1 Batterymarch Park, P. O. Box 9101, Quincy, Massachusetts 02269-9101, telephone number 1 (800) 344-3555. Copies of ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], are available for inspection during normal business hours at RUS, room 2905, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., STOP 1598, Washington, DC 20250-1598, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], requires primary station protectors to be located where specific acceptable grounding electrodes exist. The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], allows station protector installations to be at the location of the power meter or the electric disconnecting means apparatus serving the mobile home providing these electric facilities are installed in the manner specifically defined by the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg]. The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], requires the station protectors to be installed at the nearest of a number of other meticulously defined ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, NEC [supreg], acceptable electrodes where the protector cannot be installed at the power meter or the electric disconnecting means apparatus serving the mobile home. The provisions can be confusing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NIDs shall be installed at mobile homes as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the mobile home electric service equipment (power meter, etc.,) or the electric service disconnecting means associated with the mobile home is located within 35 ft (10.7 m) of the exterior wall of the mobile homes it serves, the NID shall be installed in accordance with Figure 17 as follows:

Figures 19 and 20 are as follows:
