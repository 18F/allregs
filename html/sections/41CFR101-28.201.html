Available storage services of executive agencies shall be made available for cross-servicing the requirements of other Federal agencies when requested. Other Federal agencies are encouraged to participate in cross-servicing arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this subpart 101-28.2 do not apply to ocean terminals, Government storage activities financed under industrial funds, activities concerned with the storage and handling of bulk fuels (petroleum products), and
