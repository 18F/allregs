                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In contracts involving cosponsored research and development that  require the contractor to make substantial contributions of funds or  resources (e.g., by cost-sharing or by repayment of nonrecurring costs),  and the contractor's and the Government's respective contributions to  any item, component, process, or computer software, developed or  produced under the contract are not readily segregable, the contracting  officer may limit the acquisition of, or acquire less than unlimited  rights to, any data developed and delivered under the contract. Agencies  may regulate the use of this authority in their supplements. Lesser  rights shall, at a minimum, assure use of the data for agreed-to  Governmental purposes (including reprocurement rights as appropriate),  and address any disclosure limitations or restrictions to be imposed on  the data. Also, consideration may be given to requiring the contractor  to directly license others if needed to carry out the objectives of the  contract. Since the purpose of the cosponsored research and development,  the legitimate proprietary interests of the contractor, the needs of the  Government, and the respective contributions of both parties may vary,  no specific clauses are prescribed, but a clause providing less than  unlimited rights in the Government for data developed and delivered  under the contract (such as license rights) may be tailored to the  circumstances consistent with the foregoing and the policy set forth in  27.402. As a guide, a clause may be appropriate when the contractor  contributes money or resources, or agrees to make repayment of  nonrecurring costs, of a value of approximately 50 percent of the total  cost of the contract (i.e., Government, contractor, and/or third party  paid costs), and the respective contributions are not readily segregable  for any work element to be performed under the contract. A clause may be  used for all or for only specifically identified tasks or work elements  under the contract. In the latter instance, its use will be in addition  to whatever other data rights clause is prescribed under this subpart,  with the contract specifically identifying which clause is to apply to  which tasks or work elements. Further, this type of clause may not be  appropriate where the purpose of the contract is to produce data for  dissemination to the public, or to develop or demonstrate technologies  that will be available, in any event, to the public for its direct use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the contractor's contributions are readily segregable (by  performance requirements and the funding for the contract) and so  identified in the contract, any resulting data may be treated under this  clause as limited rights data or restricted computer software in  accordance with 27.404-2(c) or (d), as applicable; or if this treatment  is inconsistent with the purpose of the contract, rights to the data  may, if so negotiated and stated in the contract, be treated in a manner  consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
