                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who may petition. Any person may petition the Agency to amend existing listing decisions under the SNAP program, or to add a new substance to any of the SNAP lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Types of petitions. Five types of petitions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program to the acceptable list. This type of petition is comparable to the 90-day notifications, except that it would generally be initiated by entities other than the companies that manufacture, formulate, or otherwise use the substitute. Companies that manufacture, formulate, or use substitutes that want to have their substitutes added to the acceptable list should submit information on the substitute under the 90-day review program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program to the unacceptable list;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and add it to the unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the unacceptable and add it to the acceptable list;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability listing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Petitions to grandfather use of a substitute listed as unacceptable or acceptable subject to use restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Content of the petition. The Agency requires that the petitioner submit information on the type of action requested and the rationale for the petition. Petitions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section must contain the information described in Sec. 82.178, which lists the items to be submitted in a 90-day notification. For petitions that request the re-examination of a substitute previously reviewed under the SNAP program, the submitter must also reference the prior submittal or existing listing. Petitions to grandfather use of an unacceptable substitute must describe the applicability of the test to judge the appropriateness of Agency grandfathering as established by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (see Sierra Club v. EPA, 719 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). This test includes whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from previously established practice, the extent to which a party relied on the previous rule, the degree of burden which application of the new rule would impose on the party, and the statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Petition process. (1) Notification of affected companies. If the petition concerns a substitute previously either approved or restricted under the SNAP program, the Agency will contact the original submitter of that substitute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notification of affected companies. If the petition concerns a substitute previously either approved or restricted under the SNAP program, the Agency will contact the original submitter of that substitute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review for data adequacy. The Agency will review the petition for adequacy of data. As with a 90-day notice, the Agency may suspend review until the petitioner submits the information necessary to evaluate the petition. To reach a timely decision on substitutes, EPA may use collection authorities such as those contained in section 114 of the Clean Air Act as amended, as well as information collection provisions of other environmental statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Review procedures. To evaluate the petition, the Agency may submit the petition for review to appropriate experts inside and outside the Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Timing of determinations. If data are adequate, as described in Sec. 82.180, the Agency will respond to the petition within 90 days of receiving a complete petition. If the petition is inadequately supported, the Agency will query the petitioner to fill any data gaps before the 90-day review period begins, or may deny the petition because data are inadequate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rulemaking procedures. EPA will initiate rulemaking whenever EPA grants a petition to add a substance to the list of unacceptable substitutes, remove a substance from any list, or change or create an acceptable listing by imposing or deleting use conditions or use limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Communication of decision. The Agency will inform petitioners within 90 days of receiving a complete petition whether their request has been granted or denied. If a petition is denied, the Agency will publish in the Federal Register an explanation of the determination. If a petition is granted, the Agency will publish the revised SNAP list incorporating the final petition decision within 6 months of reaching a determination or in the next scheduled update, if sooner, provided any required rulemaking has been completed within the shorter period.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings that is unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male or female, as appropriate) must be used with all containers of the refrigerant, on can taps, on recovery, recycling, and charging equipment, and on all air conditioning system service ports. These fittings must be designed to mechanically prevent cross-charging with another refrigerant. A refrigerant may only be used with the fittings and can taps specifically intended for that refrigerant. Using an adapter or deliberately modifying a fitting to use a different refrigerant will be a violation of this use condition. In addition, fittings shall meet the following criteria, derived from Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and recommended practices:</p><p class="depth0">a. When existing CFC-12 service ports are to be retrofitted, conversion assemblies shall attach to the CFC-12 fitting with a thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner that permanently prevents the assembly from being removed.</p><p class="depth0">b. All conversion assemblies and new service ports must satisfy the vibration testing requirements of sections 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of SAE J1660, as applicable, excluding references to SAE J639 and SAE J2064, which are specific to HFC-134a.</p><p class="depth0">c. In order to prevent discharge of refrigerant to the atmosphere, systems shall have a device to limit compressor operation before the pressure relief device will vent refrigerant. This requirement is waived for systems that do not feature such a pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth0">d. All CFC-12 service ports not retrofitted with conversion assemblies shall be rendered permanently incompatible for use with CFC-12 related service equipment by fitting with a device attached with a thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner that prevents the device from being removed.</p><p class="depth0">2. When a retrofit is performed, a label must be used as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. The person conducting the retrofit must apply a label to the air conditioning system in the engine compartment that contains the following information:</p><p class="depth0">i. The name and address of the technician and the company performing the retrofit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The date of the retrofit.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The trade name, charge amount, and, when applicable, the ASHRAE refrigerant numerical designation of the refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The type, manufacturer, and amount of lubricant used.</p><p class="depth0">v. If the refrigerant is or contains an ozone-depleting substance, the phrase ``ozone depleter.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. If the refrigerant displays flammability limits as measured according to ASTM E681, the statement ``This refrigerant is FLAMMABLE. Take appropriate precautions.''</p><p class="depth0">b. This label must be large enough to be easily read and must be permanent.</p><p class="depth0">c. The background color must be unique to the refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">d. The label must be affixed to the system over information related to the previous refrigerant, in a location not normally replaced during vehicle repair.</p><p class="depth0">e. Information on the previous refrigerant that cannot be covered by the new label must be permanently rendered unreadable.</p><p class="depth0">3. No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant must be recovered in accordance with regulations issued under section 609 of the CAA prior to charging with a substitute.</p><p class="depth0">Solvent Cleaning Sector--Proposed Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions Substitutes----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Application                 Substitute           Decision          Conditions           Comments----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Metals Cleaning with CFC-113,     Monochlorotoluenes   Acceptable.......

This appendix contains information collection and recordkeeping requirements which will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Under section 612 of the

Clean Air Act, substitutes for which submissions are incomplete may not be sold or used, regardless of other acceptability determinations, and the prohibition against sale of a new refrigerant will not end until 90 days after EPA determines the submission is complete.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the use of a) R-406A/``GHG''/``McCool'', ``GHG-HP'', ``GHG-X4/``Autofrost''/``Chill-It'', ``Hot Shot''/``Kar Kool'', and ``FREEZE 12'' as CFC-12 substitutes in MVACs, and b) all refrigerants submitted for, and listed in, subsequent Notices of Acceptability as substitutes for CFC-12 in MVACs, must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">1. Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings that is unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male or female, as appropriate) must be designed by the manufacturer of the refrigerant. The manufacturer is responsible to ensure that the fittings meet all of the requirements listed below, including testing according to SAE standards. These fittings must be designed to mechanically prevent cross-charging with another refrigerant, including CFC-12.</p><p class="depth0">The fittings must be used on all containers of the refrigerant, on can taps, on recovery, recycling, and charging equipment, and on all air conditioning system service ports. A refrigerant may only be used with the fittings and can taps specifically intended for that refrigerant and designed by the manufacturer of the refrigerant. Using a refrigerant with a fitting designed by anyone else, even if it is different from fittings used with other refrigerants, is a violation of this use condition. Using an adapter or deliberately modifying a fitting to use a different refrigerant is a violation of this use condition.</p><p class="depth0">Fittings shall meet the following criteria, derived from Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and recommended practices:</p><p class="depth0">a. When existing CFC-12 service ports are retrofitted, conversion assemblies shall attach to the CFC-12 fitting with a thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner that permanently prevents the assembly from being removed.</p><p class="depth0">b. All conversion assemblies and new service ports must satisfy the vibration testing requirements of section 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of SAE J1660, as applicable, excluding references to SAE J639 and SAE J2064, which are specific to HFC-134a.</p><p class="depth0">c. In order to prevent discharge of refrigerant to the atmosphere, systems shall have a device to limit compressor operation before the pressure relief device will vent refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">d. All CFC-12 service ports not retrofitted with conversion assemblies shall be rendered permanently incompatible for use with CFC-12 related service equipment by fitting with a device attached with a thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner that prevents the device from being removed.</p><p class="depth0">2. When a retrofit is performed, a label must be used as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. The person conducting the retrofit must apply a label to the air conditioning system in the engine compartment that contains the following information:</p><p class="depth0">i. The name and address of the technician and the company performing the retrofit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The date of the retrofit.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The trade name, charge amount, and, when applicable, the ASHRAE refrigerant numerical designation of the refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The type, manufacturer, and amount of lubricant used.</p><p class="depth0">v. If the refrigerant is or contains an ozone-depleting substance, the phrase ``ozone depleter''.</p><p class="depth0">vi. If the refrigerant displays flammability limits as measured according to ASTM E681, the statement ``This refrigerant is FLAMMABLE. Take appropriate precautions.''</p><p class="depth0">b. The label must be large enough to be easily read and must be permanent.</p><p class="depth0">c. The background color must be unique to the refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">d. The label must be affixed to the system over information related to the previous refrigerant, in a location not normally replaced during vehicle repair.</p><p class="depth0">e. In accordance with SAE J639, testing of labels must meet ANSI/UL 969-1991.</p><p class="depth0">f. Information on the previous refrigerant that cannot be covered by the new label must be rendered permanently unreadable.</p><p class="depth0">3. No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant must be recovered in accordance with regulations issued under section 609 of the CAA prior to charging with a substitute.</p><p class="depth0">Solvent Cleaning Sector</p><p class="depth0">[Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions Substitutes]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Application                 Substitute           Decision            Conditions           Comments----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Electronics Cleaning w/CFC-113     HFC-4310mee.......
