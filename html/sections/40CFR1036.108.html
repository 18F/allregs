                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section contains standards and other regulations applicable to the emission of the air pollutant defined as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perflurocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. This section describes the applicable CO2, N2O, and CH4 standards for engines. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, these standards do not apply for engines used in vehicles subject to (or voluntarily certified to) the CO2, N2O, and CH4 standards for vehicles specified in 40 CFR 1037.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emission standards. Emission standards apply for engines measured using the test procedures specified in subpart F of this part as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CO2 emission standards apply as specified in this paragraph (a)(1). The applicable test cycle for measuring CO2 emissions differs depending on the engine family's primary intended service class and the extent to which the engines will be (or were designed to be) used in tractors. For medium and heavy heavy-duty engines certified as tractor engines, measure CO2 emissions using the steady-state duty cycle specified in 40 CFR 86.1362 (referred to as the SET cycle). This is intended for engines designed to be used primarily in tractors and other line-haul applications. Note that the use of some SET-certified tractor engines in vocational applications does not affect your certification obligation under this paragraph (a)(1); see other provisions of this part and 40 CFR part 1037 for limits on using engines certified to only one cycle. For medium and heavy heavy-duty engines certified as both tractor and vocational engines, measure CO2 emissions using the steady-state duty cycle and the transient duty cycle (sometimes referred to as the FTP engine cycle), both of which are specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This is intended for engines that are designed for use in both tractor and vocational applications. For all other engines (including all spark-ignition engines), measure CO2 emissions using the transient duty cycle specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The CO2 standard for model year 2016 and later spark-ignition engines is 627 g/hp-hr.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following CO2 standards apply for compression-ignition engines and all other engines (in g/hp-hr):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Medium                    Medium</p><p class="depth4">Light heavy- heavy-duty-- Heavy heavy- heavy-duty-- Heavy heavy-</p><p class="depth4">Model years                        duty      vocational     duty--       tractor      duty--</p><p class="depth4">vocational                 tractor----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2014-2016......................................          600          600          567          502          4752017 and later.................................          576          576          555          487          460----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CH4 emission standard is 0.10 g/hp-hr when measured over the transient duty cycle specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This standard begins in model year 2014 for compression ignition engines and in model year 2016 for spark-ignition engines. Note that this standard applies for all fuel types just as the other standards of this section do.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The N2O emission standard for all model year 2014 and later engines is 0.10 g/hp-hr when measured over the transient duty cycle specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This standard

begins in model year 2014 for compression ignition engines and in model year 2016 for spark-ignition engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This paragraph (a)(4) describes alternate emission standards for engines certified under 40 CFR 1037.150(m). The standards of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section do not apply for these engines. The standards in this paragraph (a)(4) apply for emissions measured with the engine installed in a complete vehicle consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1037.150(m)(6). The CO2 standard for the engines equals the test result specified in 40 CFR 1037.150(m)(6) multiplied by 1.10 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 g/mile. The N2O and CH4 standards are both 0.05 g/mile (or any alternate standards that apply to the corresponding vehicle test group). The only requirements of this part that apply to these engines are those in this paragraph (a)(4) and those in Sec. Sec.  1036.115 through 1036.135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Family certification levels. You must specify a CO2 Family Certification Level (FCL) for each engine family. The FCL may not be less than the certified emission level for the engine family. The CO2 Family Emission Limit (FEL) for the engine family is equal to the FCL multiplied by 1.03.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Averaging, banking, and trading. You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with CO2 emission standards. Credits (positive and negative) are calculated from the difference between the FCL and the applicable emission standard. As described in Sec.  1036.705, you may use CO2 credits to certify your engine families to FELs for N2O and/or CH4, instead of the N2O/CH4 standards of this section that otherwise apply. Except as specified in Sec. Sec.  1036.150 and 1036.705, you may not generate or use credits for N2O or CH4 emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Useful life. Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section throughout their full useful life, expressed in service miles or calendar years, whichever comes first. The useful life values applicable to the criteria pollutant standards of 40 CFR part 86 apply for the standards of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicability for testing. The emission standards in this subpart apply as specified in this paragraph (e) to all duty-cycle testing (according to the applicable test cycles) of testable configurations, including certification, selective enforcement audits, and in-use testing. The CO2 FCLs serve as the CO2 emission standards for the engine family with respect to certification and confirmatory testing instead of the standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The FELs serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all other testing. See Sec. Sec.  1036.235 and 1036.241 to determine which engine configurations within the engine family are subject to testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multi-fuel engines. For dual-fuel, multi-fuel, and flexible-fuel engines, perform exhaust testing on each fuel type (for example, gasoline and E85).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (f)(1) applies where you demonstrate the relative amount of each fuel type that your engines consume in actual use. Based on your demonstration, we will specify a weighting factor and allow you to submit the weighted average of your emission results. For example, if you certify an E85 flexible-fuel engine and we determine the engine will produce one-half of its work from E85 and one-half of its work from gasoline, you may average your E85 and gasoline emission results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you certify your engine family to N2O and/or CH4 FELs the FELs apply for testing on all fuel types for which your engine is designed, to the same extent as criteria emission standards apply.</p>
