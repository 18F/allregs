If an institution has no claim on an  asset it has sold, then the retention of any credit risk is recourse. A  recourse obligation typically arises when an institution transfers  assets in a sale and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase assets  or to absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or  interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying  obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if an  institution provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual  obligation to support assets it has sold.

However,  clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance  and that are exercisable at the option of the institution are not  recourse arrangements.</p><p class="depth0">Residual interest--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The term residual interest means any on-balance sheet asset  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created  by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles) of financial assets, whether through a  securitization or otherwise; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Exposes an institution to credit risk directly or indirectly  associated with the transferred asset that exceeds a pro rata share of  the institution's claim on the asset, whether through subordination  provisions or other credit enhancement techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Residual interests generally include credit-enhancing interest- only strips, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained  subordinated interests (and other forms of overcollateralization), and  similar assets that function as a credit enhancement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Residual interests further include those exposures that, in  substance, cause the institution to retain the credit risk of an asset  or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was  sold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Residual interests generally do not include interests purchased  from a third party.

Securitization includes transactions   that create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is  dependent upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans  and commitments.</p><p class="depth0">Servicer cash advance means funds that a mortgage servicer advances  to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to  cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely  collection of the loan. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse  obligation or a direct credit substitute if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is  not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying  asset pool; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make  nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant  amount of the outstanding principal amount on that loan.</p><p class="depth0">Stock means stock and participation certificates.</p><p class="depth0">Term preferred stock means preferred stock with an original maturity  of at least 5 years and on which, if cumulative, the board of directors  has the option to defer dividends, provided that, at the beginning of  each of the last 5 years of the term of the stock, the amount that is  eligible to be counted as permanent capital is reduced by 20 percent of  the original amount of the stock (net of redemptions).</p><p class="depth0">Total capital means assets minus liabilities, valued in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, except that liabilities  do not include obligations to retire stock protected under section 4.9A  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Traded position means a position retained, assumed, or issued that  is externally rated, where there is a reasonable expectation that, in  the near future, the rating will be relied upon by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Unaffiliated investors to purchase the position; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An unaffiliated third party to enter into a transaction  involving the position, such as a purchase, loan, or repurchase  agreement.</p><p class="depth2">U.S. depository institution means branches (foreign and domestic) of  federally insured banks and depository institutions chartered and  headquartered in the 50 states of the United States, the District of  Columbia, Puerto Rico, and United States territories and possessions.  The definition encompasses banks, mutual or stock savings banks, savings  or building and loan associations, cooperative banks, credit unions,  international banking facilities of domestic depository institutions,  and U.S.-chartered depository institutions owned by foreigners.
