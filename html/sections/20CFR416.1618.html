                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. We will consider you to be permanently residing in the  United States under color of law and you may be eligible for SSI  benefits if you are an alien residing in the United States with the  knowledge and permission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service  and that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure. The  Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing  your departure if it is the policy or practice of that agency not to  enforce the departure of aliens in the same category or if from all the  facts and circumstances in your case it appears   that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is otherwise permitting  you to reside in the United States indefinitely. We make these decisions  by verifying your status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service  following the rules contained in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(17)</em> of this section. None  of the categories allows SSI eligibility for nonimmigrants; for example,  students or visitors. Also listed are the most common documents that the  Immigration and Naturalization Service provides to aliens in these  categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aliens admitted to the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C.  1153(a)(7), (section 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).

For Cuban/Haitian Entrants, we ask for  INS Form I-94 stamped ``Cuban/Haitian Entrant (Status Pending)  reviewable January 15, 1981. Employment authorized until January 15,  1981.'' (Although the forms bear this notation, Cuban/Haitian Entrants  are admitted under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality  Act.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aliens residing in the United States pursuant to an indefinite  stay of deportation. We ask for an Immigration and Naturalization  Service letter with this information or INS Form I-94 with such a  notation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Aliens residing in the United States pursuant to an indefinite  voluntary departure. We ask for an Immigration and Naturalization  Service letter or INS Form I-94 showing that a voluntary departure has  been granted for an indefinite time period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Aliens on whose behalf an immediate relative petition has been  approved and their families covered by the petition, who are entitled to  voluntary departure (under 8 CFR 242.5(a)(2)(vi)) and whose departure  the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate  enforcing.

We ask for INS Form I-181 or a passport properly  endorsed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Aliens granted stays of deportation by court order, statute or  regulation, or by individual determination of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service pursuant to section 106 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1105a) or relevant Immigration and  Naturalization Service instructions, whose departure that agency does  not contemplate enforcing. We ask for INS Form I-94 or a letter from the  Immigration and Naturalization Service, or copy of a court order  establishing the alien's status;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Aliens granted asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Immigration  and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158).

You must give us proof that you are in one of the  categories in paragraph (b) of this section. You may give us--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any of the documents listed in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other information which shows that you are in one of the  categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We must contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  We must contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to verify the  information you give us to prove you are permanently residing in the  United States under color of law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3), (4), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (15), or (16) of this  section, we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility  requirements. We will contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service  to verify that the document you give us is currently valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you give us any of the documents listed in paragraphs (b)  (5), (6), (7), (10), or (14) of this section, or documents that indicate  that you meet paragraph (b)(17) of this section, or any other  information to prove you are permanently residing in the United States  under color of law, we will contact the Immigration and Naturalization  Service to verify that the document or other information is currently  valid. We must also get information from the Immigration and  Naturalization Service as to whether that agency contemplates enforcing  your departure. We will apply the following rules:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you have a document that shows that you have an Immigration  and Naturalization Service status that is valid for an indefinite period  we will assume that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not  contemplate enforcing your departure. Therefore, we will pay you  benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements. If, based on  the information we get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service,  we find that your document is currently valid, we will consider this  sufficient proof that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does  not contemplate enforcing your departure. We will continue your  benefits. However, if we find that your document is not currently valid,  we will suspend your benefits under Sec. 416.1320.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you have a document that appears currently valid and shows  you have an Immigration and Naturalization Service status for at least 1  year, or that shows the Immigration and Naturalization Service is  allowing you to remain in the United States for a   specified period due to conditions in your home country, we will assume  that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate  enforcing your departure. Therefore, we will pay you benefits if you  meet all other eligibility requirements. If, based on the information we  get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, we learn that your  document is currently valid and that agency does not contemplate  enforcing your departure, we will continue your benefits. However, if we  learn that your document is not currently valid or that the Immigration  and Naturalization Service does contemplate enforcing your departure, we  will suspend your benefits under Sec. 416.1320.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you have a document that shows you have an Immigration and  Naturalization Service status valid for less than 1 year, or if your  document has no expiration date, or if you have no document, we will not  pay you benefits until the Immigration and Naturalization Service  confirms that your document is currently valid and we get information  from that agency that indicates whether it contemplates enforcing your  departure. If that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure,  we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If at any time after you begin receiving benefits we receive  information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service which  indicates that the Immigration and Naturalization Service contemplates  enforcing your departure, we will suspend your benefits under  Sec. 416.1320 and any benefits you have received after the date that the  Immigration and Naturalization Service began contemplating enforcing  departure will be overpayments under subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What ``United States'' means. We use the term United States in  this section to mean the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the  Northern Mariana Islands.
