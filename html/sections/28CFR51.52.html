                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Surrogate for the court. Section 5 provides for submission of a  voting change to the Attorney General as an alternative to the seeking  of a declaratory judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District  of Columbia. Therefore, the Attorney General shall make the same  determination that would be made by the court in an action for a  declaratory judgment under section 5: whether the submitted change  neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging  the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language  minority group. The burden of proof is on a submitting authority when it  submits a change to the Attorney General for preclearance, as it would  be if the proposed change were the subject of a declaratory judgment  action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. South  Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 328, 335 (1966).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No objection. If the Attorney General determines that the  submitted change neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of  denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or  membership in a language minority group, no objection shall be  interposed to the change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Objection. An objection shall be interposed to a submitted  change if the   Attorney General is unable to determine that the change neither has the  purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to  vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority  group. This includes those situations where the evidence as to the  purpose or effect of the change is conflicting and the Attorney General  is unable to determine that the change is free of both the prohibited  discriminatory purpose and effect.
