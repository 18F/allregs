Pursuant to section 301 of the Act, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 3320 of title 5 of the United States Code, the fact that an applicant is a veteran or disabled veteran, as defined in section 2108 (3A), (3B), or (3C) of such title, shall be considered as an affirmative factor in the selection of candidates for appointment as Foreign Service officer career candidates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Policy.

Successful applicants will be appointed as Career Candidates for a period not to exceed 5 years.

The written examination is designed to enable the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service to test the applicant's intelligence, breadth and quality of knowledge, and understanding in relation to the requirements of Foreign Service work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. Prior to each written examination, the Board of Examiners will establish a closing date for the receipt of applications for designation to take the examination. No person will be designated to take the examination who has not, as of that closing date, filed an application with the Board. To be designated to take the written examination, an applicant, as of the date of the examination, must be a citizen of the United States and at least 20 years of age.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When and where given. The written examination will be given periodically, normally at least once a year, in designated cities in the United States and

at Foreign Service posts, on dates established by the Board of Examiners and publicly announced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Grading. The several parts of the written examination will be weighted and graded according to standards established by the Board of Examiners. The number of candidates who pass each written examination will be governed by the projected hiring needs of the participating foreign affairs departments and agencies in subsequent years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral examination. The following regulations apply to the oral examination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The oral examination is designed to enable the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service to test the candidate's competence to perform the work of a Foreign Service officer at home and abroad, potential for growth in the Foreign Service, and suitability to serve as a representative of the United States abroad. The oral examination for the Junior Career Candidate Program will consist of an assessment procedure publicly announced by the Board of Examiners and hereinafter referred to as the oral examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility--(i) Through written examination.

All eligible candidates normally will be invited to take the oral examination.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Should the total number of eligible candidates substantially exceed the projected hiring needs of the Foreign Service, the Board of Examiners may establish and publicly announce a higher written examination score than the passing level as the basis for selection to take the oral examination.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Board of Examiners may authorize special consideration to be given in the selection of candidates, from among those eligible, for the purpose of meeting language requirements, Affirmative Action goals, or for other purposes which the Board with the concurrence of the prospective hiring agencies may from time to time approve and publicly announce.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The nature and applicability of all criteria utilized to select eligible candidates to take the oral examination will be developed by the Board of Examiners in consultation with the prospective hiring agencies and publicly announced in advance of each examination by the Board.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Candidates who are selected to take the oral examination will be notified of the period of time after the date of the written examination, as determined by the Board of Examiners, within which the oral examination must be conducted. That period will normally be 1 year, but it may be extended or shortened in special circumstances by the Board. The candidacy of anyone whose candidacy has not been extended by the Board, and who has not again passed the written examination in the meantime, will be terminated 2 years after the end of the month in which the written examination was held. Time spent outside the United States and its territories, for reasons acceptable to the Board of Examiners, will not be counted against this 2-year period. The candidacy of anyone for whom the 2-year period is extended by the Board because of being abroad will be terminated automatically if the candidate fails to appear for the oral examination within 3 months after first returning to the United States.

The oral examination cycle will be held each year in Washington, DC, and in selected cities in the United States. If circumstances permit, oral examinations may also be held at selected Foreign Service posts when approved by the Board of Examiners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examining panel. The oral examination will be given by a panel of deputy examiners approved by the Board of Examiners from a roster of Foreign Service officers; Foreign Service information officers; career officers from the Department of State, the United States Information Agency, and the Department of Commerce; and qualified private citizens who, by prior service as members of departmental or agency Foreign Service selection boards or other appropriate activities, have demonstrated special qualifications to serve as deputy examiners.

Candidates who pass the oral examination will be eligible for selection by the Board for the background investigation. The background investigation shall be conducted to determine the candidate's suitability for appointment to the Foreign Service.

nature as to make it unlikely that they would be able to function on a worldwide basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conduct.

Candidates who have completed the examination process; have passed their medical examination, or have obtained a waiver from the Director General of the Foreign Service, or his or her delegatee, or the equivalent in accordance with the procedures of the other participating agencies; and on the basis of their background investigation, have been found suitable to represent the United States abroad, will have their names placed on the functional rank-order register(s), or a special register, for the agency or agencies for which they have been found qualified. Thereafter, they will be considered for employment based on the needs of the individual foreign affairs agencies. The candidacy of any candidate who is determined by the Final Review Panel to be unqualified for appointment shall be terminated and the candidate so informed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certification for appointment--(1) Eligibility.
