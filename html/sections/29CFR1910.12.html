The standards prescribed in part 1926 of this chapter  are adopted as occupational safety and health standards under section 6  of the Act and shall apply, according to the provisions thereof, to  every employment and place of employment of every employee engaged in  construction work. Each employer shall protect the employment and places  of employment of each of his employees engaged in construction work by  complying with the appropriate standards prescribed in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, Construction work  means work for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including  painting and decorating. See discussion of these terms in Sec. 1926.13  of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of Sec. 1926.13 of this chapter is significant in  discerning the coverage of the Construction Safety Act and duties  thereunder. However, the term ``subcontractor'' has no significance in  the application of the Act, which was enacted under the Commerce Clause  and which establishes duties for ``employers'' which are not dependent  for their application upon any contractual relationship with the Federal  Government or upon any form of Federal financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of this part, to the extent that it may not  already be included in paragraph (b) of this section, ``construction  work'' includes the erection of new electric transmission and  distribution lines and equipment, and the alteration, conversion, and  improvement of the existing transmission and distribution lines and  equipment.</p>
