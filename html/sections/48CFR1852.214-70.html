                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1814.201-670(a), insert the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Caution to Offerors Furnishing Descriptive Literature (DEC 1988)</p><p class="depth0">Bidders are cautioned against furnishing as a part of their bids descriptive literature that includes language reserving to the bidder the right to deviate from the requirements of the invitation for bids. Statements that ``Data are subject to change without notice,'' ``Prices subject to change without notice,'' or words having a similar effect are examples of such reservation. The Government will reject as nonresponsive any bid that incorporates literature containing such language or any bid that must be evaluated by using literature containing such language. Bidders should clearly label any submissions of descriptive literature not intended to form a part of a bid as such in order to preclude any need for the Government to interpret the bidder's intent in submitting descriptive literature.
