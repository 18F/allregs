                                Sec. 2201.7  Fees for copying, searching, and review.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fees required unless waived. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall  charge the fees in paragraph (b) of this section unless the fees for a  request are less than the threshold amount as provided in OSHRC's fee  schedule, in which case no fees shall be charged. See Appendix A. The  FOIA Disclosure Officer shall, however, waive the fees in the  circumstances stated in Sec. 2201.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of fees. Fees for copying, searching and reviewing  will be based on the direct costs of these services, including the  average hourly salary (base plus DC locality payment), plus 16 percent  for benefits, of the following three categories of employees involved in  responding to FOIA requests: clerical--based on an average of all  employees at GS-9 and below; professional--based on an average of all  employees at GS-10 through GS-14; and managerial--based on an average of  all employees at GS-15 and above. OSHRC will calculate a schedule of  fees based on these direct costs. The schedule of fees under this  section appears in Appendix A to this part 2201. A copy of the schedule  of fees may also be obtained at no charge from the FOIA Disclosure  Officer. See Sec. 2201.3(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copying fee. The fee per copy of each page shall be calculated  in accordance with the per-page amount established in OSHRC's fee  schedule. See Appendix A to this part. For other forms of duplication,  direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time, shall be  calculated and assessed. Copying fees shall not be charged for the first  100 pages of copies unless the copies are requested for a commercial  use. No copying fee shall be charged for educational, scientific, or  news media requests if the agency fails to comply with any time limit in  Sec. 2201.6, provided that no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as  those terms are defined in Sec. 2201.6(b) and Sec. 2201.4(e),  respectively) apply to the processing of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search fee. Search fees shall be calculated in accordance with  the amounts established in OSHRC's fee schedule. See Appendix A to this  part. Commercial requesters shall be charged for all search time, except  as described below. Search fees shall be charged even if the responsive  documents are not located or if they are located but withheld on the  basis of an exemption. However, search fees shall be limited or not  charged as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Easily identifiable decisions. Search fees shall not be charged  for searching for decisions that the requester identifies by name and  date, or by docket number, or that are otherwise easily identifiable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Educational, scientific or news media requests. No fee shall be  charged if the request is not for a commercial use and is by an  educational or scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or  scientific research, or by a representative of the news media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other non-commercial requests. No fee shall be charged for the  first two hours of searching if the request is not for a commercial use  and is not by an educational or scientific institution, or a  representative of the news media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requests for records about self. No fee shall be charged to  search for records filed in the Commission's systems of records if the  requester is the subject of the requested records. See the Privacy Act  of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) (fees to be charged only for copying).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Failure to comply with time limits. No search fee shall be  charged if the agency fails to comply with any time limit in  Sec. 2201.6, provided that no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as  those terms are defined in Sec. 2201.6(b) and Sec. 2201.4(e),  respectively) apply to the processing of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review fee. A review fee shall be charged only for commercial  requests. Review fees shall be calculated in accordance with the amounts  established in OSHRC's schedule of fees. See Appendix A. A review fee  shall be charged for the initial examination of documents located in  response to a request to determine if it may be withheld from  disclosure, and for the excision of withholdable portions. However, a  review fee shall not be charged for review by the Chairman under  Sec. 2201.9 (Appeal of denials).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Invoices. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall provide the  requester with an invoice containing an itemization of assessed fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aggregation of requests. When the FOIA Disclosure Officer  reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in  concert, is attempting to break a request into a series of requests for  the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the FOIA Disclosure  Officer may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees likely to exceed $25. If the total fee charges are likely  to exceed $25, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester of  the estimated amount of the charges, unless the requester has indicated  a willingness to pay fees up to the estimated amount. The notification  shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with the FOIA  Disclosure Officer to reformulate the request to meet the requester's  needs at a lower cost. In cases in which a requester has been notified  that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25, the request shall  not be considered received and further work shall not be done on it  until the requester agrees to pay the actual or estimated total fee. Any  such agreement shall be memorialized in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advance payments. Advance payment of fees will generally not be  required. If, however, charges are likely   to exceed $250, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester  of the likely cost and: if the requester has a history of prompt payment  of FOIA charges, obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment; or if  the requester has no history of payment, require an advance payment of  an amount up to the full estimated charge. If the requester has  previously failed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing,  the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall require the requester to pay the full  amount owed plus any interest owed as provided in paragraph (h) of this  section or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to  make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated charges  before the FOIA Disclosure Officer begins to process the new request or  a pending request from that requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fees for services not required by the Freedom of Information  Act. The Commission has discretion regarding its response to requests  for services not required by the FOIA. For example, the FOIA does not  require agencies to certify or authenticate responsive documents, nor  does it require responsive documents to be sent by express mail. If  these services are requested, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall assess  the direct costs of such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Interest on unpaid bills. The Commission's Office of  Administration shall begin assessing interest charges on unpaid bills  starting on the thirty-first day after the date the bill was sent.  Interest will accrue from the date of billing until the Commission  receives full payment. Interest will be at the rate described in 31  U.S.C. 3717.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Debt collection procedures. If bills are unpaid 60 days after  the mailing of a written notice to the requester, the Commission's  Office of Administration may resort to the debt collection procedures  set out in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat.  1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use  of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.  [71 FR 56350, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41372, July 16, 2010]</p>
