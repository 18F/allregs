It is the policy of the  Corporation to provide displaced businesses and residents with a  preferential opportunity to relocate within the development area so that  they may share in the benefits brought to the area by the implementation  of The Plan. This rule shall not be construed to affect the eligibility,  rights or responsibilities of persons who may be entitled to benefits  provided under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property  Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as implemented by the Corporation (36  CFR part 904).</p>
