                            <p class="depth0">Subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter will be followed regarding environmental requirements. The following is additional information on how to approach HPG projects under those requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The approval of an HPG grant for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of dwellings shall be a Class I action. As part of their preapplication materials, applicants shall submit Form RD 1940-20, ``Request for Environmental Information,'' for the geographical areas proposed to be served by the program. The applicant shall refer to exhibit F-1 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development State or District Office) when completing Form RD 1940-20. Further guidance on completing this form is available from the Agency office servicing the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The use of HPG funds by the grantee to repair, rehabilitate, or replace on the same site, specific dwellings is generally exempt from an RHS environmental review. However, if such dwellings are located in a floodplain, wetland, or the proposed work is not concurred in by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the requirements of Sec. 1944.673, an RHS environmental review is required. Dwellings within the Coastal Barrier Resources System are not eligible for HPG assistance. Applicants must include in their preapplication a process for identifying dwellings that may receive housing preservation or replacement housing assistance that will require an environmental assessment. This may be accomplished through use of exhibit F-2 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development State or District Office) or another process supplying similar information acceptable to RHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a specific dwelling is not located in a floodplain, wetland, or the proposed work is concurred in by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the requirements of Sec. 1944.673 of this subpart, no environmental review is required by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The grantee only needs to indicate its review and compliance with this subpart, indicating such in each recipient's file in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a dwelling requiring an environmental assessment is proposed for HPG assistance, the grantee will immediately contact the RHS office designated to service the HPG grant. Prior to approval of HPG assistance to the recipient by the grantee, RHS will prepare the environmental assessment in accordance with part 1940, subpart G, of this chapter with the assistance of the grantee, as necessary. Paragraph VIII of exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development State or District Office) provides further guidance in this area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is required to make an environmental assessment, the grantee will be provided with a copy of the assessment which will be made part of the recipient's file. The grantee must also include in each recipient's file:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documentation on how the process for historic preservation review under Sec. 1944.673 of this subpart has been complied with, including all relevant reviews and correspondence; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination as to whether the unit is located in a 100-year floodplain or a wetland.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation of this review. Suggested language is: ``We have considered this dwelling under FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's environmental and historic preservation requirements for a HPG (Secs. 1944.672 and 1944.673 of this subpart) and an environmental assessment is not required. The review was completed in accordance with the process to identify properties requiring an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 environmental assessment approved with our statement of activities.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proposed use of funds by an applicant to use monies for additions under

Sec. 1944.664 (c)(11) of this subpart must be addressed in the statement of activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grantees must contact FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prior to actual usage of funds by the grantees under Sec. 1944.664 (c)(11) of this subpart. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must complete the appropriate level of environmental review in accordance with subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter.
