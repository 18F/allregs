                                Sec. 393.43  Breakaway and emergency braking.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Towing vehicle protection system. Every motor vehicle, if used  to tow a trailer equipped with brakes, shall be equipped with a means  for providing that in the case of a breakaway of the trailer, the  service brakes on the towing vehicle will be capable of stopping the  towing vehicle. For air braked towing units, the tractor protection  valve   or similar device shall operate automatically when the air pressure on  the towing vehicle is between 138 kPa and 310 kPa (20 psi and 45 psi).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergency brake requirements, air brakes. Every truck or truck  tractor equipped with air brakes, when used for towing other vehicles  equipped with air brakes, shall be equipped with two means of activating  the emergency features of the trailer brakes. One of these means shall  operate automatically in the event of reduction of the towing vehicle  air supply to a fixed pressure which shall not be lower than 20 pounds  per square inch nor higher than 45 pounds per square inch. The other  means shall be a manually controlled device readily operable by a person  seated in the driving seat. Its emergency position or method of  operation shall be clearly indicated. In no instance may the manual  means be so arranged as to permit its use to prevent operation of the  automatic means. The automatic and manual means required by this section  may be, but are not required to be, separate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emergency brake requirements, vacuum brakes. Every truck tractor  and truck when used for towing other vehicles equipped with vacuum  brakes, shall have, in addition to the single control required by Sec.  393.49 to operate all brakes of the combination, a second manual control  device which can be used to operate the brakes on the towed vehicles in  emergencies. Such second control shall be independent of brake air,  hydraulic, and other pressure, and independent of other controls, unless  the braking system be so arranged that failure of the pressure on which  the second control depends will cause the towed vehicle brakes to be  applied automatically. The second control is not required by this rule  to provide modulated or graduated braking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Breakaway braking requirements for trailers. Every trailer  required to be equipped with brakes shall have brakes which apply  automatically and immediately upon breakaway from the towing vehicle.  With the exception of trailers having three or more axles, all brakes  with which the trailer is required to be equipped must be applied upon  breakaway from the towing vehicle. The brakes must remain in the applied  position for at least 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency valves. Air brake systems installed on towed vehicles  shall be so designed, by the use of ``no-bleed-back'' relay emergency  valves or equivalent devices, that the supply reservoir used to provide  air for brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air to the  towing vehicle upon reduction of the towing vehicle air pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception. The requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of  this section shall not be applicable to commercial motor vehicles being  transported in driveaway-towaway operations.  [53 FR 49384, Dec. 7, 1988, as amended at 70 FR 48050, Aug. 15, 2005]</p>
