                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, and section 819(b), all computations  entering into the determination of taxes imposed by part I shall be made  in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the  annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> provides that if  the minimum figure for the taxable year determined under section  819(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the surplus  held in the United States as of the end of the taxable year (as defined  in section 819(b)(2)(B) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) by a  foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business  within the United States and taxable under section 802, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the policy and other contract liability  requirements (determined under section 805 and Sec. 1.805-4 without  regard to this subparagraph), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the required interest (determined under section  809(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.809-2 without regard to this  subparagraph),  shall each be reduced by an amount determined by multiplying such excess  by the current earnings rate (as defined in section 805(b)(2) and  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.805-5) of such company. Such current  earnings rate shall be determined by reference to the assets held by the  company in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 819(b)(1) and subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term minimum figure, in the case of a taxable year beginning  after December 31, 1957, but before January 1, 1959, means the amount  obtained by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on  United States business by 9 percent. In the case of any taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1958, such term means the amount obtained  by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on United  States business by the percentage determined and proclaimed by the  Secretary as being applicable for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term surplus held in the United States means the excess of  the assets held in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year)  over the total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of  the end of the taxable year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term total insurance liabilities means the sum of the  total reserves (as defined in section 801(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.801-5) as of the end of the taxable year plus (to the extent not  included in total reserves) the items referred to in section 810(c) (3),  (4), and (5) of paragraph (b) (3), (4), and (5) of Sec. 1.810-2 as of  the end of the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term assets shall have the same meaning as that contained  in section 805(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 1.805-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 819(b) and  this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For the taxable year 1958, P, a foreign life insurance  company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States  and taxable under section 802, has total insurance liabilities on United  States business (as of the end of the taxable year) of $940,000, assets  held in the United States of $1,000,000 (as of the end of the taxable  year), policy and other contract liability requirements in the amount of  $30,000 required interest in the amount of $20,000, and a current  earnings rate of 4 percent. In order to determine whether section 819(b)  applies for the taxable year 1958, P must first compute its minimum  figure, for if the minimum figure is less than the surplus held in the  United States (as of the end of the taxable year), no section 819(b)  adjustments need be made. Since the minimum figure, $84,600 ($940,000,  the total insurance liabilities on United States business multiplied by  9 percent, the percentage applicable for 1958), exceeds the surplus held  in the United States, $60,000 (the excess of the assets held in the  United States, $1,000,000, over the total insurance liabilities on  United States business, $940,000), by $24,600, section 819(b) applies  for the taxable year 1958. Thus, the amount of the policy and other  contract liability requirements, $30,000, and the amount of the required  interest, $20,000, shall each be reduced by $984 ($24,600, the amount of  such excess, multiplied by 4 percent, the current earnings rate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Segregated asset accounts. For taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1967, pursuant to the provisions of section 801(g):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business  which issues contracts based on segregated asset accounts shall  separately compute in a manner consistent with this subparagraph the  adjustment (if any) under section 819 to the amount of policy and other  contract liability requirements and the amount of required interest  properly attributable to each of such segregated asset accounts. The  ``minimum figure'' used in section 819 in making the adjustment with  respect to each of the segregated asset accounts shall be computed as  provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in lieu of the manner  provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account  referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is the amount  determined by multiplying the total insurance liabilities on U.S.  business attributable to such a segregated asset account, by 1 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The minimum figure as computed under subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph shall be compared only with the surplus held in the United  States attributable to each segregated asset account referred to in  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Such surplus is the excess of  assets held in the United States properly attributable to such  segregated asset account over the total insurance liabilities on U.S.  business properly attributable to such account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than  segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States  attributable to such other accounts, for purposes of section 819 and  this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the company's  overall excess, as defined in this subdivision. No adjustment under  section 819 or this paragraph shall be made with respect to any account  if there is no such overall excess. For purposes of this subdivision and  of subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, the term ``overall excess''  means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate minimum figures  applicable to segregated asset accounts plus the minimum figure  applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the  surplus held in the United States with respect to the company's entire  U.S. life insurance business, including segregated asset accounts as  well as other accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a company which issues contracts based on one or  more than one segregated asset account, if the minimum figure applicable  to a segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United  States attributable to such account, then for purposes of section 819  and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the  account limitation figure, as defined in this subdivision. Therefore, no  adjustment under section 819 or under this subparagraph shall be made  with respect to any segregated asset account if the aggregate of the  account limitation figures is zero, but nothing in this subdivision  shall preclude an adjustment under section 819 with respect to accounts  other than segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision,  the term ``account limitation figure'' is a segregated assets account's  proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures.  Such aggregate of the account limitation figures is equal to the lesser  of either the company's overall excess as defined in subdivision (iv) of  this subparagraph, or the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of the  minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts exceeds the  surplus held in the United States with respect to all such segregated  asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, a segregated asset  account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation  figures is determined by multiplying the amount of such aggregate of  account limitation figures by a percentage, the numerator of which is  the amount by which the minimum figure applicable to such account  exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such  account, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the amounts by  which the minimum figure applicable to each segregated asset account  exceeds the   surplus held in the United States attributable to such account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of this  subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the taxable year 1968, T, a foreign life  insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the  United States and taxable under section 802, has the following assets  and total insurance liabilities with respect to such U.S. business:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Regular      Separate     Separate</p><p class="depth0">account     account A    account B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Assets...........................   $9,300,000   $1,810,000     $515,000 Total insurance liabilities......    8,000,000    1,800,000      500,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   It is further assumed that the percentage determined and proclaimed by  the Secretary under section 819(a)(2)(A) for the taxable year 1968 is 15  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In order to determine whether any adjustment under section 819  must be made, T must compute the minimum figure applicable to its  Regular Account as well as each of its Separate Accounts. The minimum  figure for the Regular Account is $1,200,000 (15 percent of $8,000,000).  The minimum figure applicable to Separate Account A is $18,000 (1  percent of $1,800,000). The minimum figure applicable to Separate  Account B is $5,000 (1 percent of $500,000). The aggregate of the  minimum figures is $1,223,000 ($1,200,000+$18,000+$5,000). The surplus  held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account is  $1,300,000 ($9,300,000-$8,000,000), with respect to Separate Account A  is $10,000 ($1,810,000-$1,800,000) and with respect to Separate Account  B is $15,000 ($515,000-$500,000). The surplus held in the United States  with respect to T's entire U.S. life insurance business is $1,325,000  ($1,300,000+$10,000+$15,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Since the aggregate of the minimum figures ($1,223,000) does not  exceed the surplus held in the United States attributable to T's entire  U.S. life insurance business ($1,325,000), under subdivision (iv) of  this subparagraph no adjustment under section 819 shall be made with  respect to the Regular Account or either of the Separate Accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 except that  the assets held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account  is $8,300,000 instead of $9,300,000. Thus, the surplus held in the  United States with respect to the Regular Account is $300,000  ($8,300,000-$8,000,000), and the surplus held in the United States with  respect to T's entire U.S. life insurance business is $325,000  ($300,000+$10,000 +$15,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Since the aggregate of the minimum figures with respect to the  Separate Accounts, $23,000 ($18,000+$5,000), does not exceed the surplus  held in the United States with respect to both of such Separate  Accounts, $25,000 ($10,000+$15,000), under subdivision (v) of this  subparagraph, no adjustment under section 819 must be made with respect  to either of the Separate Accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The excess of the minimum figure for the Regular Account  ($1,200,000) over the surplus held in the United States with respect to  the Regular Account ($300,000) is equal to $900,000 ($1,200,000- $300,000). However, the company's overall excess as defined in  subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, is $898,000 ($1,223,000- $325,000). Under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph the excess with  respect to the Regular Account ($900,000) is limited to the amount of  overall excess ($898,000). Thus, the amount of policy and other contract  liability requirements with respect to T's Regular Account and the  amount of required interest with respect to T's Regular Account (both  computed without regard to section 819) shall each be reduced by an  amount equal to the product of $898,000 and the current earnings rate  computed only with respect to T's Regular Account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and this subparagraph it desires, and the method  elected for any one taxable year shall be effective only with respect to  the taxable year for which the election is made. Such alternative  methods are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the distributions to shareholders shall be the  amount determined by multiplying the total amount of distributions to  shareholders by the percentage which the minimum figure for the taxable  year is of the excess of the assets of the company over the total  insurance liabilities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the distributions for shareholders shall be the  amount determined by multiplying the total   amount of distributions for shareholders by the percentage which the  total insurance liabilities on United States business for the taxable  year is of the total insurance liabilities of the company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 819(c)(1) and subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term total amount of the distributions to shareholders means  all distributions (within the meaning of section 815 and Sec. 1.815-2)  by a foreign life insurance company to all of its shareholders whether  or not in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term minimum figure for the taxable year means the amount  determined under section 819(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term assets of the company means all of the assets (as  defined in section 805(b) (4) and paragraph (a) (4) of Sec. 1.805-5) of  the foreign life insurance company whether or not in the United States  (as of the end of the taxable year); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term total insurance liabilities of the company means the  total insurance liabilities (as defined in section 819(b)(2) and  paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on all of its business whether or not  in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 819(c)(1)  and subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For the taxable year 1958, T, a foreign life insurance  company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States  and taxable under section 802, has a minimum figure of $40,000, total  amount of distributions to all shareholders (within the meaning of  section 815) of $5,000, assets (as of the end of the year) of $500,000,  total insurance liabilities (as of the end of the year) of $450,000, and  total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of the end of  the year) of $180,000. Based upon these facts, if T elects the method  provided in section 819(c)(1)(A) and subparagraph (1)(i) of this  paragraph, the amount of T's distributions to shareholders for the  taxable year 1958 is $4,000, that is, $5,000 (the total amount of  distributions to shareholders) multiplied by 80 percent (the percentage  which the minimum figure for the taxable year, $40,000, is of $50,000,  the excess of the assets of the company ($500,000) over the total  insurance liabilities ($450,000)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that for  the taxable year 1958, T elects the method provided in section  819(c)(1)(B) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. Based upon  these facts, the amount of T's distributions to shareholders for the  taxable year 1958 is $2,000, that is, $5,000 (the total amount of  distributions to shareholders) multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage  which the total insurance liabilities on United States business  ($180,000) is of the total insurance liabilities of the company  ($450,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Manner and effect of election. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The election provided by  section 819(c)(1) shall be made in a statement attached to the foreign  life insurance company's income tax return for any taxable year for  which the company desires the election to apply. The return and  statement must be filed not later than the date prescribed by law  (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable  year. The statement shall indicate the method elected, the name and  address of the taxpayer, and shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his  duly authorized representative).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election made under section 819(c)(1) and this paragraph  shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the  election is made. Thus, the company must make a new election for each  taxable year for which it desires the election to apply. Once such  election has been made for any taxable year it may not be revoked.  However, for taxable years beginning prior to April 4, 1961, a company  may revoke the election provided by section 819(c)(1) without obtaining  consent from the Commissioner by filing, before July 4, 1961, a  statement that the company desires to revoke such election. An amended  return reflecting such revocation and the selection of the other  percentage must accompany the statement for all taxable years for which  returns have been filed with respect to such election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application of section 815. Once the amount of distributions to  shareholders is determined under the provisions of section 819(c)(1) and  this paragraph, the rules of section 815 (relating to distributions to  shareholders) shall   apply to the shareholders surplus account and the policyholders surplus  account of a foreign stock life insurance company in the same manner as  they would apply to a domestic stock life insurance company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Distributions pursuant to certain mutualizations. Section  819(c)(2) provides that for purposes of applying section 815(e) and  paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.815-6 (relating to a special rule for certain  mutualizations) in the case of a foreign life insurance company subject  to tax under section 802:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(B))</em>, is whichever of the  following is the greater:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The minimum figure for 1958 determined under section  819(b)(2)(A); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The surplus held in the United States (as defined in section  819(b)(2)(B)) determined as of December 31, 1958.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No United States insurance business.
