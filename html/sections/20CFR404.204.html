                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. We compute most workers' primary insurance amounts  under one of two major methods. There are, in addition, several special  methods of computing primary insurance amounts which we apply to some  workers. Your primary insurance amount is the highest of all those  computed under the methods for which you are eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Major methods. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If after 1978 you reach age 62, or become  disabled or die before age 62, we compute your primary insurance amount  under what we call the average-indexed-monthly-earnings method, which is  described in Secs. 404.210 through 404.212. The earliest of the three  dates determines the computation method we use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If before 1979 you reached age 62, became disabled, or died, we  compute your primary insurance amount under what we call the average- monthly-wage method, described in Secs. 404.220 through 404.222.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special methods. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your primary insurance amount, computed  under any of the special methods for which you are eligible as described  in this paragraph, may be substituted for your primary insurance amount  computed under either major method described in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you reach age 62 during the period 1979-1983, your primary  insurance amount is guaranteed to be the highest of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The primary insurance amount we compute for you under the  average-indexed-monthly-earnings method;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The primary insurance amount we compute for you under the  average-monthly-wage method, as modified by the rules described in  Secs. 404.230 through 404.233; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The primary insurance amount computed under what we call the  old-start method; as described in Secs. 404.240 through 404.242.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you had all or substantially all of your social security  earnings before 1951, we will also compute your primary insurance amount  under what we call the old-start method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We compute your primary insurance amount under the rules in  Secs. 404.250 through 404.252, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You were disabled and received social security disability  insurance benefits sometime in your life;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your disability insurance benefits were terminated because of  your recovery or because you engaged in substantial gainful activity;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You are, after 1978, re-entitled to disability insurance  benefits, or entitled to old-age insurance benefits, or have died.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In some situations, we use what we call a special minimum  computation, described in Secs. 404.260 through 404.261, to find your  primary insurance amount. Computations under this method reflect long- term, low-wage attachment to covered work.</p><p class="depth3">Average-Indexed-Monthly-Earnings Method of Computing Primary Insurance</p><p class="depth3">Amounts</p>
