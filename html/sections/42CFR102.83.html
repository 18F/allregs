                                Sec.  102.83  Payment of all benefits.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may pay any benefits under this Program through  lump-sum payments. If the Secretary determines that there is a  reasonable likelihood that the payments of medical benefits, benefits  for lost employment income, or death benefits paid under the alternative  calculation (described in Sec.  102.82(d)) will be required for a period  in excess of one year from the date the Secretary determines the  requester is eligible for such benefits, the Secretary may make a lump- sum payment, purchase an annuity or medical insurance policy, or execute  an appropriate structured settlement agreement, provided that such  payment, annuity, policy, or agreement is actuarially determined to have  a value equal to the present value of the projected total amount of  benefits that the requester is eligible to receive under Sec. Sec.   102.80, 102.81, and 102.82(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lump sum payments will be made through an electronic funds  transfer to an account of the requester. However, if the requester is a  minor, the payment will be made to the account of his or her legal  guardian on behalf of the minor. In accepting such payments, the legal  guardian of a minor requester is obliged to use the funds for the  benefit of the minor and to take any actions necessary to comply with  state law requirements pertaining to such payments. If the requester is  a legally incompetent adult, the legal guardian must establish a  guardianship or conservatorship of the estate account with court  oversight, in accordance with State law, and payment will be made to  that account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary may, at his discretion, make interim payments of  benefits under this Program, even before he makes a final determination  as to the total type and total amount of benefits that will be paid. The  Secretary may, for example, make an interim payment   of medical benefits that have been calculated before a final  determination on benefits for lost employment income is completed, or of  past medical benefits that have been calculated before a final  calculation of future medical benefits is completed. The Secretary may,  in his discretion, make an interim payment even before a final  eligibility or benefits determination is made (e.g., if a piece of  documentation has not been obtained because a person with a severe  vaccine-related injury is hospitalized, but all other documentation is  consistent with the requester meeting the eligibility requirements). If  such a requester's documentation is incomplete, the requester must  submit the required documentation within the time-frame determined by  the Secretary. Such a requester must agree that he or she will be  obliged to repay the Secretary such benefits in the event that such  payments are later determined to be inappropriate. Any payments made on  an interim basis will not entitle a requester to seek reconsideration of  the Secretary's decision on these benefits until the Secretary makes a  complete benefits determination.
