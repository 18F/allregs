                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Separate insurance coverage. Through December 31, 2012, a  member's funds in a ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' (as  defined in Sec. 745.1(f) of this part) are fully insured, irrespective  of the SMSIA. Such insurance coverage shall be separate from the  coverage provided for other accounts maintained at the same insured  credit union.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain swept funds. NCUA will treat funds swept from a  noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings  deposit account as being in a noninterest-bearing transaction account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure and notice requirements. (1) Each insured credit  union that offers noninterest-bearing transaction accounts must post  prominently the following notice in the lobby of its main office, in  each branch and, if it offers internet deposit services, on its Web  site:</p><p class="depth0">NOTICE OF CHANGES IN TEMPORARY NCUA INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR TRANSACTION</p><p class="depth0">ACCOUNTS</p><p class="depth0">All funds in a ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' are  insured in full by the National Credit Union Administration through  December 31, 2012. This temporary unlimited coverage is in addition to,  and separate from, the coverage of at least $250,000 available to  members under the NCUA's general share insurance rules.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' includes a  traditional share draft account (or demand deposit account) on which the  insured credit union pays no interest or dividend. It does not include  any transaction account that may earn interest or dividends, a  negotiable order of withdrawal (``NOW'') account, money-market deposit  account, and Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (``IOLTA''), even if  share drafts may be drawn on the account. For more information about  temporary NCUA insurance coverage of transaction accounts, visit  www.ncua.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an insured credit union uses sweep arrangements, modifies the  terms of an account, or takes other actions that result in funds no  longer being eligible for full coverage under this section, the insured  credit union must notify affected members and clearly advise them, in  writing, that such actions will affect their share insurance coverage.
