                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Merchandise in transit proceeding under the provisions  of this subpart may be transshipped from one   conveyance to another in foreign territory. When transshipment requires  the breaking of Customs seals, the breaking of the seals, transshipment  and sealing of the conveyance or compartment to which the merchandise is  transshipped shall be under the supervision of a Customs officer. He  shall note his action on both the additional copy of the manifest  presented to him, in accordance with Sec. 123.25(b), and on the  original copy, which shall be returned to the person in charge of the  conveyance to accompany the merchandise. Merchandise transshipped in  foreign territory without customs supervision when Customs seals were  broken shall be treated upon return to the United States as imported  merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Storage awaiting transshipment. Merchandise moving under in- transit manifests and Customs seals which is to be stored in foreign  territory awaiting transshipment shall be checked into a storehouse by  the Customs officer at the place of transshipment. It shall remain under  Customs locks and seals until transshipment is completed under Customs  supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manifests where contents broken up. When transshipment involves  the breaking up of the in-transit contents of a conveyance or  compartment, in such a manner as to require separate manifests for  articles previously covered by a single manifest, the Customs officer  supervising the transshipment shall take up the carrier's copy of the  manifest and require the carrier to prepare a new manifest, in  duplicate, for each conveyance to which the merchandise is transshipped.  If there is to be further transshipment, an additional copy of each new  manifest shall be presented by the carrier, and shall be returned to the  person in charge of the carrier for delivery to the Customs officer at  the point of further transshipment in accordance with Sec. 123.25(b).  After the transshipment and sealing of the conveyances and compartments  has been supervised and the new manifests certified the originals of the  new manifests shall be returned to the carrier to accompany the  merchandise to the point of reentry into the United States.</p>
