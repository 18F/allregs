Except as specifically  indicated below, these appellate procedures are to be followed in  abandonment and discontinuance proceedings in lieu of the general  procedures at 49 CFR 1115.

Those decisions  are administratively final upon the date they are served.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Parties seeking further administrative action may file a  petition to reopen the proceeding under paragraph (e)(4) of this  section. If an abandonment or discontinuance is granted and a party  wishes the Board to have the opportunity to consider a petition to  reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance authorization becomes  effective, it must file its petition within 15 days after the  administratively final decision is served together with a request for a  stay of effectiveness under paragraph (e)(7) of this section. If such a  petition to reopen and stay request is received within that 15-day  period, any replies to the petition to reopen must be filed no later  than 25 days after the date the decision is served, and any reply to the  stay request must reach the Board no later than 5 days after the stay  request is filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Board will grant a petition to reopen only upon a showing  that the action would be affected materially because of new evidence,  changed circumstances, or material error.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Form.

In the event of procedural defects (such as  the loss of a properly filed protest, the failure of the   applicant to afford the public the requisite notice of its proposed  abandonment, etc.), the Board will entertain petitions to vacate the  abandonment or discontinuance authorization. An original and 10 copies  of these petitions to vacate must be filed with the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Petitions to stay. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The filing of a petition to reopen shall  not stay the effect of a prior action. An original and 10 copies of any  petitions to stay must be filed with the Board.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A petition to reopen an administratively final action may be  accompanied by a petition for a stay of the effectiveness of the  abandonment or discontinuance.

The reasons for the desired relief shall be stated in  the petition, and the petition shall be filed not less than 15 days  prior to the effective date of the abandonment authorization. No reply  need be filed. If a party elects to file a reply, the reply must reach  the Board no later than 5 days after the petition is filed.
