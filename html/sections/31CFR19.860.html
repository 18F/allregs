                                Sec. 19.860  What factors may influence the debarring official's
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to

one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Whether your principals tolerated the offense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.</p>
