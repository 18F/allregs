For project  or activity proposals made below the level of the Chief, the reviewing  officer is the Forest Service line officer at the next higher  administrative level above the responsible official, or the respective  Associate Deputy Chief, Deputy Regional Forester, or Deputy Forest  Supervisor with the delegation of authority relevant to the provisions  of this part. When a project or activity proposal is made by the Chief,  the Secretary of Agriculture or Under Secretary, Natural Resources and  Environment is the reviewing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The reviewing officer determines procedures to be used for  processing objections when the procedures are not specifically described  in this part, including, to the extent practicable, such procedures as  needed to be compatible with the administrative review processes of  other Federal agencies, when projects are proposed jointly. Such  determinations are not subject to further administrative review.</p>
