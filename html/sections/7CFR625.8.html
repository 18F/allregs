The payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests  and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement or 30-year  contract. By voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner  waives any claim to additional compensation based on fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments may be made in a single payment or no more than 10  annual payments of equal or unequal size, as agreed to between NRCS and  the landowner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If a landowner believes they may be eligible for a bargain sale  tax deduction that is the difference between the fair market value of  the easement conveyed to the United States and the easement payment made  to the landowner, it is the landowner's responsibility to discuss those  matters with the Internal Revenue Service. NRCS disclaims any  representations concerning the tax implications of any easement or cost- share transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Per acre payments. If easement payments are calculated on a per  acre basis, adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on  final determination of acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Ecosystem Services Credits for Conservation Improvements. USDA  recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing  conservation practices and activities funded through HFRP, and that  environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing  activities compatible with the purposes of a HFRP easement, 30-year  contract, or restoration cost-share agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or  indirect interest in these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority  to ensure the requirements of a HFRP easement, contract, cost-share  agreement, or restoration plan are met consistent with Sec. Sec. 625.9  through 625.13 of this part. Where activities required under an  environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a HFRP  easement, restoration cost-share agreement, or 30-year contract,  participants are highly encouraged to request a compatibility assessment  from NRCS prior to entering into such agreements.
