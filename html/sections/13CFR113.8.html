                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders of like directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, marital status, age, or national origin and which authorize the suspension or termination of a refusal to grant to or to continue financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction or like direction prior to the effective date of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Forms and instructions. SBA shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Supervision and coordination. The Administrator may from time-to-time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of the Government, with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of this part (other than responsibility of first decisions as provided in Sec. 113.9) including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within SBA and within the executive branch of the Government in the application of this part and of comparable regulations issued by other agencies of the Government to similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the Administrator of SBA.
