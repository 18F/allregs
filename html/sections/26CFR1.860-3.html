                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a qualified investment entity is allowed a  deduction for deficiency dividends with respect to a taxable year, under  section 860(c)(1) the tax imposed on the entity by chapter 1 of the Code  (computed by taking into account the deduction) for that year is deemed  to be increased by the amount of the deduction. This deemed increase in  tax, however, applies solely for purposes of determining the liability  of the entity for interest under subchapter A of chapter 67 of the Code  and for additions to tax and additional amounts under chapter 68 of the  Code. For purposes of applying subchapter A of chapter 67 and 68, the  last date prescribed for payment of the deemed increase in tax is  considered to be the last date prescribed for the payment of tax  (determined in the manner provided in section 6601(b)) for the taxable  year for which the deduction for deficiency dividends is allowed. The  deemed increase in tax is considered to be paid as of the date that the  claim for the deficiency dividend deduction described in section 860(g)  is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overpayments of tax. If a qualified investment entity is  entitled to a credit or refund of an overpayment of the tax imposed by  chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year for which the deficiency  dividend deduction is allowed, then, for purposes of computing interest,  additions to tax, and additional amounts, the payment (or payments) that  result in the overpayment and that precede the filing of the claim  described in section 860(g) will be applied against and reduce the  increase in tax that is deemed to occur under section 860(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. This section is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X is a real estate investment trust that  files its income tax return on a calendar year basis. X receives an  extension of time until June 15, 1978, to file its 1977 income tax  return and files the return on May 15, 1978. X does not elect to pay any  tax due in installments. For 1977, X reports real estate investment  trust taxable income (computed without the dividends paid deduction) of  $100, a dividends paid deduction of $100, and no tax liability.  Following an examination of X's 1977 return, the district director and X  enter into an agreement which is a determination under section  860(e)(3). The determination is dated November 1, 1979, and increases  X's real estate investment trust taxable income (computed without the  dividends paid deduction) by $20 to $120. Thus, taking into account the  $100 of dividends paid in 1977, X has undistributed real estate  investment trust taxable income of $20 as a result of the determination.  X pays a dividend of $20 on November 10, 1979, files a claim for a  deficiency dividend deduction of this $20 pursuant to section 860(g) on  November 15, 1979, and is allowed a deficiency dividend deduction of $20  for 1977. After taking into account this deduction, X has no real estate  investment trust taxable income and meets the distribution requirements  of section 857(a)(1). However, for purposes of section 6601 (relating to  interest on underpayment of tax), the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the  Code on X for 1977 is deemed increased by this $20, and the last date  prescribed for payment of the tax is March 15, 1978 (the due date of the  1977 return determined without any extension of time). The tax of $20 is  deemed paid on November 15, 1979, the date the claim for the deficiency  dividend deduction is filed. Thus, X is liable for interest on $20, at  the rate established under section 6621, for the period from March 15,  1978, to November 15, 1979. Also, for purposes of determining whether X  is liable for any addition to tax or additional amount imposed by  chapter 68 of the Code (including the penalty prescribed by section  6697), the amount of tax imposed on X by chapter 1 of the Code is deemed  to be increased by $20 (the amount of the deficiency dividend deduction  allowed), the last date prescribed for payment of such tax is March 15,  1978, and the tax of $20 is deemed to be paid on November 15, 1979. X,  however, is not subject to interest and penalties for the amount of any  tax for which it would have been liable under section 11(a), 56(a),  1201(a), or 857(b) had it not been allowed the $20 deduction for  deficiency dividends.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1) except  that the district director, upon examining X's income tax return,  asserts an income tax deficiency of $4, based on an asserted increase of  $10 in real estate investment trust taxable income, and no agreement is  entered into between the parties. X pays the $4 on June 1, 1979, and  files suit for refund in the United States District Court. The District  Court, in a decision which becomes final on November 1, 1980, holds that  X did fail to report $10 of real estate investment trust taxable income  and is not entitled to any refund. (No other item of income or deduction  is in issue.) X pays a dividend of $10 on November 10, 1980, files a  claim for a deficiency dividend deduction of this $10 on November 15,  1980, and is allowed a deficiency dividend deduction of $10 for 1977.  Assume further that $4 is refunded to X on December 31, 1980, as the  result of the $10 deficiency dividend deduction being allowed. Also  assume that any assessable penalties, additional amounts, and additions  to tax (including the penalty imposed by section 6697) for which X is  liable are paid within 10 days of notice and demand, so that no interest  is imposed on such penalties, etc. X's liability for interest for the  period March 15, 1978, to June 1, 1979, is determined with respect to  $10 (the amount of the deficiency dividend deduction allowed). X's  liability for interest for the period June 1, 1979, to November 15,  1980, is determined with respect to $6, i.e., $10 minus the $4 payment.  X is entitled to interest on the $4 overpayment for the period described  in section 6611(b)(2), beginning on November 15, 1980.  (Sec. 7805, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805; sec. 860(e) (92 Stat. 2849,  26 U.S.C. 860(e)); sec. 860(g) (92 Stat. 2850, 26 U.S.C. 860(g)))  [T.D. 7936, 49 FR 2108, Jan. 18, 1984]</p>
