Post-grant review shall not be instituted for a ground of unpatentability, unless the Board decides that the petition supporting the ground would, if unrebutted, demonstrate that it is more likely than not that at least one of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable. The Board's decision will take into account a patent owner preliminary response where such a response is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional grounds. Sufficient grounds under Sec.  42.208(c) may be a showing that the petition raises a novel or unsettled legal question that is important to other patents or patent applications.</p><p class="depth2">After Institution of Post-Grant Review</p>
