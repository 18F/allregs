                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope of test. The appropriate Federal banking agency assesses a wholesale or limited purpose savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) under the community development test through its community development lending, qualified investments, or community development services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designation as a wholesale or limited purpose savings association. In order to receive a designation as a wholesale or limited purpose savings association, a savings association shall file a request, in writing, with the appropriate Federal banking agency, at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the designation. If the appropriate Federal banking agency approves the designation, it remains in effect until the savings association requests revocation of the designation or until one year after the appropriate Federal banking agency notifies the savings association that the appropriate Federal banking agency has revoked the designation on its own initiative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Performance criteria. The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the community development performance of a wholesale or limited purpose savings association pursuant to the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number and amount of community development loans (including originations and purchases of loans and other community development loan data provided by the savings association, such as data on loans outstanding, commitments, and letters of credit), qualified investments, or community development services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The use of innovative or complex qualified investments, community development loans, or community development services and the extent to which the investments are not routinely provided by private investors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The savings association's responsiveness to credit and community development needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Indirect activities. At a savings association's option, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider in its community development performance assessment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified investments or community development services provided by an affiliate of the savings association, if the investments or services are not claimed by any other institution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Community development lending by affiliates, consortia and third parties, subject to the requirements and limitations in Sec. 195.22(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Benefit to assessment area(s)--(1) Benefit inside assessment area(s). The appropriate Federal banking agency considers all qualified investments, community development loans, and community development services that benefit areas within the savings association's assessment area(s) or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the savings association's assessment area(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefit outside assessment area(s). The appropriate Federal banking agency considers the qualified investments, community development loans, and community development services that benefit areas outside the savings association's assessment area(s), if the savings association has adequately addressed the needs of its assessment area(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Community development performance rating. The appropriate Federal banking agency rates a savings association's community development performance as provided in appendix A of this part.</p>
