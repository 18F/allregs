A measurement of the actual ratio is not necessary for each record as long as the owner or operator has a reliable method for making the required determination. For example, the record may be made by comparing the HAP solvent level to a permanent mark on the sink that corresponds to a 75 percent freeboard ratio. A HAP solvent level in the sink higher than the mark would indicate the minimum ratio has not been achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart that is subject to the requirements of Sec.  63.704(c)(10) shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If complying with Sec.  63.704(c)(10)(i), maintain hourly records of whether the flow indicator was operating and whether flow was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times and durations of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the monitor is not operating;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If complying with Sec.  63.704(c)(10) (ii), (iii), or (iv), maintain a record of monthly inspections, and the records of the times and durations of all periods when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow was diverted through any bypass line such that the seal mechanism was broken;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The key for a lock-and-key type lock had been checked out;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The valve position on any bypass line changed to the open position; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The diversion of flow through any bypass line caused a shutdown of HAP-emitting operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source that is complying with Sec.  63.703(c) by performing a material balance in accordance with Sec.  63.705(c)(1) shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintain a record of each 7-day rolling average calculation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain a record of the certification of the accuracy of the device that measures the amount of HAP or VOC recovered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator of a magnetic tape manufacturing operation subject to the provisions of Sec.  63.703 (b) and (h) shall maintain records of the calculations used to determine the limits on the amount of HAP utilized as specified in Sec.  63.703(b)(2), and of the HAP utilized in each month and the sum over each 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of Sec.  63.703(c)(5) shall keep records of the HAP content of each batch of coating applied as calculated according to Sec.  63.705(c)(5), and records of the formulation data that support the calculations. When a batch of coating applied is identical to a previous batch applied, only one set of records is required to be kept.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source that is complying with Sec.  63.703(c)(1) through the use of a nonregenerative carbon adsorber and demonstrating initial compliance in accordance with Sec.  63.705(c)(6) shall maintain records to support the outlet VOC or HAP concentration value or the carbon replacement time established as the site-specific operating parameter to demonstrate compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In accordance with Sec.  63.10(b)(1) of subpart A, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall retain all records required by this subpart and subpart A for at least 5 years following their collection.</p>
