                            <p class="depth0">Technical assistance grants may be funded in such amounts, and in accordance with such terms and conditions, as NCUA may establish. In general, technical assistance grants are provided on a reimbursement basis, to cover expenditures approved in advance by NCUA and supported by receipts evidencing payment by the Participating Credit Union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permissible uses of technical assistance grant funds. Section 705.4(a) and (b) of this part also apply to technical assistance grants made under this section. Those sections provide examples and other information with respect to the permissible use of CDRLF funds. In addition, technical assistance grants generally should enhance and support the Participating Credit Union's internal capacity to serve its members and better enable it to provide financial services to the community in which the Participating Credit Union is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursement denials. Pursuant to NCUA Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 11-1, any Participating Credit Union may appeal a denial of a technical assistance grant reimbursement to NCUA's Supervisory Review Committee. All appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursements must be submitted to the Supervisory Review

Committee within 30 days from the date of the denial. The decisions of the Supervisory Review Committee are final and may not be appealed to the NCUA Board.</p>
