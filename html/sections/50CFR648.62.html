                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a vessel has been issued a NGOM scallop permit, the vessel is  restricted to fishing for or possessing scallops only in the NGOM  scallop management area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scallop landings by vessels issued NGOM permits shall be  deducted from the NGOM scallop total allowable catch when vessels fished  all or part of a trip in the Federal waters portion of the NGOM. If a  vessel with a NGOM scallop permit fishes exclusively in state waters  within the NGOM, scallop landings from those trips will not be deducted  from the Federal NGOM quota.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scallop landings by all vessels issued LAGC IFQ scallop permits  and fishing in the NGOM scallop management area shall be deducted from  the NGOM scallop total allowable catch specified in paragraph (b) of  this section. Scallop landings by IFQ scallop vessels fishing in the  NGOM scallop management area shall be deducted from their respective  scallop IFQs. Landings by incidental catch scallop vessels and limited  access scallop vessels fishing under the scallop DAS program shall not  be deducted from the NGOM total allowable catch specified in paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A vessel issued a NGOM or IFQ scallop permit that fishes in the  NGOM may fish for, possess, or retain up to   200 lb (90.7 kg) of shucked or 25 bu (8.81 hL) of in-shell scallops, and  may possess up to 50 bu (17.6 hL) of in-shell scallops seaward of the  VMS Demarcation Line. A vessel issued an incidental catch general  category scallop permit that fishes in the NGOM may fish for, possess,  or retain only up to 40 lb of shucked or 5 U.S. bu (1.76 hL) of in-shell  scallops, and may possess up to 10 bu (3.52 hL) of in-shell scallops  seaward of the VMS Demarcation Line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Total allowable catch. The total allowable catch for the NGOM  scallop management area shall be specified through the framework  adjustment process. The total allowable catch for the NGOM scallop  management area shall be based on the Federal portion of the scallop  resource in the NGOM. The total allowable catch shall be determined by  historical landings until additional information on the NGOM scallop  resource is available, for example through an NGOM resource survey and  assessment. The ABC/ACL as specified in Sec. 648.53(a) shall not include  the total allowable catch for the NGOM scallop management area, and  landings from the NGOM scallop management area shall not be counted  against the ABC/ACL specified in Sec. 648.53(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NGOM annual hard TACs. The annual hard TAC for the NGOM is  70,000 lb (31.8 mt) for the 2013 and 2014 fishing years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> may possess, retain, or land scallops in the NGOM  scallop management area once the Regional Administrator has provided  notification in the Federal Register that the NGOM scallop total  allowable catch in accordance with this paragraph (b) has been reached.  Once the NGOM hard TAC is reached, a vessel issued a NGOM permit may no  longer declare a state-only NGOM scallop trip and fish for scallops  exclusively in state waters within the NGOM. A vessel that has not been  issued a Federal scallop permit that fishes exclusively in state waters  is not subject to the closure of the NGOM scallop management area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the TAC specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is  exceeded, the amount of NGOM scallop landings in excess of the TAC  specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be deducted from the  NGOM TAC for the subsequent fishing year, as soon as practicable, once  scallop landings data for the NGOM fishery is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VMS requirements. Except scallop vessels issued a limited access  scallop permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(i) that have declared a trip  under the scallop DAS program, a vessel issued a scallop permit pursuant  to Sec. 648.4(a)(2) that intends to fish for scallops in the NGOM  scallop management area or fishes for, possesses, or lands scallops in  or from the NGOM scallop management area, must declare a NGOM scallop  management area trip and report scallop catch through the vessel's VMS  unit, as required in Sec. 648.10. If the vessel has a NGOM permit, the  vessel can declare either a Federal NGOM trip or a state-waters NGOM  trip. If a vessel intends to fish any part of a NGOM trip in Federal  NGOM waters, it may not declare into the state water NGOM fishery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gear restrictions. Except scallop vessels issued a limited  access scallop permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(i) that have properly  declared a trip under the scallop DAS program, the combined dredge width  in use by, or in possession on board, LAGC scallop vessels fishing in  the NGOM scallop management area may not exceed 10.5 ft (3.2 m),  measured at the widest point in the bail of the dredge.
