                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The right to terminate a cost-reimbursement contract for default  is provided for in the Termination for Default or for Convenience of the  Government clause at 52.249-6. A 10-day notice to the contractor before  termination for default is required in every case by the clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlement of a cost-reimbursement contract terminated for  default is subject to the principles in subparts 49.1 and 49.3 the same  as when a contract is terminated for convenience, except that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs of preparing the contractor's settlement proposal are  not allowable (see subparagraph (h)(3) of the clause); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contractor is reimbursed the allowable costs, and an  appropriate reduction is made in the total fee, if any, (see  subparagraph (h)(4) of the clause).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contracting officer shall use the procedures in 49.402 to  the extent appropriate in considering the termination for default of a  cost-reimbursement contract. However, a cost-reimbursement contract does  not contain any provision for recovery of excess repurchase costs after  termination for default (but see paragraph (g) of the clause at 52.246-3  with respect to failure of the contractor to replace or correct  defective supplies).
