The SIP revisions, to be submitted by Pennsylvania on behalf of Philadelphia County, will address source-specific RACT determinations for ten (10) major sources in Philadelphia County and will include a certification that previously adopted source-specific RACT controls approved by EPA in Pennsylvania's SIP under the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for the remaining sources in Philadelphia County (as listed in 40 CFR 52.2020(d)(1)) continue to adequately represent RACT for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> EPA conditionally approves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania SIP revision submitted on November 15, 2013, which consists of amendments to the ACHD Rules and Regulations, Article XXI, Air Pollution Control for adopting RACT for sources covered by EPA's CTG standards for the following categories: Miscellaneous metal and/or plastic parts surface coating processes, automobile and light-duty truck assembly coatings, miscellaneous industrial adhesives, and fiberglass boat manufacturing materials.
