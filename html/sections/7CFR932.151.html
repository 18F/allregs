Noncanning olives that have been  reported on Form COC-5 and inspected by the Inspection Service shall,  unless such olives are disposed of immediately after being inspected  under supervision of the inspector, be identified by fixing to each bin  or pallet of boxes an COC control card which may be obtained from the  committee. Such olives shall be kept separate and apart from other  olives in the handler's possession and shall be disposed of only in the  outlet shown on Form COC-5 and under the supervision of an inspector of  the Inspection Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time period for disposition.
