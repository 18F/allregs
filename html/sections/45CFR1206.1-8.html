                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each decision of a presiding officer shall contain his findings  of fact, and conclusions, and shall state whether he has accepted or  rejected each proposed finding of fact and conclusion submitted by the  parties, pursuant to Sec. 1206.1-7(m). Findings of fact shall be based  only upon evidence submitted to the presiding officer and matters of  which official notice has been taken. The decision shall also specify  the requirement or requirements with which it is found that the  recipient has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The decision of the presiding officer may provide for continued  suspension or termination of assistance to the recipient in whole or in  part, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as  are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the DVSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the hearing is held by an independent hearing examiner rather  than by the responsible Corporation official, he shall make an initial  decision, and a copy of this initial decision shall be   mailed to all parties. Any party may, within 20 days of the mailing of  such initial decision, or such longer period of time as the presiding  officer specifies, file with the responsible Corporation official his  written exceptions to the initial decision and any supporting brief or  statement. Upon the filing of such exceptions, the responsible  Corporation official shall, within 20 days of the mailing of the  exceptions, review the initial decision and issue his own written  decision thereof, including the reasons therefore. The decision of the  responsible Corporation official may increase, modify, approve, vacate,  remit, or mitigate any sanction imposed in the initial decision or may  remand the matter to the presiding officer for further hearing or  consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a hearing is waived, a decision shall be made by the  responsible Corporation official and a written copy of the final  decision of the responsible Corporation official shall be given to the  recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The recipient may request the CEO to review a final decision by  the responsible Corporation official which provides for the termination  of assistance. Such a request must be made in writing within 15 days  after the recipient has been notified of the decision in question and  must state in detail the reasons for seeking the review. In the event  the recipient requests such a review, the CEO or his designee shall  consider the reasons stated by the recipient for seeking the review and  shall approve, modify, vacate or mitigate any sanction imposed by the  responsible Corporation official or remand the matter to the responsible  Corporation official for further hearing or consideration. The decision  of the responsible Corporation official will be given great weight by  the CEO or his designee during the review. During the course of his  review the CEO or his designee may, but is not required to, hold a  hearing or allow the filing of briefs and arguments. Pending the  decision of the CEO or his designee assistance shall remain suspended  under the terms and conditions specified by the responsible Corporation  official, unless the responsible Corporation official or the CEO or his  designee otherwise determines. Every reasonable effort shall be made to  complete the review by the CEO or his designee within 30 days of receipt  by the CEO of the recipient's request. The CEO or his designee may  however extend this period of time if he determines that additional time  is necessary for an adequate review.</p>
