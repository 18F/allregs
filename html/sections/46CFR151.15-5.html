                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section contains definitions and requirements for the various methods of venting specified in Table 151.05. In addition to the requirement that all vents must penetrate into tanks at the top of the vapor space, the following methods of venting and the applicable restrictions are listed:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Open venting. A venting system which offers no restriction (except pipe losses and flame screen, where used) to the movement of liquid or vapor to or from the cargo tank (via the vent) under normal operating conditions. The total cross-sectional area of the vents shall not be less than the total cross-sectional area of the filling pipe or pipes. Ullage openings may be counted as part of the required cross-sectional area: Provided, That each cargo tank has at least one permanent vent. The minimum size of a cargo tank vent shall be not less than 2\1/2\ inches. The outlet end of the vent shall terminate in a gooseneck bend and shall be located at a reasonable height above the weather deck, clear of all obstructions. No shut-off valve or frangible disk shall be fitted in the vent lines except that a float check valve may be installed so as to exclude the entry of water into the tank (i.e., to prevent downflooding). An open venting system may be fitted with a flame screen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure-vacuum venting. A normally closed venting system fitted with a device to automatically limit the pressure or vacuum in the tank to design limits. Pressure-vacuum relief valves shall comply with the requirements of subpart 162.017 of this chapter. The required capacity of the venting system shall be in accordance with part 54 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safety relief venting. A closed venting system fitted with a device to automatically limit the pressure in the tank to below its maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum safety relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. For cargoes carried at ambient temperatures, the minimum safety relief valve setting shall correspond to the saturated vapor pressure of the cargo at 105 [deg]F if carried in an insulated tank, or 115 [deg]F if carried in an uninsulated tank. For cargoes carried below ambient temperature, the safety relief valve setting shall be selected to provide a suitable margin between normal operating pressure of the tank and the opening pressure of the valve but in no case shall it exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. The safety relief valves shall be of a type approved under subparts 162.001 or 162.018 of subchapter Q of this chapter. The required capacity of the safety relief valves shall be in accordance with the requirements of part 54 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rupture disks. (1) When required by the nature of the cargo, rupture disks may be installed in lieu of or in addition to other pressure limiting devices in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  54.15-13 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When required by the nature of the cargo, rupture disks may be installed in lieu of or in addition to other pressure limiting devices in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  54.15-13 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a pressure-vacuum relief valve or safety relief valve normally protected by a rupture disk or breaking pin device is exposed to the cargo due to breakage of the disk, the valve shall be reinspected before being returned to service.</p>
