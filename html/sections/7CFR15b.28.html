Each recipient to which this section applies is also subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 15b.23 and 15b.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A recipient to which this section applies may not charge more for the provision of an appropriate education to handicapped persons than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient.
