                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to Sec. Sec. 1254.26(d) and 1254.86, you may use  scanners and other copying equipment if the equipment meets certain  conditions or minimum standards described in paragraphs (b) through (g)  of this section. Exceptions are noted in paragraph (h). The supervisor  administering the research room or the senior staff member on duty in  the research room reviews the research room attendant's determination if  you request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equipment platens or copy boards must be the same size or larger  than the records. No part of a record may overhang the platen or copy  board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No part of the equipment may come in contact with records in a  manner that causes friction, abrasion, or that otherwise crushes or  damages records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We prohibit drum scanners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We prohibit automatic feeder devices on flatbed scanners. When  using a slide scanner, we must check slides after scanning to ensure  that no damage occurs while the slide is inside the scanner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Light sources must not raise the surface temperature of the  record you copy. You must filter light sources that generate ultraviolet  light.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All equipment surfaces must be clean and dry before you use  records. You may not clean or maintain equipment, such as replacing  toner cartridges, when records are present. We do not permit aerosols or  ammonia-containing cleaning solutions. We permit a 50 percent water and  50 percent isopropyl alcohol solution for cleaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you wish to use a scanner or other personal copier in a  regional archives or Presidential library, contact the facility first  for approval. Not all facilities permit the use of scanners or personal  copying equipment because of space, electrical load concerns, and other  reasons. Your request must state the space and power consumption  requirements and the intended period of use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> In facilities that provide a self-service copier or permit the  use of personal paper-to-paper copiers or scanners, you must show  documents you wish to copy to the research room attendant for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If you have any question about what is permissible at any given  facility, consult with the facility before your visit. Contact  information for our facilities is found in part 1253 of this chapter and  at the NARA Web site, http://www.archives.gov.</p>
