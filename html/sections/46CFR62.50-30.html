                                Sec. 62.50-30  Additional requirements for periodically unattended
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Note: Periodically unattended machinery plants include machinery plants and spaces that are automated to the degree that they are self-regulating and self-monitoring and could safely be left periodically unattended. Emphasis is placed on providing systems that act automatically until the crew can take action in the event of a failure or emergency. Requirements are in addition to those of a minimally attended machinery plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The requirements of this section must be met in addition to those of Sec. 62.50-20 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automatic transfer. Redundant vital auxiliaries and power sources must automatically transfer to the backup units upon failure of operating units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuel systems. Each system for the service or treatment of fuel must meet section 4-6-4/13.5 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 62.05-1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Starting systems. Automatic or remote starting system receivers, accumulators, and batteries must be automatically and continuously charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assistance-needed alarm. The engineer's assistance-needed alarm (see subpart 113.27 of this chapter) must annunciate if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An alarm at the ECC is not acknowledged in the period of time necessary for an engineer to respond at the ECC from the machinery spaces or engineers' accommodations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An ECC alarm system normal power supply fails.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Remote alarms. ECC alarms for vital systems that require the immediate attention of the bridge watch officer for the safe navigation of the vessel must be extended to the bridge. All ECC alarms required by this part must be extended to the engineers' accommodations. Other than fire or flooding alarms, this may be accomplished by summarized visual alarm displays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> ECC alarms. All requirements of this part for system or equipment monitoring must be met by providing both displays and alarms at the ECC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fire control station. A control station for fire protection of the machinery spaces must be provided outside the machinery spaces. At least one access to this station must be independent of category A machinery spaces, and any boundary shared with these spaces must have an A-60 fire classification as defined in Sec. 72.05 of this chapter. Except where such an arrangement is not possible, control and monitoring cables and piping for the

station must not adjoin or penetrate the boundaries of a category A machinery space, uptakes, or casings. The fire control station must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annunciation of which machinery space is on fire;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control of a fire pump required by this chapter to be independent of the main machinery spaces;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Controls for machinery space fixed gas fire extinguishing systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control of oil piping positive shutoff valves located in the machinery spaces and required by Sec. 56.50-60(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Controls for machinery space fire door holding and release systems, skylights and similar openings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The remote stopping systems for the machinery listed in Sec. 111.103 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Voice communications with the bridge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Oil leakage. Leakages from high pressure fuel oil pipes must be collected and high levels must be alarmed at the ECC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Maintenance program. The maintenance program of Sec. 62.50-20(h) must include a checkoff list to make sure that routine daily maintenance has been performed, fire and flooding hazards have been minimized, and plant status is suitable for unattended operation. Completion of this checkoff list must be logged before leaving the plant unattended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Continuity of electrical power. The electrical plant must meet sections 4-8-2/3.11 and 4.8.2/9.9 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules, and must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not use the emergency generator for this purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restore power in not more than 30 seconds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Account for loads permitted by Sec. 111.70-3(f) of this chapter to automatically restart.
