Each nonhuman primate  that is less than 1 year of age must be offered food at least once every  12 hours. Each nonhuman primate must be offered potable water at least  once every 12 hours. These time periods apply to dealers, exhibitors,  and research facilities, including Federal research facilities, who  transport nonhuman primates in their own primary conveyances, starting  from the time the nonhuman primate was last offered food and potable  water before transportation was begun. These time periods apply to  carriers and intermediate handlers starting from the date and time  stated on the certification provided under Sec. 3.86(c) of this  subpart. Each nonhuman primate must be offered food and potable water  within 4 hours before being transported in commerce. Consignors who are  subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) must  certify that each nonhuman primate was offered food and potable water  within the 4 hours preceding delivery of the nonhuman primate to a  carrier or intermediate handler for transportation in commerce, and must  certify the date and time the food and potable water was offered, in  accordance with Sec. 3.86(c) of this subpart. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\5\ Proper food for purposes of this section is described in Sec.  3.82 of this subpart, with the necessities and circumstances of the mode  of travel taken into account. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any dealer, exhibitor, or research facility, including a Federal  research facility, offering a nonhuman primate to a carrier or  intermediate handler for transportation in commerce must securely attach  to the outside of the primary enclosure used for transporting the  nonhuman primate, written instructions for a 24-hour period for the in- transit food and water requirements of the nonhuman primate(s) contained  in the enclosure.
