                            <p class="depth0">Related personal property may, at the disposal agency's discretion,  be designated as personal property for disposal purposes. However, for  fine artwork and sculptures, GSA's policy is that artwork specifically  created for a Federal building is considered as a fixture of the  building. This also applies to sculptures created for a Federal building  or a public park. Disposal agencies must follow the policies and  guidance for disposal of artwork and sculptures developed by the GSA  Office of the Chief Architect, Center for Design Excellence and the  Arts, and the Bulletin dated March 26, 1934, entitled ``Legal Title to  Works Produced under the Public Works of Art Project.''</p>
