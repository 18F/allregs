                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An accrediting entity may charge fees for accreditation or approval services under this part only in accordance with a schedule of fees approved by the Secretary. Before approving a schedule of fees proposed by an accrediting entity, or subsequent proposed changes to an approved schedule, the Secretary will require the accrediting entity to demonstrate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That its proposed schedule of fees reflects appropriate consideration of the relative size and geographic location and volume of intercountry adopton cases of the agencies or persons it expects to serve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the total fees the accrediting entity expects to collect under the schedule of fees will not exceed the full costs of accreditation or approval

under this part (including, but not limited to, costs for completing the accreditation or approval process, complaint review and investigation, routine oversight and enforcement, and other data collection and reporting activities).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The schedule of fees must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establish separate non-refundable fees for accreditation and approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include in each fee for accreditation or approval the costs of all activities associated with the accreditation or approval cycle, including but not limited to, costs for completing the accreditation or approval process, complaint review and investigation, routine oversight and enforcement, and other data collection and reporting activities, except that separate fees based on actual costs incurred may be charged for the travel and maintenance of evaluators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An accrediting entity must make its approved schedule of fees available to the public, including prospective applicants for accreditation or approval, upon request. At the time of application, the accrediting entity must specify the fees to be charged to the applicant in a contract between the parties and must provide notice to the applicant that no portion of the fee will be refunded if the applicant fails to become accredited or approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to provide a private right of action to challenge any fee charged by an accrediting entity pursuant to a schedule of fees approved by the Secretary.
