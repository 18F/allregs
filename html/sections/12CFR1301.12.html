                                Sec. 1301.12  Fees for processing requests for Council records.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Council shall charge the requester for  processing a request under the FOIA in the amounts and for the services  set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except if a  waiver or reduction of fees   is granted under paragraph (f) of this section, or if, pursuant to  paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the failure of the Council to comply  with certain time limits precludes it from assessing certain fees. No  fees shall be charged if the amount of fees incurred in processing the  request is below $25.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Duplicating records. The Council shall charge a requester fees  for the cost of copying records as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $.15 per page, up to 8\1/2\ x 14, made by photocopy  or similar process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Photographs, films, and other materials--actual cost of  duplication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other types of duplication services not mentioned above-- actual cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Material provided to a private contractor for copying shall be  charged to the requester at the actual cost charged by the private  contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search services. The Council shall charge a requester for all  time spent by its employees searching for records that are responsive to  a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of  responsive information within records, even if no responsive records are  found. The Council shall charge the requester fees for search time as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Searches for other than electronic records. The Council shall  charge for search time at the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus sixteen  (16) percent) of the employee(s) who conduct the search. This charge  shall also include transportation of employees and records at actual  cost. Fees may be charged for search time even if the search does not  yield any responsive records, or if records are exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Searches for electronic records. The Council shall charge the  requester for the actual direct cost of the search, including computer  search time, runs, and the operator's salary. The fee for computer  output shall be the actual direct cost. For a requester in the ``other''  category, when the cost of the search (including the operator time and  the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the  equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person  performing the search (i.e., the operator), the charge for the computer  search will begin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review of records. The Council shall charge a requester for time  spent by its employees examining responsive records to determine whether  any portions of such record are withholdable from disclosure, pursuant  to the FOIA exemptions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The Council shall also charge  a requester for time spent by its employees redacting any such  withholdable information from a record and preparing a record for  release to the requester. The Council shall charge a requester for time  spent reviewing records at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus  sixteen (16) percent) of the employees who conduct the review. Fees may  be charged for review time even if records ultimately are not disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inspection of records in the reading room. Fees for all services  provided shall be charged whether or not copies are made available to  the requester for inspection. However, no fee shall be charged for  monitoring a requester's inspection of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other services. Other services and materials requested which are  not covered by this part nor required by the FOIA are chargeable at the  actual cost to the Council. Charges permitted under this paragraph may  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certifying that records are true copies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sending records by special methods (such as by express mail,  etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees applicable to various categories of requesters-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Generally. The Council shall assess the fees set forth in paragraph (b)  of this section in accordance with the requester fee categories set  forth below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requester selection of fee category. A requester shall identify,  in the initial FOIA request, the purpose of the request in one of the  following categories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial. A commercial use request refers to a request from or  on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that  furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or  the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include  furthering those interests through litigation. The Council may determine  from the use specified in the   request that the requester is a commercial user.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Educational institution. This refers to a preschool, a public  or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an  institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational  education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.  This category does not include requesters seeking records for use in  meeting individual academic research or study requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-commercial scientific institution. This refers to an  institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as that term  is defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and which is operated  solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of  which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>, the term ``news'' means information that is about  current events or that would be of current interest to the public.  Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations  broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but  only if such entities qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make  their products available for purchase by subscription or by free  distribution to the general public. These examples are not all- inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example,  the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through  telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered  to be news media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as  working for a news media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a  solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or  not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication  contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the  Council may also consider the past publication record of the requester  in making such a determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other Requester. This refers to a requester who does not fall  within any of the categories described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)-(iv) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees applicable to each category of requester. The Council shall  apply the fees set forth in this paragraph, for each category described  in paragraph (c) of this section, to requests processed by the Council  under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use. A requester seeking records for commercial use  shall be charged the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and  duplicating the records they request as set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section. Moreover, when a request is received for disclosure that  is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Council is  not required to consider a request for a waiver or reduction of fees  based upon the assertion that disclosure would be in the public  interest. The Council may recover the cost of searching for and  reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records  or no records are located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational and non-commercial scientific uses. A requester  seeking records for educational or non-commercial scientific use shall  be charged only for the cost of duplicating the records they request,  except that the Council shall provide the first one hundred (100) pages  of duplication free of charge. To be eligible, the requester must show  that the request is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution  and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought  in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational  institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial  scientific institution) research. These categories do not include a  requester who seeks records for use in meeting individual academic  research or study requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> News media uses. A requester seeking records under the news  media use category shall be charged only for the cost of duplicating the  records they request, except that the Council shall provide the  requester with the first one hundred (100) pages of duplication free of  charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other requests. A requester seeking records for any other use  shall be charged the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating  records that are responsive to the request, as set forth in paragraph  (b) of this section, except that the Council shall provide the first one  hundred (100) pages of duplication and the first two hours of search  time free of charge. The Council may recover the cost of searching for  records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, or no  records are located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other circumstances when fees are not charged. Notwithstanding  paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Council may not charge  a requester a fee for processing a FOIA request if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Services were performed without charge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than  the fee itself;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fees were waived or reduced in accordance with paragraph (f)  of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Council fails to comply with any time limit under Sec.  1301.7 or Sec. 1301.11, and no unusual circumstances (as that term is  defined in Sec. 1301.7(e)) or exceptional circumstances apply to the  processing of the request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The requester is an educational or noncommercial scientific  institution or a representative of the news media (as described in  paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section), then the Council  shall not assess the duplication fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A requester shall be entitled  to receive from the Council a waiver or reduction in the fees otherwise  applicable to a FOIA request whenever the requester:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requests such waiver or reduction of fees in writing and submits  the written request to the Council together with or as part of the FOIA  request, or at a later time consistent with Sec. 1301.5(b)(7) to  process the request; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrates that the fee reduction or waiver request is in the  public interest because:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Furnishing the information is likely to contribute significantly  to public understanding of the operations or activities of the  government; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Furnishing the information is not primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine whether the requester has satisfied the  requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the Council  shall consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable  operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection  that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disclosable portions of the requested records must be  meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in  order to be ``likely to contribute'' to an increased public  understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of  information that already is in the public domain, in either a  duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to  contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the  public's understanding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a  reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as  opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's  expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively  convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be  presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The public's understanding of the subject in question, as  compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the  disclosure, must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine whether the requester satisfies the requirement of  paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the Council shall consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i))</em>, or of any  person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be  furthered by the requested disclosure. In the administrative process, a  requester may provide explanatory information regarding this  consideration; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the public interest is greater in magnitude than that  of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Council  ordinarily shall presume that, if a news media requester satisfies the  public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest  primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data  brokers or others who merely compile and market government information  for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the  public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the  requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction  shall be granted for those records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determination of request to reduce or waive fees. The Council  shall notify the requester in writing regarding its determinations to  reduce or waive fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Effect of denying request to reduce or waive fees. If the  Council denies a request to reduce or waive fees, then the Council shall  advise the requester, in the denial notification letter, that the  requester may incur fees as a result of processing the request. In the  denial notification letter, the Council shall advise the requester that  the Council will not proceed to process the request further unless the  requester, in writing, directs the Council to do so and either agrees to  pay any fees that may apply to processing the request or specifies an  upper limit (of not less than $25) that the requester is willing to pay  to process the request. If the Council does not receive this written  direction and agreement/specification within thirty (30) days of the  date of the denial notification letter, then the Council shall deem the  FOIA request to be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Appeals of denials of requests to reduce or waive fees. If the  Council denies a request to reduce or waive fees, then the requester  shall have the right to submit an appeal of the denial determination in  accordance with Sec. 1301.11. The Council shall communicate this appeal  right as part of its written notification to the requester denying the  fee reduction or waiver request. The requester shall clearly mark its  appeal request and any envelope that encloses it with the words ``Appeal  for Fee Reduction/Waiver.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of estimated fees; advance payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Council  estimates the fees for processing a request will exceed the limit set by  the requester, and that amount is less than $250, the Council shall  notify the requester of the estimated costs, broken down by search,  review and duplication fees. The requester must provide an agreement to  pay the estimated costs, except that the requester may reformulate the  request in an attempt to reduce the estimated fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the requester fails to state a limit and the costs are  estimated to exceed $250, the requester shall be notified of the  estimated costs, broken down by search, review and duplication fees, and  must pay such amount prior to the processing of the request, or provide  satisfactory assurance of full payment if the requester has a history of  prompt payment of FOIA fees. Alternatively, the requester may  reformulate the request in such a way as to constitute a request for  responsive records at a reduced fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Council reserves the right to request advance payment after  a request is processed and before records are released.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a requester previously has failed to pay a fee within thirty  (30) calendar days of the date of the billing, the requester shall be  required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and  to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee  before the Council begins to process a new request or the pending  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the Council acts under paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of  this section, the administrative time limits of twenty (20) days  (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from receipt  of initial requests or appeals, plus extensions of these time limits,  shall begin only after any applicable fees have been paid (in the case  of paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), or (g)(4)), a written agreement to pay  fees has been provided (in the case of paragraph (g)(1)), or a request  has been reformulated (in the case of paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Form of payment. Payment may be made by check or money order  paid to the Treasurer of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Charging interest. The Council may charge interest on any unpaid  bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the  requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31  U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment  is received by the Council. The Council will follow the provisions of  the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as  amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of  consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Aggregating requests. If the Council reasonably determines that  a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to  divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding  fees, the Council may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.  The Council may presume that multiple requests involving related matters  submitted within a thirty (30) calendar day period have been made in  order to avoid fees. The Council shall not aggregate multiple requests  involving unrelated matters.</p>
