                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The granting of an exploration license or lease for the exploration, development, or production of deposits of oil shale does not preclude the BLM from issuing other exploration licenses or leases for the same lands for deposits of other minerals. Each exploration license or lease reserves the right to allow any other uses or to allow disposal of the leased lands if it does not unreasonably interfere with the exploration and mining operations of the lessee. The lessee or the licensee must make all reasonable efforts to avoid interference with other such authorized uses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsequent lessee or licensee will be required to conduct operations in a manner that will not interfere with the established rights of existing lessees or licensees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the BLM issues an oil shale lease, it will cancel all oil shale exploration licenses for the leased lands.</p>
