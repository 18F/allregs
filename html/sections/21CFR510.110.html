                                Sec. 510.110  Antibiotics used in food-producing animals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Food and Drug Administration in the interest of fulfilling  its responsibilities with regard to protection of the public health has  requested an evaluation of the public health aspects of the use of  antibiotics in veterinary medical and nonmedical uses. There is  particular concern with regard to the potential hazards associated with  the extensive use of antibiotics administered to food-producing animals.  Accordingly, an ad hoc committee on the Veterinary Medical and  Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics was established by the Food and Drug  Administration to study and advise the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on  the uses of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various  nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to their safety and  effectiveness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Based upon an evaluation of the conclusions of said Committee  and other relevant material, Sec. 510.112 was published in the Federal  Register of August 23, 1966 (31 FR 11141), asking sponsors of drugs  containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals to  submit data to establish whether such antibiotic and its metabolites are  present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated  animals. The data on the residues of antibiotics in milk from  intramammary infusion preparations were requested within 60 days and the  data on all other products were requested within 180 days following the  date of publication of Sec. 510.112 in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An evaluation of the data now available shows that use of many  antibiotic preparations cause residues in edible products of treated  animals for varying and, in some cases, for long periods of time  following the last administration. Because of the accumulation of new  information with regard to the development of resistance of bacteria to  antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to transfer this resistance, and  the development of sensitivity to antibiotics in humans, unauthorized  and unsafe residues of antibiotics cannot be permitted in food obtained  from treated animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Based on evaluation of information available, including the  conclusions of the aforementioned ad hoc Committee, the Commissioner  concludes that antibiotic preparations intended for use in food- producing animals, other than topical and ophthalmic preparations, are  not generally recognized among qualified experts as having been shown to  be safe for their intended use(s) within the meaning of section 201(s)  of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Therefore, all exemptions from the provisions of section 409 of  the act for use of antibiotics in food-producing animals based on  sanctions or approvals granted prior to enactment of the Food Additives  Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929; 72 Stat. 1784) will be revoked and  the uses which are concluded to be safe will be covered by food additive  regulations. On those products for which there are inadequate residue  data, actions will be initiated to withdraw approval of new-drug  applications under the provisions of section 505 of the act. Antibiotic  preparations, other than those for topical and ophthalmic application in  food-producing animals, which are not covered by food additive  regulations will be subject to regulatory action within 180 days after  publication of the forthcoming revocation order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Because of the variation in the period of time that antibiotic  residues may remain in edible products from treated animals, all  injectable, intramammary infusion, intrauterine, and oral preparations,  including medicated premixes intended for use in food-producing animals,  are deemed to be new drugs as well as food additives.  [40 FR 13807, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 54 FR 18280, Apr. 28, 1989;  64 FR 403, Jan. 5, 1999]</p>
