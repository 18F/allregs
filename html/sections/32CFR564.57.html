Sec. 564.51 to 564.68 and of accidents or incidents which may give  rise to such claims rests in the adjutants general of the several  States. Accordingly, claims received by the National Guard Bureau, or  other agencies of the United States, will be referred to the adjutants  general of the interested States. Regulations promulgated by the State  adjutants general should require the prompt investigation of all  accidents or incidents which might result in claims cognizable  hereunder, whether or not claims have been filed.</p>
