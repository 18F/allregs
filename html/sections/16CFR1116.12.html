                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a section 37 report, the Commission will evaluate  the information contained in the report and any relevant information  contained in its files or data bases to determine what, if any, follow- up or remedial action by the Commission is appropriate. If the  Commission requires additional information, it will notify the  manufacturer in writing of the specific information to provide. In  addition, the Commission will routinely review section 37 reports to  determine whether the reporting manufacturers have fulfilled their  obligations under both sections 37 and 15(b) in a timely manner. Such a  review may also engender a request for additional information, including  the dates on which final orders were entered in each of the lawsuits  reported under section 37. The Commission will treat any subsequent  submission of information by the manufacturer as a submission under  section 37(c)(2)(B) subject to the restrictions on public disclosure  contained in sections 6(a) and (b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.</p>
