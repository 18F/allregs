                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(F)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of hearing. If the Secretary of Agriculture determines  that such a hearing shall be held, he shall issue a notice of the  hearing, which shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the United  States Department of Agriculture, who shall promptly (1) cause such  notice to be published in the Federal Register, and (2) mail a copy  thereof to each of the producers who requested the hearing and to grower  organizations known to be interested in the hearing. Legal notice of the  hearing shall be deemed to be given upon filing such notice with the  Federal Register for publication, and failure to give notice in the  manner otherwise provided in this paragraph shall not affect the  legality of the notice. The notice of hearing shall state the purpose of  the hearing and the time and place of the hearing. The time of the  hearing shall not be less than fifteen days after the date of  publication of the notice in the Federal Register, unless the Secretary  shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period  of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the  Secretary determines to be reasonable in the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conduct of hearing--(1) Presiding officer. Each hearing held  under section 301(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(F)</em> shall be presided over by a Hearing Examiner  of the Office of Administrative Law Judges or such other employee of the  Department as the Secretary may designate for the purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time and place of hearing. Each hearing shall be heard at the  time and place set forth in the notice of hearing but may be continued  by the presiding officer from day to day or adjourned to a later date or  to a different place without notice other than the announcement thereof  at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Order of procedure. At the commencement of the hearing, the  presiding officer shall file as an exhibit a copy of the Federal  Register containing the notice of the hearing and shall then outline  briefly the procedure to be followed. Evidence shall then be received  from interested persons in such order as the presiding officer shall  prescribe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submission of evidence. The hearing shall be conducted in such a  way as to obtain a clear and orderly record. All interested persons  appearing at the hearing shall be given reasonable opportunity to offer  data, views, or arguments relevant to (i) whether the parity price for  the agricultural commodity involved is or is not seriously out of line  with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, and (ii) the  proper relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the  parity prices of other agricultural commodities and the revisions, if  any, which should be made in computing the parity price of such  commodity. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in duplicate. The  presiding officer shall, insofar as possible, exclude irrelevant,  immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall not apply technical  judicial rules of evidence. Every witness shall be subject to  questioning by the presiding officer or by any other representative of  the Department, but cross-examination by other persons shall not be  allowed, except in the discretion of the presiding officer. The  proceedings at the hearing shall be transcribed verbatim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Written arguments. The presiding officer shall fix a time, not  to exceed ten days from the close of the hearing, within which  interested persons may file written arguments with the Hearing Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preparation and issuance of determination--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preparation of  recommendation. As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing,  the presiding officer, or such employees of the Department as may be  assigned for the purpose, shall review, consider, and weigh all evidence  of probative value, views, and arguments which have been submitted, and  may consider other pertinent information and data which is available in  the Department of Agriculture, and shall submit a recommendation thereon  to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination by the Secretary. As soon as possible after  receipt of the recommendation, the Secretary shall determine whether the  parity price of such commodity computed in accordance with section  301(a)(1) appears to be seriously out of line with the parity prices of  other agricultural commodities whether the facts require a revision of  the method of computing the parity price of such commodity, and the  revision, if any, which is required in the method of computing the  parity price of such commodity. Such determination by the Secretary  shall be final. The Secretary's determination shall be filed with the  Hearing Clerk who shall cause the determination to be published promptly  in the Federal Register. The Hearing Clerk shall also mail a copy of the  determination to each producer and grower organization which  participated in or is known to be interested in the hearing. Upon  application to the Hearing Clerk, any person shall be entitled to a copy  of the determination.  [23 FR 9252, Nov. 29, 1958]</p>
