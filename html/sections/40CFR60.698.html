Thereafter, the owner or  operator shall submit to the Administrator semiannually a certification  that all of the required inspections have been carried out in accordance  with these standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a flare  shall submit to the Administrator within 60 days after initial startup,  as required under Sec. 60.8(a), a report of the results of the  performance test required in Sec. 60.696(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A report that summarizes all inspections when a water seal was  dry or otherwise breached, when a drain cap or plug was missing or  improperly installed, or when cracks, gaps, or other problems were  identified that could result in VOC emissions, including information  about the repairs or corrective action taken, shall be submitted  initially and semiannually thereafter to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As applicable, a report shall be submitted semiannually to the  Administrator that indicates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average  temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone of a thermal  incinerator, as measured by the temperature monitoring device, is more  than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) below the design combustion zone temperature,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average  temperature of the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed of a  catalytic incinerator, as measured by the temperature monitoring device,  is more than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) below the design gas stream  temperature, and any 3-hour period during which the average temperature  difference across the catalyst bed (i.e., the difference between the  temperatures of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst  bed), as   measured by the temperature monitoring device, is less than 80 percent  of the design temperature difference, or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average VOC  concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases from a  carbon adsorber is more than 20 percent greater than the design exhaust  gas concentration level or reading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average  volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of organics in  the exhaust gases from a carbon adsorber which is regenerated directly  onsite is more than 20 percent greater than the design exhaust gas  concentration level or reading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If compliance with the provisions of this subpart is delayed  pursuant to Sec. 60.692-7, the notification required under 40 CFR  60.7(a)(4) shall include the estimated date of the next scheduled  refinery or process unit shutdown after the date of notification and the  reason why compliance with the standards is technically impossible  without a refinery or process unit shutdown.
