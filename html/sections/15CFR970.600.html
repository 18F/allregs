                            <p class="depth0">Several provisions in the Act relate to appropriate mining techniques or mining efficiency. These raise what could be characterized as resource development issues. In particular, under section 103(a)(2)(D) of the Act, the applicant will select the size and location of the area of an exploration plan, which will be approved unless the Administrator finds that the area is not a ``logical mining unit.'' Also, pursuant to section 108 of the Act the applicant's exploration plan and the terms, conditions and restrictions of each license must be designed to ensure diligent development. In addition, for the purpose of conservation of natural resources,

section 110 of the Act provides that each license is to contain, but only as needed, terms, conditions, and restrictions which have due regard for the prevention of waste and the future opportunity for the commercial recovery of the unrecovered balance of the resources.</p>
