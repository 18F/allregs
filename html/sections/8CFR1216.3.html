                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the two-year conditional period. The director shall send  a formal written notice to the conditional permanent resident of the  termination of the alien's conditional permanent resident status if the  director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section  216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true,  or it becomes known to the government that an alien entrepreneur who was  admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her  investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the  sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a notice of intent to  terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not  adjudicate Form I-751 or Form I-829 until it has been determined that  the alien's status will not be terminated. During this time, the alien  shall continue to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all  the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to persons  possessing such status. Prior to issuing the notice of termination, the  director shall provide the alien with an opportunity to review and rebut  the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with  Sec. 103.2(b)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I. The termination of status, and all  of the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including  authorization to accept or continue in employment in this country),  shall take effect as of the date of such determination by   the director, although the alien may request a review of such  determination in removal proceedings. In addition to the notice of  termination, the director shall issue a notice to appear in accordance  with 8 CFR part 1239. During the ensuing removal proceedings, the alien  may submit evidence to rebut the determination of the director. The  burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance  of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions in section 216(b)(1)  or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or that an  alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the  Act obtained his or her investment capital through other than legal  means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of the Act, the director may  institute rescission proceedings pursuant to section 246 of the Act (if  otherwise appropriate) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the  Act.
