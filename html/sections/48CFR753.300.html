Sec. Appendix D to Chapter 7--Direct USAID Contracts With a U.S. Citizen</p><p class="depth0">or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a result of the contract's terms or the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-person services contract means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Independent contractor relationship means a contract relationship in which the

contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under this relationship, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Resident hire means a U.S. citizen who, at the time of hire as a PSC, resides in the cooperating country as a spouse or dependent of a U.S. citizen employed by a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement, or for reasons other than for employment with a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement. A U.S. citizen for purposes of this definition also includes persons who at the time of contracting are lawfully admitted permanent residents of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> U.S. resident alien means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Abroad means outside the United States and its territories and possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> USAID direct-hire employees means civilian employees appointed under USAID Handbook 25 procedures or superseding Automated Directive System (ADS) Chapters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the ``FAA'') provides the Agency's contracting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2396(a)(3)) authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals ``* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.'' \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This appendix does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nonpersonal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR (48 CFR Chapter 1) and the AIDAR (48 CFR chapter 7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal services contracts with individual Cooperating Country Nationals (CCNs) or Third Country Nationals (TCNs). Such contracts are covered by Appendix J of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other personal services arrangements covered by USAID Handbook 25--Employment and Promotion or superseding ADS Chapters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interagency agreements (e.g., PASAs and RSSAs covered by ADS 306--Interagency Agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services contracts as part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with an individual U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Program funds. Under the authority of Section 635(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operating Expense Funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years also but funded only as outlined in paragraph 4(a) of this appendix.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on Personal Services Contracts. (1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, U.S. citizen personal services contractors (USPSCs) may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility delegable to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:</p><p class="depth0">a. They may not supervise U.S. direct-hire employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.</p><p class="depth0">b. They may not be designated as Contracting Officers or delegated authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.</p><p class="depth0">c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.</p><p class="depth0">d. They may participate in personnel selection matters, but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.</p><p class="depth0">e. Exceptions to the limitations in this paragraph (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Withholdings and Fringe Benefits. (1) Personal services contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the ``foreign earned income'' exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal services contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the ``foreign earned income'' exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal services contractors are treated on par with other Government employees, except for programs based on any law administered by the Federal Office of Personnel Management (e.g., incentive awards, life insurance, health insurance, and retirement programs covered by 5 CFR Parts 530, 531, 831, 870, 871, and 890). While PSCs are ineligible to participate in any of these programs, the following fringe benefits are provided as a matter of policy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employer's FICA contribution for retirement purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A contribution against the actual cost of the PSC's annual health and life insurance costs. Proof of health and life insurance coverage and its actual cost to the PSC shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is made. (See also paragraph 4(c)(3) of this appendix.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contribution for health insurance shall not exceed 50% of the actual cost to the PSC for his/her annual health insurance, or the maximum U.S. Government contribution for a direct-hire employee, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is less. If the PSC is covered under a spouse's health insurance plan, where the spouse's employer pays some or all of the health insurance costs, the cost to the PSC for annual health insurance shall be considered to be zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contribution for life insurance shall be up to 50% of the actual annual costs to the PSC for life insurance, not to exceed $500.00 per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> PSCs shall receive a 3% annual salary increase subject to satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluation. Such increase may not exceed 3% without a deviation. This 3% limitation also applies to extensions of the same service or negotiations for a new contract for the same or similar services unless a deviation has been approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> PSCs shall receive the following allowances and differentials provided in the State Department's Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians Foreign Areas) on the same basis as U.S. Government employees (except for U.S. resident hires, see paragraph 4(d) and Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 22, ``U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors''):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Temporary lodging allowance (Section 120),\3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Mission Directors may authorize per diem in lieu of these allowances.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Living quarters allowance (Section 130),\3\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Post allowance (Section 220),\3\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Supplemental post allowance (Section 230),\3\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Separate maintenance allowance (Section 260),\4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ These allowances are not authorized for short tours (i.e., less than a year).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Education allowance (Section 270),\4\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Educational travel (Section 280),\4\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Post differential (Section 500),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Payments during evacuation/authorized departure (Section 600), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Danger pay (Section 650).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any allowance or differential that is not expressly stated in paragraph 4(c)(2)(v) is not authorized for any PSC unless a deviation is approved. The only exception is a consumables allowance if authorized for the post under Handbook 22 or superseding ADS Chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Health room services may be provided in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled ``Physical Fitness and Health Room Privileges.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> PSCs are eligible to receive benefits for injury, disability, or death under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act since the law is administered by the Department of Labor not the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> PSCs are eligible to earn four hours of annual leave and four hours of sick leave for each two week period. However, PSCs with previous PSC service (not previous U.S. Government civilian or military service) earn either six hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 3 years (including 10 hours annual leave for the final pay period of a calendar year), or eight hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 15 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraph 4(c)(2)(ii) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contract (since the Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree) unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/

her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. If coverage overseas is excluded, then eligibility as cited in paragraph 4(c)(3) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Retired U.S. Government employees may be awarded Personal Services Contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors. U.S. resident-hire PSCs are not eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance, and life insurance), including differentials and allowances unless such individuals can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that they have received similar benefits and allowances from their immediately previous employer in the cooperating country, or the Mission Director may determine that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the Mission's policy and practice and would be in the best interests of the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determining salary for personal services contractors. (1) There are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Method 1: Salaries for Personal Services Contractors shall be established based on the market value in the United States of the position being recruited for. This requires the Contracting Officer in coordination with the Technical Officer to determine the correct market value (a salary range) of the position to be filled. This method is required in establishing salary for all PSCs unless method 2 is authorized as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). Contract Information Bulletin (CIB) 96-8 dated February 23, 1996 provides a guide which contains information concerning Preparation of Scopes of Work, Determination of Salary Class Grade, Salary Class Bench Marks and Salary Class Review. The market value of the position then becomes the basis along with the applicants' certified salary history on the SF 171, ``Personal Qualifications Statement'' for salary negotiations by the Contracting Officer. The SF 171 must be retained in the permanent contract file. Any position which is determined to be above the GS-13 equivalent and exceeds six months in duration must be classified by M/HR/POD. The crucial point is the establishment of a realistic and reasonable market value for a job. The final determination regarding the reasonableness of a salary level rests with the Contracting Officer. Paying salaries using this method avoids ``rank in person'' salaries which are in excess of the value of the job being contracted for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2: If approved in writing by the Mission Director or the cognizant Assistant Administrator, based on written justification, salary may be negotiated based on the applicant's current earnings adjusted in accordance with the factors set out in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C). This approval requirement cannot be redelegated. Current earnings must be certified by the contractor on the SF 171, (see paragraph 6(b)(3) of this appendix). This is guidance for establishing initial salaries, not subsequent increases, for the same contractor performing the same function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> As a rule, up to a 3 percent increase above current earnings may be given. However, a 3 percent increase is awarded only to a PSC whose earnings are based on a period of twelve months or more; 2 percent for established earnings of less than twelve months but not less than four months; or 1 percent for established earnings during the past four months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional percentages may be given for the following factors. If a PSC has worked in a developing country for more than two years, an additional 1 percent may be awarded. Education related to the area of specialization and above the minimum qualification required may warrant an additional 1 percent, and those specialties for which there is keen competition in the employment market or a serious shortage category nationwide may be awarded an additional 2 percent. In addition, related technical experience over 5 years may increase the percentage by 1 and over ten years by 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All requests for an initial rate of pay above 10 percent over current earnings must be approved in writing by the appropriate Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. Current earnings are actual earnings for work reasonably related to the position for which the applicant is being considered. Paragraphs 4(e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C) apply only to salary setting method number 2 in paragraph 4 (e)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an applicant has no current earnings history (e.g., a person returning to the workforce after an absence of a number of years) or when an applicant's current earnings history doesn't accurately reflect the applicant's job market worth (e.g., a Peace Corps volunteer), every effort should be made to establish a market value for the position as a basis for negotiation, notwithstanding the lack of a current earnings history, provided that the applicant has the full qualifications for the job and could command a similar salary in the open job market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This appendix applies the ``USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)'' policy in Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302.3.6.8 to salaries for U.S. PSCs. Salaries in excess of the USAID CST, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, must be approved by the M/OAA Director in accordance with the approval procedures in ADS

302.3.6.8(e). This approval cannot be re-delegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Incentive awards. U.S. PSCs are not eligible to receive monetary awards. They are eligible for non-monetary awards such as certificates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Annual salary increase. PSC contracts written for more than one year should provide for a 3% annual increase based on satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Pay comparability adjustment. PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as that received by U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subcontracting. PSCs are U.S. Government employees and may not be called upon (or permitted) to subcontract out any part of their work. Funds for subcontracting have no place in the budget of a personal services contract. Support services, equipment, and supplies (e.g., typing and report preparation, paper, pens, computers, and furniture) should be furnished to PSCs just as they would be to direct-hire employees. To the extent that direct-hire personnel may be authorized to purchase supporting services or supplies under a travel authorization, so may PSCs; otherwise, contracts for personal services should not contain any funds for procurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical Officer's responsibilities. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for. The statement shall be included in the procurement request (the Acquisition & Assistance Request Document) e.g., the request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An estimate of what a comparable GS/FS equivalent position should cost, including basic salary, allowances, and differentials, if appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contracting Officer's responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Three sets of SF 171s and SF 171As. (Upon receipt, one copy of each SF 171 and SF 171A shall be forwarded to the Project Officer.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, General Provisions as appropriate, as well as the FAR Clauses to be incorporated in full text and by reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of the USAID General Notice entitled ``Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) except those recruited from the U.S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Competition. (1) Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.) are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.) are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> PSCs with Untied States citizens or resident aliens recruited from outside the cooperating country. Solicitations for PSCs recruited outside the cooperating country must be publicized via the Agency's External Home Page on the Internet under the caption ``Business & Procurement, USAID Procurements.'' Instructions regarding how to access the External Internet and the information to be provided have been approved and included in a CIB. A justification under FAR 6.303 is not required when this procedure is followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. This class justification for Personal Services Contracts with U.S. Citizens may only be used for those who are recruited locally subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The position was publicized locally in accordance with established Mission policy or procedure, or the procedures in paragraph 5(c)(ii) was followed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs 5(c) (i) and (ii), at least 3 individuals were considered by consulting source lists (e.g., applications or resumes on hand) or conducting other informal solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Extensions or renewals with the same individual for continuing services do not need to be publicized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to (48 CFR) AIDAR

706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the appropriate competitive procedure in paragraph 5(3) is not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Since the award of a Personal Services Contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the SF 171, ``Personal Qualifications Statement'', and SF 171A, ``Continuation Sheet for Standard Form 171'', are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR subparts 15.4 and 15.5 and FAR parts 52 and 53 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall govern.</p><p class="depth0">6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection procedures are more akin to the personnel selection procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical Officer's responsibilities. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications (i.e., SF 171s) received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contracting Officer's responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. Normally, the Contracting Officer shall negotiate only the salary (see the salary setting coverage in paragraph 4(e) of this Appendix). The terms and conditions of the contract, including differentials and allowances, are not negotiable or waivable without a properly approved deviation (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470). If the Contracting Officer can negotiate a salary that is fair and reasonable, then the award shall be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the SF 171 as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the market value of the position being recruited for (unless approval not to use market value has been granted under paragraph 4(e)(1)(ii)), and the Technical Officer's cost estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contracting Officer will obtain two copies of IRS Form W-4, ``Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate'', from the successful applicant. (Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will forward one copy of the W-4 to the Office of the Controller.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Security clearance is required for all U.S. citizens entering into USAID PSCs. The Contracting Officer will obtain four sets of SF 86, ``Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position'', from the successful applicant and forward them to the Office of Security. PSCs may receive a preliminary clearance and be placed under contract prior to receipt of clearance provided the appropriate paper work has been completed, reviewed by IG/SEC/PSI and acknowledged as a ``no objection'' to the appropriate Mission. See General Provision 24 in section 12 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">7. Executing a Personal Services Contract.

Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Temporary lodging allowance.

Supplemental post allowance is a form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary subsistence costs. The contractor will receive supplemental post allowance payments not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payments during evacuation.

If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director, the contractor will receive payments during evacuation for himself/herself and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Educational allowance.

Danger pay allowance is an allowance to provide additional compensation above basic compensation to employees in foreign areas where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu

of that part of the post differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence. The contractor shall be allowed danger pay allowance not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Educational travel. Educational travel is travel to and from a school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an educational allowance) and for college education. The contractor will receive educational travel payments for his/her dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for contractors whose assignment is less than two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The allowances provided in paragraphs (a) (1) through (10) of this provision shall be paid to the contractor in dollars or in the currency of the Cooperating Country in accordance with practice prevailing at the Mission, or the Mission Director may direct that the contractor be paid a per diem in lieu thereof as prescribed by the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), as from time to time amended.

Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for its direct-hire employees and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If the contract is for longer than one year and the contractor does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty for the contractor and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder.

One stopover enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler.

carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion of travel accomplished by the United States-flag carriers will be reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Limitation on travel by dependents.

Sec. Appendix F to Chapter 7--Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for</p><p class="depth0">Title XII Activities</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This appendix provides a detailed description of the collaborative assistance method of contracting. This is a specialized contracting system which may be used for contracting with educational institutions eligible under, and for activities authorized under, Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, under the circumstances described in AIDAR 715.613-71.</p><p class="depth0">2. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">The collaborative assistance system is designed to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Increase the joint implementation authority and responsibility of the contractor and the LDC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Encourage more effective collaboration between all participating parties (USAID, host country, and contractor) at important stages, including the design stage of a technical assistance project.</p><p class="depth0">3. Policy</p><p class="depth0">The collaborative assistance approach represents an alternative method for long-term technical assistance which involves professional collaboration with eligible Title XII institutions and LDC counterparts for a problem-solving type activity to develop new institutional forms and capabilities, to devise operating systems and policies, and to conduct joint research and development--including training. In such an activity, the difficulty in defining, in advance, precise and objectively verifiable contractor inputs and long-term project content as a basis for payment usually requires a flexible approach to project design, contracting, and project implementation. Such flexibility is also essential to the collaborative style which is responsive to LDC desires in problem areas of great complexity and varying uncertainty. Other types of technical assistance, which are usually shorter in term are amenable to

more precise definition in advance, or involve closely defined and relatively standardized services, or are otherwise more analogous to commodity resource transfers, may be suitable for other contracting methods, e.g., certain forms of institution building, on-the-job training, resource surveys, etc. The collaborative assistance method is an approved method for providing technical assistance when used in accordance with the circumstances outlined above, and with the guidelines set forth in paragraph 4, below.</p><p class="depth0">4. Implementation Procedures</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This paragraph 4, provides background information, guidelines and procedures to effect the implementation of the policy set forth in paragraph 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions and practices. In order for this policy to work effectively even when the proposed activity fits the criteria described under Policy, there must also be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acceptance of the notion that the host country, in consultation with the contractor, is in the best position to make tactical, day-to-day decisions on project inputs within agreed-upon limitations and output expectations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sufficient trust and respect between the Agency and the contractor to allow this flexible implementation authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A direct-hire project monitor with appropriate background to be knowledgeable of progress and to assist in an advisory and facilitative capacity, both during and between periodic reviews. In addition, the following important conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adequate preproject communication between, and identification of assistance required by, the host government and USAID;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Full joint planning and improved project design (``Joint'' as used herein refers to the primary parties, i.e., the collaborating institutions, as well as the host government and USAID. In some instances, it can also include other donors.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Careful contractor selection, i.e., matching of the contractor's technical and managerial capabilities to the anticipated requirements of the overseas activity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Establishment of relationships between host country, USAID and contractor staff to include host country leadership, flexible implementation authority, and effective management by the contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Improved joint project evaluation, feedback, and replanning; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Simplified administrative procedures and greater reliance on in-country logistical support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Project Stages and Contractor Involvement. In the long-term technical assistance projects as described above, there are four discrete but sometimes overlapping decision stages which take place--with the principal contractor usually involved in the last three.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Problem analysis and project identification. After the host government has indicated a desire for U.S. collaboration on a particular problem and the USAID field mission has determined that the proposed activity is consistent with its program goals and priorities, considerable effort is usually necessary to refine further the project purpose and type of assistance required and provide a basis for contractor selection. This is a crucial step and is focused on results sought--on what the prospective contractor is expected to produce in relation to resources to be used and to project purpose. It should result in a clear understanding of what the LDC wants, and an overall plan which includes agreement on specific objectives or outputs, acceptable types of activities and inputs and an initial budget--resulting in project documentation. At this step, USAID makes decisions it cannot delegate on what it will support and at what cost. If needed to supplement its direct-hire expertise, USAID can use outside consultants for analysis and advice but retains the ultimate decision for itself in collaboration with, but independent of, the requesting host government. (Normally, the proposed contractor for project definition and subsequent implementation should not have been involved in the problem analysis and project identification stage as a consultant to either the host country government, host institution, or USAID. If a potential contractor has been so involved, particular care must be taken to prevent actual or apparent organizational conflicts of interest in the procurement that follows. This could require at a minimum, a careful assessment and complete documentation of reasons for selection.)</p><p class="depth0">Normally, there will need to be some mutual interaction between the overall planning stage outlined here and the detailed planning and design work which follows in the next phase. There will usually be some overlap, with preliminary decisions in this stage providing a basis for selection of implementing agents for stage (2) which in turn proceeds through some preliminary planning to guide completion of stage (1) as a basis for long-term contracting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Project definition. At this stage, having selected the implementing agent, the U.S. and LDC organizations which will be collaborating in carrying out the project are encouraged to work out, to their mutual \3/8\satisfaction, the particulars of what to do and how to do it (i.e., detailed project design) within the context of LDC leadership and responsibility and the general agreements and budget reached in stage (1). The emphasis here is on the technical approach to be utilized and the scheduling and management of project inputs. This may involve a short-term reconnaissance and/or an extensive period of detailed joint planning and feeling out of what is feasible during a preliminary

operating phase of the project, possibly lasting as much as a year or more. This stage recognizes the importance, for the problem-solving or ground breaking types of technical assistance, of involving the U.S. and LDC implementing organizations together as soon as the detailed design work begins. USAID's role here is to facilitate, not direct, the joint planning, assure consistency with prior agreements or concur in changes, affirm that the implementing parties have agreed on a reasonable project design, and prepare or cause to be prepared the documentation required for stage (3), including any amendments that might be required to the project documentation. If and when a decision is made by the host government and USAID to proceed into the operating phase with the same contractor, the U.S. intermediary should be treated as a cooperating partner in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term operating agreement(s) with the host government, host institution and USAID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Implementation. The results of the approach outlined in the stage above should include, in addition to a better understanding and more meaningful commitment by all parties, the following specific products:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A jointly developed life-of-project design which reflects the commitment of all parties and includes clear statements of purpose, principal outputs, eligible types of activity and expenditure limits, critical assumptions, and major progress indicators;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A workplan and input schedule for the first two years or at least as long as the expenditure period for the next obligation of project funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provisions for any administrative support, special services or other inputs by the host country, contractor, and/or USAID; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A plan for periodic joint evaluation and review or progress and subsequent workplans, normally annually, with the participation of all parties.</p><p class="depth0">Appropriate elements of these agreements and understandings are now embodied in a contract for project implementation, as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of the section on Contracting Implications. This contract allows the U.S. intermediary to apply its judgment, reflecting close collaboration with its LDC colleagues, in adjusting the flow of USAID-financed inputs and in making other operational decisions with a minimum of requirements for prior USAID approvals or contract amendments as long as the contractor stays within the bounds of the approved overall plan and budget. In this phase, USAID will give technical assistance contractors the authority and responsibility for using their specialized expertise to the fullest extent in the scheduling and managing of project inputs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring, joint evaluation and replanning. With increased flexibility and responsibility for implementation placed with the technical assistance contractor, the host government, and/or institutional collaborator, improved and timely progress reporting and periodic, joint, and structured reviews of results and evolving plans are imperative as a basis for monitoring and evaluating contractor performance, revalidating or adjusting project design, and for determining future funding levels and commitments.</p><p class="depth0">Both the contractor's annual report and the joint review should be structured within the framework of purpose, outputs, performance indicators, etc., originally established in the project indentification phase--as modified by detailed project design--and reflected in the Project Agreement and other pertinent documentation. The field review will normally serve as the occasion for discussing changes in or additions to previously agreed-to workplans as well as proposing changes in purpose, types of activities authorized and budgets which require contract amendment. Obviously, the appropriate host government, host institution, and senior contractor officials should be thoroughly involved in the process, which will have to be adapted to the conditions within specific projects and countries. An important USAID responsibility is to assure that there is appropriate host country participation in developing and improving project plans prior to new obligations of funds. The special requirements and responsibilities of the various parties shall also be reflected in the project agreement and contract terms and in guidelines on the content of annual reports, evaluation procedures, etc.</p><p class="depth0">Standard checking on services actually delivered as a basis for reimbursement will be continued including appropriate audit of expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contracting implications. The principal elements of change in present contracting practices, as detailed below, are earlier selection and involvement of the prime contractor, contracting by major stages of project design and operations, minimizing the need for precontract negotiations and contract amendments and USAID approvals, and providing technical assistance contractors with the authority and responsibility needed to manage implementation within the approved program bounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Selection. The early involvement of the contractor in the definition stage of a long-term technical assistance project, after USAID decides what it wants to undertake in stage (1), does not alter the Agency's responsibility to select its contractors carefully and in full compliance with appropriate contracting regulations and selection procedures. What is required here is that contractor selection be carried out at an earlier stage than has sometimes been the Agency practice in the past or with other types of

contracts and in anticipation that the contractor, assuming adequate performance, will participate in all subsequent phases until final completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracting stages. In contracting, the initial design stage should be separated from the longer term implementation stage without any USAID commitment to undertake the second until it has exercised its independent judgment based on the product of the first plus any outside expert appraisal it and the host country want to use.</p><p class="depth0">The long-term implementation stage itself may be further subdivided into contract periods which permit time between predetermined events for analysis, determination of new project requirements, and evaluation of performance prior to initiating the next phase by contract amendment/extension. If, for any reason, such an examination does not appear to warrant project continuation, then termination of the project and/or contract would be the next step.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flexible implementation authority. While good project design will eliminate or diminish many operational problems, the very nature of long-term technical assistance requires flexible implementation within agreed purposes, ultimate outputs, types of activity and available financing. With these key variables for USAID management control established, contracts should be written so as to minimize the need for amendments and USAID approval of changes in input particulars. This can be facilitated, both for the USAID, host country, institution, and the contractor by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Retention of operational plan in contract and removal of workplan. The contract narrative will contain the life-of-the-project Operational Plan, consistent with the project design as developed in stage (2) and reflected in the project documentation (and subsequent amendments thereto). The Operational Plan includes a statement of the purpose to be achieved, the outputs to be produced by the contractor and the types of activities to be undertaken, the more significant indicators of progress, a general description of the type of inputs that are authorized and intended to be provided during the life of the project, and the overall budget.</p><p class="depth0">In order to allow adjustments at the implementation level without going through the contract amendment process, the detailed but short-term workplan containing specific descriptions and scheduling of all inputs such as numbers and types of staff, participants, commodities, etc., and specific activities, will not be a part of the contract. It is a working document to be modified in the field when the situation demands. The latest version will be available as a supporting document to justify proposed new obligation levels. Normally, the workplan and derived budget will cover a rolling two year period, i.e., each year another yearly increment is added after review and approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Budget flexibility. To support this implementation flexibility, contract budget or fiscal controls will be shifted from fixed line items for each input category to program categories, permitting the technical assistance contractor to adjust amounts and timing to achieve previously approved types of activity. This same type of flexibility should apply to any local currency supplied for project operations and/or contractor staff support. While an essential corollary to eliminating the workplan from the contract, this is not a unique procedure under cost reimbursement type contracts when the contractor has demonstrated adequate management capability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Negotiation of advance understandings. To permit university and international research center contractors to manage their activities in accordance with their own policies and procedures and thereby sharpen their management responsibility while achieving substantial savings in time and reduced documentation, USAID may negotiate advance understandings with its technical assistance contractors on dollar costs and administrative procedures that would be included by reference in its subsequent contracts. Upon receipt of a request from the contractor that their policies be reviewed and approved for usage in their contract in lieu of the standard terms and conditions, OP/PS/OCC, USAID/W will initiate negotiations of such policies in an expeditious manner. The approved policies will be used in all relevant relations involving the Agency and respective contractors in lieu of traditional contract standard provisions, whenever this may be appropriate. This does not apply to local currency costs and host government procedures which must be negotiated in each case.</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of the practices listed above is not only to give a qualified contractor the authority to adjust the composition and timing of inputs but to assign to it clear responsibility for managing such resources, as the evolving circumstances require, to achieve the agreed-upon outputs on a cost efficient basis. It should also reduce the delay and paperwork involved in frequent but minor contract amendments, and approvals. For the agency as a whole, both in the Mission and in USAID/W, these have involved a large workload and cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Role of USAID. Nothing in this appendix is intended to delegate, diminish or otherwise modify USAID's final responsibility for the prudent management of public funds and its own programs. Rather in withdrawing from the day-to-day involvement in and responsibility for the management of adjustment of the flow of inputs during the implementation, the best use of limited agency staff and time can be devoted to protecting

the public interest in gaining maximum results from the funds appropriated for technical assistance by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Seeking optimum identification in terms of LDC priorities and U.S. capabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mobilizing and selecting the best U.S. professional talent to design and carry out the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring what is happening to assure adequacy of processes, get a feel of results, assure actual delivery of inputs being financed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assuring that the attention of USAID's implementation agents and LDC colleagues stay well focused on project purpose and results to be achieved (outputs) and the relation to these of what is being done and actual results;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Providing intermediaries adequate authority and responsibility to adjust inputs promptly and sensitively to the evolving project situations.</p><p class="depth0">Attention to these considerations, and to achievements of the preimplementation conditions prescribed above, should greatly increase the chances for successful project completion and impact on a cost effective basis, which is the final measurement of prudent management.</p><p class="depth0">Attachment to Appendix F--Guidelines for Requests for Expressions of</p><p class="depth0">Interest</p><p class="depth0">A. Length and Level of Detail</p><p class="depth0">A Request for Expression of Interest (REI) should include more than just a short letter expressing interest, but should not be in the detail of a technical proposal (RFTP). The REI is not the only source of information that can or should be used for selection, but at least a minimum level of information should be contained in each document. A ten page paper that responds to the selection criteria included in every REI should be sufficient for evaluation purposes. The selection criteria should specify the technical inputs required for successful execution of the project and normally require a response in three general areas:</p><p class="depth0">1. A description of the institution's capability to address the problem described in the REI.</p><p class="depth0">2. Any related experience, whether in the country or region or in the problem area.</p><p class="depth0">3. A demonstrable commitment of the institution to support the project.</p><p class="depth0">The responses should address the capability, experience, and commitment to the particular project.</p><p class="depth0">B. Specific Personnel Information</p><p class="depth0">The response should specify within the areas set out in the selection criteria the following planning and personnel factors.</p><p class="depth0">1. The design team plan and the scope of work for each member.</p><p class="depth0">2. A list of candidates for the design team and their credentials.</p><p class="depth0">3. A list of possible candidates for long-term assignment to the project. (Since there has been no project design, the specific technical assistance slots and technical responsibilities are vague. But it is expected that at least half of the personnel needs can be estimated early in the project. The institution should make its best guess for the team and present to the Agency the persons or types of persons with whom they are likely to contract.)</p><p class="depth0">C. Multiple Institution Submissions</p><p class="depth0">Joint effort on the part of several institutions is encouraged when appropriate. A single institution may submit an expression of interest for part of the project without knowledge of other collaborators or it may submit information in response to A and B of this attachment as part of a suggested collection of institutions. In either case, a proposed plan for cooperation is necessary.</p><p class="depth0">However, such joint efforts must specify the division of responsibilities for the planning and personnel factors indicated in B of this attachment. Often USAID will identify the need for cooperation and suggest such an effort in the REI. Even if USAID does not suggest collaboration, joint efforts with a description of the cooperation would be an appropriate way to respond to an REI.

Underlying Principles</p><p class="depth0">USAID favors and encourages the publication of scholarly research as well as the maximum availability, distribution, and use of knowledge developed in its program.</p><p class="depth0">This policy statement does not deal with material that is classified for security reasons. It does deal with considerations of national interest, not of sufficient gravity to warrant security classification, but serious enough to affect adversely the conduct of

U.S. assistance programs. Consequently, in addition to the requirements of courtesy, propriety, and confidence which normally guide scholars in their work, there should also be consideration of the potential repercussions of publication on the successful execution of development and other cooperative programs in which the United States and foreign countries are involved.</p><p class="depth0">3. Operational Definitions</p><p class="depth0">The Agency draws a distinction between two kinds of manuscripts which a scholar may wish to publish:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A report which is prepared and delivered to the Agency under the terms of the contract (a ``contract manuscript''); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An article or book based upon experience and information gained under an USAID contract but not prepared or delivered under the contract (a ``non-contract manuscript'').</p><p class="depth0">There are two kinds of actions, to be specified in the contract, which the Agency can take upon notification of a contractor's desire to publish:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Comment only, under which USAID and the foreign government involved may review the manuscript, and have their comments considered seriously by the contractor prior to publication; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authorization for release, which USAID may withhold if reconciliation between the national interest and the author's interest is impossible.</p><p class="depth0">4. Policy Statements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> USAID, as a general rule, will not require an academic institution to obtain permission to publish the written work produced under a contract. It will ask for the opportunity to review the manuscript for comment only, prior to publication.</p><p class="depth0">In the case of a contract manuscript, USAID reserves the right to disclaim endorsement of the opinions expressed; if it is a noncontract manuscript, USAID reserves the right to disassociate itself from sponsorship or publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On the other hand, USAID may reserve the right of authorization for release in those exceptional cases where conditions exist making it reasonably foreseeable, in light of the contract's scope of work and the manner and place of performance, that the written work to be prepared and delivered under the contract may have adverse repercussions on the relations and programs of the United States. Where this right is reserved, it must be so specified in the contract. In determining where to reserve such right, USAID will consider all relevant factors, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which prompt and full performance of the contract will require access, facilitated by reason of the contract, to information not generally available to scholars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the work involves matters of political concern to foreign countries, particularly where any substantial part of the work is to be performed therein;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which, by reason of USAID's close involvement and cooperation in the performance of the contract, the work product may be so identified with USAID itself as to prevent effective disclaimer of USAID endorsement thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which the objective of the contract is to provide advice to USAID or to a foreign government of immediate operational significance in the conduct of the USAID program or the implementation of governmental programs in the host country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The desires of the host country.</p><p class="depth0">5. Implementation</p><p class="depth0">The successful implementation of this policy on publication rests on a thorough understanding and acceptance of these principles by USAID and the prospective contractor. The actual publications provision for a particular contract, then, would be so worded as to reflect the agreement reached in the contract negotations.</p><p class="depth0">USAID's concern with noncontract manuscripts is related to the identification of a manuscript with the U.S. Government. This concern will be modified by the passage of time following termination of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">In the normal case of prepublication review for USAID comment, the institution will submit a copy of the manuscript not later than the date of submission to the publisher. This gives the Agency time to comment if it is deemed appropriate. However, in the case of review for authorization, timely notification of USAID's response will be given, consistent with the size of the manuscript and the number and location of the parties involved.</p><p class="depth0">The Agency will make every effort to expedite this review procedure in accordance with the underlying principle described at the beginning of this policy statement.

For the purpose of this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a result of (i) the contract's terms or (ii) the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-personal services contract means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Independent contractor relationship means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under these relationships, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, or the manner in which it is to be performed, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Contractor means a cooperating country national or a third country national who has entered into a contract pursuant to this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cooperating country means the country in which the employing USAID Mission is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cooperating country national (CCN) means an individual who is a cooperating country citizen or a non-cooperating country citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the cooperating country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Third Country National (TCN) means an individual</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Who is neither a citizen nor a permanent legal resident alien of the United States nor of the country to which assigned for duty, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Who is eligible for return to his/her home country or country of recruitment at U.S. Government expense [see Section 12, General Provision 9 paragraph (n)].</p><p class="depth0">2. Legal Basis</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``FAA'', provides the Agency's contracting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals ``* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.'' \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.

Policy</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services as part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with a CCN or a TCN for personal services abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Program funds. Under the authority of Section 636(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operating expense funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years but only funded as outlined above.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on Personal Services Contracts. (1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, Cooperating Country or Third Country Nationals may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility, delegated or assigned U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:</p><p class="depth0">a. They may not supervise USDH employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.</p><p class="depth0">b. They may not be designated a Contracting Officer or delegated authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.</p><p class="depth0">c.

They may participate in personnel selection matters but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.</p><p class="depth0">e. Services which involve security classified material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions. Exceptions to the limitations in (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of Employment. (1) General. For the purpose of any law administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, USAID PSC contractors are not to be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government, are not included under any retirement or pension program of the U.S. Government, and are not eligible for the Incentive Awards Program covered by Uniform State/USAID/USIA regulations. Each USAID Mission is expected to participate in the Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program. The program is administered by a joint committee which establishes procedures for submission, review and approval of proposed awards. Other than these exceptions, CCNs and TCNs who are hired for work in a cooperating country under PSCs generally will be extended the same benefits and be subject to the same restrictions as Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) employed as direct-hires by the USAID Mission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

(i) It is USAID's general policy (see AIDAR 722.170) that PSC compensation may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or Assistant Administrator, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country. Compensation for TCN or CCN personal services contractors set in accordance with the provisions of 4c(2)(ii) below satisfies this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is USAID's general policy (see AIDAR 722.170) that PSC compensation may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or Assistant Administrator, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country. Compensation for TCN or CCN personal services contractors set in accordance with the provisions of 4c(2)(ii) below satisfies this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with Section 408(a)(1) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, a local compensation plan forms the basis for all compensation payments to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs. The plan is each post's official system of position classification and pay, consisting of the local salary schedule which includes salary rates, statements authorizing fringe benefit payments, and other pertinent facets of compensation for TCNs and CCNs, and the local position classification system as reflected in the Local Employee Position Classification Handbook (LEPCH) or equivalent in effect at the Mission. Compensation for PSCs will be in accordance with the local compensation plan, to the extent that it covers employees of the type or category being employed, unless the Mission Director determines otherwise. If the Mission Director determines that compensation in accordance with the local plan would be inappropriate in a particular instance, then compensation will be set in accordance with (in order of preference):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any other Mission policies on foreign national employee compensation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Paragraphs 4(c) (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i) of appendix D. When compensation is set in accordance with this exception, the record shall be documented in writing with a justification prepared by the requesting office and approved by the Mission Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The earning of leave (annual and sick), allowances and differential (if applicable), salaries and all other related benefits cannot be enumerated in this appendix as they vary from Mission to Mission and are based upon the compensation plan for each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unless otherwise authorized, the currency in which compensation is paid to contractors shall be in accordance with the prevailing local compensation practice of the post.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> CCN and TCN contractors are eligible for allowances and differential on the same basis as direct-hire FSN employees under the post compensation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A USAID PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired U.S. Civil Service, U.S. Foreign Service, or U.S. military service member, and who is covered by their spouse's government health or life insurance policy, is ineligible for a contribution towards the costs of annual health and life insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Retired CCNs and TCNs may be awarded personal services contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incentives Awards.

CCN and TCN PSCs are eligible for most of the training courses offered in the Training Course Schedule. However, applications will be processed on a case-by-case basis and are required to be approved by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for; the statement shall be included in the procurement request. The procurement request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A certification from the officer in the Mission responsible for the LEPCH or equivalent that the position has been reviewed and is properly classified as to a title, series and grade in accordance with the LEPCH.

(1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Three sets of certified biographical data and salary history. (Upon receipt, one copy of the above information shall be forwarded to the Project Officer);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, and General Provisions as well as the FAR Clause to be included in full text and a list of those to be incorporated by reference; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of General Notice entitled ``Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct'' dated October 30, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contracting Officer shall comply with the limitations of AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Competition. (1) Under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. Use of this class justification for Personal Services Contracts with Cooperating Country Nationals and Third Country Nationals is subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> New contracts are publicized consistent with Mission/Embassy practice on announcement of direct hire FSN positions. Renewals or extensions with the same individual for continuing service do not need to be publicized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable. If the conditions in paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) are not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Since the award of a personal services contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the biographical data and salary history are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR Subparts 15.4 and 15.5 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this appendix shall govern.</p><p class="depth0">6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract</p><p class="depth0">Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection and negotiations procedures are more akin to the personal selection procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of biographical data and salary history received under the solicitation to the Technical Officer for evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of biographical data and salary history received under the solicitation to the Technical Officer for evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the Contracting Officer

shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. The terms and conditions of the contract will normally be in accordance with the local compensation plan which forms the basis for all compensation on payments paid to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the certified statement of biographical data and salary history as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the Technical Officer's cost estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contracting Officer will obtain necessary data for a security and suitability clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapters.</p><p class="depth0">7.
