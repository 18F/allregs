For a person aboard a vessel to fish  for golden crab in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess golden crab in or  from the South Atlantic EEZ, off-load golden crab from the South  Atlantic EEZ, or sell golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a  commercial vessel permit for golden crab must be issued to the vessel  and must be on board. It is a rebuttable presumption that a golden crab  on board a vessel in the South Atlantic or off-loaded from a vessel in a  port adjoining the South Atlantic was harvested from the South Atlantic  EEZ. See Sec. 622.241 for limitations on the use, transfer, and renewal  of a commercial vessel permit for golden crab.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dealer permits and conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permits.
