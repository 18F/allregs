                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(a))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Unless specifically provided. On basis of facts found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disability benefits--(1) Disability pension (Sec.  3.3). An award of disability pension may not be effective prior to the date entitlement arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Claims received prior to October 1, 1984. Date of receipt of claim or date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled, if claim is filed within one year from such date, whichever is to the advantage of the veteran.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Claims received on or after October 1, 1984. (A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, date of receipt of claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If, within one year from the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled, the veteran files a claim for a retroactive award and establishes that a physical or mental disability, which was not the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct, was so incapacitating that it prevented him or her from filing a disability pension claim for at least the first 30 days immediately following the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled, the disability pension award may be effective from the date of receipt of claim or the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled, whichever is to the advantage of the veteran. While rating board judgment must be

applied to the facts and circumstances of each case, extensive hospitalization will generally qualify as sufficiently incapacitating to have prevented the filing of a claim. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the presumptive provisions of Sec.  3.342(a) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disability compensation--(i) Direct service connection (Sec.  3.4(b)). Day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Separation from service means separation under conditions other than dishonorable from continuous active service which extended from the date the disability was incurred or aggravated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Presumptive service connection (Sec. Sec.  3.307, 3.308, 3.309). Date entitlement arose, if claim is received within 1 year after separation from active duty; otherwise date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Where the requirements for service connection are met during service, the effective date will be the day following separation from service if there was continuous active service following the period of service on which the presumption is based and a claim is received within 1 year after separation from active duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Death benefits--(1) Death in service (38 U.S.C. 5110(j), Pub. L. 87-825) (Sec. Sec.  3.4(c), 3.5(b)). First day of the month fixed by the Secretary concerned as the date of actual or presumed death, if claim is received with 1 year after the date the initial report of actual death or finding of presumed death was made; however benefits based on a report of actual death are not payable for any period for which the claimant has received, or is entitled to receive an allowance, allotment, or service pay of the veteran.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Service-connected death after separation from service (38 U.S.C. 5110(d), Pub. L. 87-825) (Sec. Sec.  3.4(c), 3.5(b)). First day of the month in which the veteran's death occurred if claim is received within 1 year after the date of death; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonservice-connected death after separation from service.

First day of the month in which entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after the date of entitlement; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deaths on or after May 1, 1957 (in-service waiver cases) (Sec.
