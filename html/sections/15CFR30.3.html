                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The filer of EEI for export transactions  is either the USPPI, or the U.S. authorized agent. All EEI submitted to  the AES shall be complete, correct, and based on personal knowledge of  the facts stated or on information furnished by the parties to the  export transaction. The filer shall be physically located in the United  States at the time of filing, have an EIN or DUNS and be certified to  report in the AES. In the event that the filer does not have an EIN or  DUNS, the filer must obtain an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service.  The filer is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and completeness of  the EEI, except insofar as that party can demonstrate that it reasonably  relied on information furnished by other responsible persons  participating in the transaction. All parties involved in export  transactions, including U.S. authorized agents, should be aware that  invoices and other commercial documents may not necessarily contain all  the information needed to prepare the EEI. The parties shall ensure that  all information needed for reporting to the AES, including correct  export licensing information, is provided to the U.S. authorized agent  for the purpose of correctly preparing the EEI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parties to the export transaction--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Principal parties in  interest. Those persons in a transaction that receive the primary  benefit, monetary or otherwise, are considered principal parties   to the transaction. Generally, the principal parties in interest in a  transaction are the seller and buyer. In most cases, the forwarding or  other agent is not a principal party in interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> USPPI. For purposes of filing EEI, the USPPI is the person or  legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit,  monetary or otherwise, from the transaction. Generally, that person or  entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, order party, or foreign entity  if in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for  export. The foreign entity shall be listed as the USPPI if it is in the  United States when the items are purchased or obtained for export. The  foreign entity shall then follow the provisions for filing the EEI  specified in Sec. Sec. 30.3 and 30.6 pertaining to the USPPI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods directly to an entity in a  foreign area, the U.S. manufacturer shall be listed as the USPPI in the  EEI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods, as a domestic sale, to a  U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) and that U.S. buyer sells the goods  for export to a FPPI, the U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) shall be  listed as the USPPI in the EEI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a U.S. order party directly arranges for the sale and  export of goods to the FPPI, the U.S. order party shall be listed as the  USPPI in the EEI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a customs broker is listed as the importer of record when  entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or  warehousing entry, the customs broker may be listed as the USPPI in the  EEI if the goods are subsequently exported without change or  enhancement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a foreign person is listed as the importer of record when  entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or  warehousing entry, the customs broker who entered the goods, may be  listed as the USPPI in the EEI if the goods are subsequently exported  without change or enhancement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized agent. The agent shall be authorized by the USPPI or,  in the case of a routed export transaction, the agent shall be  authorized by the FPPI to prepare and file the EEI. In a routed export  transaction, the authorized agent can be the ``exporter'' for export  control purposes as defined in 15 CFR 772.1 of the U.S. Department of  Commerce EAR. However, the authorized agent shall not be shown as the  USPPI in the EEI unless the agent acts as a USPPI in the export  transaction as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Carrier. A carrier is an individual or legal entity in the  business of transporting passengers or goods. Airlines, trucking  companies, railroad companies, shipping lines, and pipeline companies  are all examples of carriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General responsibilities of parties in export transactions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  USPPI responsibilities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The USPPI can prepare and file the EEI  itself, or it can authorize an agent to prepare and file the EEI on its  behalf. If the USPPI prepares the EEI itself, the USPPI is responsible  for the accuracy and timely transmission of all the export information  reported to the AES.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the USPPI authorizes an agent to file the EEI on its  behalf, the USPPI is responsible for:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Providing the authorized agent with accurate and timely export  information necessary to file the EEI.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Providing the authorized agent with a power of attorney or  written authorization to file the EEI (see paragraph (f) of this section  for written authorization requirements for agents).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Retaining documentation to support the information provided to  the authorized agent for filing the EEI, as specified in Sec. 30.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized agent responsibilities. The agent, when authorized by  a USPPI to prepare and file the EEI for an export transaction, is  responsible for performing the following activities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Accurate preparation and timely filing of the EEI based on  information received from the USPPI and other parties involved in the  transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtaining a power of attorney or written authorization from the  USPPI to file the EEI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Retaining documentation to support the information reported to  the AES, as specified in Sec. 30.10.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon request, providing the USPPI with a copy of the export  information filed in a mutually agreed upon format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carrier responsibilities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The carrier must not load or move  cargo unless the required documentation, from the USPPI or authorized  agent, contains the required AES proof of filing, postdeparture,  downtime, exclusion or exemption citations. This information must be  cited on the first page of the bill of lading, air waybill, or other  commercial loading documents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The carrier must annotate the AES proof of filing,  postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations on the  carrier's outbound manifest when required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The carrier is responsible for presenting the required AES  proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption  citations to the CBP Port Director at the port of export as stated in  Subpart E of this part. Such presentation shall be without material  change or amendment of the proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime,  exclusion or exemption citation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The carrier shall notify the USPPI or the authorized agent of  changes to the transportation data, and the USPPI or the authorized  agent shall electronically transmit the corrections, cancellations, or  amendments as soon as the corrections are known in accordance with Sec.  30.9. Manifest amendments must be made in accordance with CBP  regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Retain documents pertaining to the export shipment as specified  in Sec. 30.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filer responsibilities. Responsibilities of USPPIs and  authorized agents filing EEI are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing complete and accurate information (see Sec. 30.4 for a  delineation of filing responsibilities of USPPIs and authorized agents).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Filing information in a timely manner in accordance with the  provisions and requirements contained in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Responding to fatal errors, warning, verify and reminder  messages, and compliance alerts generated by the AES in accordance with  provisions and requirements contained in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Providing the exporting carrier with the required proof of  filing citations or exemption legends in accordance with provisions  contained in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Promptly filing corrections or cancellations to EEI in  accordance with provisions contained in Sec. 30.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Retaining all necessary and proper documentation related to EEI  transactions in accordance with provisions contained in this part (see  Sec. 30.10 for specific requirements for retaining and producing  documentation for export shipments).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Responsibilities of parties in a routed export transaction. The  Census Bureau recognizes ``routed export transactions'' as a subset of  export transactions. A routed export transaction is a transaction in  which the FPPI authorizes a U.S. agent to facilitate the export of items  from the United States and to prepare and file EEI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USPPI responsibilities. In a routed export transaction, the FPPI  may authorize or agree to allow the USPPI to prepare and file the EEI.  If the FPPI agrees to allow the USPPI to file the EEI, the FPPI must  provide a written authorization to the USPPI assuming the responsibility  for filing. The USPPI may authorize an agent to file the EEI on its  behalf. If the USPPI or its agent prepares and files the EEI, it shall  retain documentation to support the EEI filed. If the FPPI agrees to  allow the USPPI to file EEI, the filing of the export transaction shall  be treated as a routed export transaction. If the FPPI authorizes an  agent to prepare and file the EEI, the USPPI shall retain documentation  to support the information provided to the agent for preparing the EEI  as specified in Sec. 30.10 and provide the agent with the following  information to assist in preparing the EEI:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the USPPI.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> USPPI's EIN or DUNS</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State of origin (State).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> FTZ if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Commercial description of commodities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Origin of goods indicator: Domestic (D) or Foreign (F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Schedule B or HTSUSA, Classification Commodity Code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Quantities/units of measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or sufficient  technical information to determine the ECCN.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> All licensing information necessary to file the EEI for  commodities   where the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, or other U.S.  government agency issues a license for the commodities being exported,  or the merchandise is being exported under a license exemption or  license exception.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Any information that it knows will affect the determination of  license authorization (see Subpart B of this part for additional  information on licensing requirements).</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (e)(1) of this section: For items in paragraph (e)  (1) (ix), (x),(xi) and (xii) of this section, where the FPPI has assumed  responsibility for determining and obtaining license authority see  requirements set forth in 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized agent responsibilities. In a routed export  transaction, if an authorized agent is preparing and filing the EEI on  behalf of the FPPI, the authorized agent must obtain a power of attorney  or written authorization from the FPPI and prepare and file the EEI  based on information obtained from the USPPI or other parties involved  in the transaction. The authorized agent shall be responsible for filing  the EEI accurately and timely in accordance with the FTR. Upon request,  the authorized agent will provide the USPPI with a copy of the power of  attorney or written authorization from the FPPI. The authorized agent  shall also retain documentation to support the EEI reported through the  AES. The agents shall upon request, provide the USPPI with the data  elements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (xii) of this section as  submitted through the AES. The authorized agent shall provide the  following export information through the AES:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Date of export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transportation Reference Number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ultimate consignee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Intermediate consignee, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Authorized agent name and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> EIN or DUNS of the authorized agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Country of ultimate destination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Method of transportation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Carrier identification and conveyance name.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Port of export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Foreign port of unloading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Shipping weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> ECCN.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> License or license exemption information.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (e)(2) of this section: For items in paragraphs  (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of this section, where the FPPI has assumed  responsibility for determining and obtaining license authority, see  requirements set forth in 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Authorizing an agent. In a power of attorney or other written  authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain  specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal (see 15 CFR  758.1(h) of the EAR). In cases where an authorized agent is filing EEI  to the AES, the agent shall obtain a power of attorney or written  authorization from a principal party in interest to file the information  on its behalf. A power of attorney or written authorization should  specify the responsibilities of the parties with particularity and  should state that the agent has authority to act on behalf of a  principal party in interest as its true and lawful agent for purposes of  creating and filing EEI in accordance with the laws and regulations of  the United States. In routed export transactions the USPPI is not  required to provide an agent of the FPPI with a power of attorney or  written authorization.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 30.3: The EAR defines the ``exporter'' as the person  in the United States who has the authority of a principal party in  interest to determine and control the sending of items out of the United  States (see 15 CFR 772 of the EAR). For statistical purposes  ``exporter'' is not defined in the FTR. Instead, however, the USPPI is  defined in the FTR.   For purposes of licensing responsibility under the EAR, the U.S. agent  of the FPPI may be the ``exporter'' or applicant on the license in  certain routed export transactions (see 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR).  Therefore, due to the differences in export reporting requirements among  Federal agencies, conformity of documentation is not required in the  FTR.  [73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 38916, Aug. 5, 2009; 78  FR 16375, Mar. 14, 2013]</p>
