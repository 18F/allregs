                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of section 527 and these regulations:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Political organization--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A political organization  is a party, committee, association, fund, or other organization (whether  or not incorporated) organized and operated primarily for the purpose of  directly or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures  for an exempt function activity (as defined in paragraph (c) of this  section). Accordingly, a political organization may include a committee  or other group which accepts contributions or makes expenditures for the  purpose of promoting the nomination of an individual for an elective  public office in a primary election, or in a meeting or caucus of a  political party. A segregated fund (as defined in paragraph (b) of this  section) established and maintained by an individual may qualify as a  political organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organizational test. A political organization meets the  organizational test if its articles of organization provide that the  primary purpose of the organization is to carry on one or more exempt  functions. A political organization is not required to be formally  chartered or established as a corporation, trust, or association. If an  organization has no formal articles of organization, consideration is  given to statements of the members of the organization at the time the  organization is formed that they intend to operate the organization  primarily to carry on one or more exempt functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operational test. A political organization does not have to  engage exclusively in activities that are an exempt function. For  example, a political organization may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sponsor nonpartisan educational workshops which are not intended  to influence or attempt to influence the selection, nomination,  election, or appointment of any individual for public office,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pay an incumbent's office expenses, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Carry on social activities which are unrelated to its exempt  function,  provided these are not the organization's primary activities. However,  expenditures for purposes described in the preceding sentence are not  for an exempt function. See Sec. 1.527-2 (c) and (d). Furthermore, it is  not necessary that a political organization operate in accordance with  normal corporate formalities as ordinarily established in bylaws or  under state law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Segregated fund--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A segregated fund is a fund  which is established and maintained by a political organization or an  individual separate from the assets of the organization or the personal  assets of the individual. The purpose of such a fund must be to receive  and segregate exempt function income (and earnings on such income) for  use only for an exempt function or for an activity necessary to fulfill  an exempt function. Accordingly, the amounts in the fund must be  dedicated for use only for an exempt function. Thus, expenditures for  the establishment or administration of a political organization or the  solicitation of political contributions may be made from the segregated  fund, if necessary to fulfill an exempt function. The fund must be  clearly identified and established for the pruposes intended. A savings  or checking account into which only contributions to the political  organization are placed and from which only expenditures for exempt  functions are made may be a segregated fund. If an organization that had  designated a fund to be a segregated fund for purposes of segregating  amounts referred to in section 527(c)(3) (A) through (D), expends more  than an insubstantial amount from the segregated fund for activities  that are not for an exempt function during a taxable year, the fund will  not be treated as a segregated fund for such year. In such a case  amounts referred to in section 527(c)(3)(A)-(D),segregated in such fund  will not be exempt function income. Further, if more than insubstantial  amounts segregated for an   exempt function in prior years are expended for other than an exempt  function the facts and circumstances may indicate that the fund was  never a segregated fund as defined in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Record keeping. The organization or individual maintaining a  segregated fund must keep records that are adequate to verify receipts  and disbursements of the fund and identify the exempt function activity  for which each expenditure is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exempt function--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directly related expenses. An exempt  function, as defined in section 527(e)(2), includes all activities that  are directly related to and support the process of influencing or  attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or  appointment of any individual to public office or office in a political  organization (the selection process). Whether an expenditure is for an  exempt function depends upon all the facts and circumstances. Generally,  where an organization supports an individual's campaign for public  office, the organization's activities and expenditures in futherance of  the individual's election or appointment to that office are for an  exempt function of the organization. The individual does not have to be  an announced candidate for the office. Furthermore, the fact that an  individual never becomes a candidate is not crucial in determining  whether an organization is engaging in an exempt function. An activity  engaged in between elections which is directly related to, and supports,  the process of selection, nomination, or election of an individual in  the next applicable political campaign is an exempt function activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indirect expenses. Expenditures that are not directly related to  influencing or attempting to influence the selection process may also be  an expenditure for an exempt function by a political organization. These  are expenses which are necessary to support the directly related  activities of the political organization. Activities which support the  directly related activities are those which must be engaged in to allow  the political organization to carry out the activity of influencing or  attempting to influence the selection process. For example, expenses for  overhead and record keeping are necessary to allow the political  organization to be established and to engage in political activities.  Similarly, expenses incurred in soliciting contributions to the  political organization are necessary to support the activities of the  political organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terminating activities. An exempt function includes an activity  which is in furtherance of the process of terminating a political  organization's existence. For example, where a political organization is  established for a single campaign, payment of campaign debts after the  conclusion of the campaign is an exempt function activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Illegal expenditures. Expenditures which are illegal or are for  a judicially determined illegal activity are not considered expenditures  in furtherance of an exempt function, even though such expenditures are  made in connection with the selection process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  paragraph (c) of this section. The term exempt function when used in the  following examples means exempt function within the meaning of section  527(e)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Example 1. A wants to run for election to public office in State  X. A is not a candidate. A travels throughout X in order to rally  support for A's intended candidacy. While in X, A attends a convention  of an organization for the purpose of attempting to solicit its support.  The amount expended for travel, lodging, food, and similar expenses are  for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example 2. B, a member of the United States House of  Representatives, is a candidate for reelection. B travels with B's  spouse to the district B represents. B feels it is important for B's  reelection that B's spouse accompany B. While in the district, B makes  speeches and appearances for the purpose of persuading voters to reelect  B. The travel expenses of B and B's spouse are for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Example 3. C is a candidate for public office. In connection  with C's campaign, C takes voice and speech lessons to improve C's  skills. The expenses for these lessons are for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Example 4. D, an officeholder and candidate for reelection,  purchases tickets to a testimonial dinner. D's attendance at the dinner  is intended to aid D's reelection. Such expenditures are for an exempt  function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Example 5. E, an officeholder, expends amounts for periodicals  of general circulation in order to keep informed on national and local  issues. Such expenditures are not for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Example 6. N is an organization described in section 501(c) and  is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). F is employed as president  of N. F, as a representative of N, testifies in response to a written  request from a Congressional committee in support of the confirmation of  an individual to a cabinet position. The expenditures by N that are  directly related to F's testimony are not for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Example 7. P is a political organization described in section  527(e)(2). Between elections P does not support any particular  individual for public office. However, P does train staff members for  the next election, drafts party rules, implements party reform  proposals, and sponsors a party convention. The expenditures for these  activities are for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Example 8. Q is a political organization described in section  527(e)(2). Q finances seminars and conferences which are intended to  influence persons who attend to support individuals to public office  whose political philosophy is in harmony with the political philosophy  of Q. The expenditures for these activities are for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public office. The facts and circumstances of each case will  determine whether a particular Federal, State, or local office is a  public office. Principles consistent with those found under  Sec. 53.4946-1(g)(2) (relating to the definition of public office) will  be applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e))</em>, as  amended, and section 527(h) and Sec. 1.527-9.
