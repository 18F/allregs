Any state may apply to the Bureau to exempt a  class of transactions within the state from the requirements of chapter  2 (Credit transactions) or chapter 4 (Credit billing) of the Act and the  corresponding provisions of this part. The Bureau shall grant an  exemption if it determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The state law is substantially similar to the Federal law or, in  the case of chapter 4, affords the consumer greater protection than the  Federal law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is adequate provision for enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Civil liability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No exemptions granted under this section  shall extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130 and 131  of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an exemption has been granted, the disclosures required by  the applicable state law (except any additional requirements not imposed  by Federal law) shall constitute the disclosures required by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications. The procedures under which a state may apply for  an exemption under this section are set forth in appendix B to this  part.</p>
