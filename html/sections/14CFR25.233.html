This may be shown while establishing the 90[deg] cross component of wind velocity required by Sec. 25.237.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Landplanes must be satisfactorily controllable, without exceptional piloting skill or alertness, in power-off landings at normal landing speed, without using brakes or engine power to maintain a straight path. This may be shown during power-off landings made in conjunction with other tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The airplane must have adequate directional control during taxiing. This may be shown during taxiing prior to takeoffs made in conjunction with other tests.
