                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discriminatory purpose. A change affecting voting is considered  to have a discriminatory purpose under section 5 if it is enacted or  sought to be administered with any purpose of denying or abridging the  right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language  minority group. The term ``purpose'' in section 5 includes any  discriminatory purpose. 42 U.S.C. 1973c. The Attorney General's  evaluation of discriminatory purpose under section 5 is guided by the  analysis in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing  Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discriminatory effect. A change affecting voting is considered  to have a discriminatory effect under section 5 if it will lead to a  retrogression in the position of members of a racial or language  minority group (i.e., will make members of such a group worse off than  they had been before the change) with respect to their effective  exercise of the electoral franchise. Beer v. United States, 425 U.S.  130, 140-42 (1976).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Benchmark. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether a submitted change is  retrogressive the Attorney General will normally compare the submitted  change to the voting standard, practice, or procedure in force or effect  at the time of the submission. If the existing standard, practice, or  procedure upon submission was not in effect on the jurisdiction's  applicable date for coverage (specified in the Appendix) and is not  otherwise legally enforceable under section 5, it cannot serve as a  benchmark, and, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section,  the comparison shall be with the last legally enforceable standard,  practice, or procedure used by the jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Attorney General will make the comparison based on the  conditions existing at the time of the submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The implementation and use of an unprecleared voting change  subject to section 5 review does not operate to make that unprecleared  change a benchmark for any subsequent change submitted by the  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where at the time of submission of a change for section 5 review  there exists no other lawful standard, practice, or procedure for use as  a benchmark (e.g., where a newly incorporated college district selects a  method of election) the Attorney General's determination will  necessarily center on whether the submitted change was designed or  adopted for the purpose of discriminating against members of racial or  language minority groups.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Protection of the ability to elect. Any change affecting voting  that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the  ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race, color,  or membership in a language minority group to elect their preferred  candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the  meaning of section 5. 42 U.S.C. 1973c.  [Order 3262-2011, 76 FR 21248, Apr. 15, 2011]</p>
