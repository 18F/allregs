                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Circumstance under which an aggrieved party withdraws a complaint regarding an NCD. An aggrieved party who filed a complaint regarding an NCD may withdraw the complaint before the Board issues a decision regarding that NCD. The aggrieved party may not file another complaint concerning the same coverage determination for 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Process for an aggrieved party withdrawing a complaint regarding an NCD. To withdraw a complaint regarding an NCD, the aggrieved party who filed the complaint must send a written withdrawal notice to the Board (see Sec. 426.500) and CMS. Supplementing an acceptable complaint with new evidence does not constitute a withdrawal of a complaint, as described in Sec. 426.503.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actions the Board must take upon receiving a notice announcing the intent to withdraw a complaint regarding an NCD--(1) NCD reviews involving one aggrieved party. If the Board receives a withdrawal notice regarding an NCD before the date the Board issued a decision regarding that NCD, the Board issues a decision dismissing the complaint under Sec. 426.544 and informs the aggrieved party that he or she may not file another complaint to the same coverage determination for 6 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NCD reviews involving one aggrieved party. If the Board receives a withdrawal notice regarding an NCD before the date the Board issued a decision regarding that NCD, the Board issues a decision dismissing the complaint under Sec. 426.544 and informs the aggrieved party that he or she may not file another complaint to the same coverage determination for 6 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NCD reviews involving joint complaints. If the Board receives a notice from an aggrieved party who is named in a joint complaint withdrawing a complaint regarding an NCD before the

date the Board issued a decision regarding that NCD, the Board issues a decision dismissing only that aggrieved party from the complaint under Sec. 426.544. The Board continues the NCD review if there is one or more aggrieved party who does not withdraw from the joint complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consolidated NCD reviews. If the Board receives a notice from an aggrieved party who is part of a consolidated NCD review withdrawing a complaint regarding an NCD before the date the Board issued a decision regarding that NCD, the Board removes that aggrieved party from the consolidated NCD review and issues a decision dismissing that aggrieved party's complaint under Sec. 426.544. The Board continues the NCD review if there is one or more aggrieved party who does not withdraw from the joint complaint.</p>
