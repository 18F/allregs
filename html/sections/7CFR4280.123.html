                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will service RES and EEI grants in accordance with the  requirements specified in Departmental Regulations; 7 CFR part 1951,  subparts E and O, other than 7 CFR 1951.709(d)(1)(B)(iv); the Grant  Agreement; and paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Inspections. Grantees must permit periodic inspection of the  project records and operations by a representative of the Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section. If the  changes result in lowering the project's score to below what would have  qualified the application for award, the Agency will not approve the  changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grantees must submit requests for programmatic changes in  writing to the Agency for Agency approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to obtain prior Agency approval of any such change  could result in such remedies as suspension, termination, and recovery  of grant funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prior Agency approval is required for all increases in project  costs. Prior Agency approval is required for a decrease in project cost  only if the decrease would have a negative effect on the long-term  viability of the project. A decrease in project cost that does not have  a negative impact on long-term viability requires Agency review and  approval prior to disbursement of funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changes in project cost or scope. If there is a significant  change in project cost or any change in project scope, then the  grantee's funding needs, eligibility, and scoring, as applicable, will  be reassessed. Decreases in Agency funds will be based on revised  project costs and other factors, including Agency regulations used at  the time of grant approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, or  Sec. 4280.119(b)(4), as applicable, to demonstrate to the Agency's  satisfaction that such change maintains project integrity. If the Agency  determines that project integrity continues to be demonstrated, the  grantee may make the change. If the Agency determines that project  integrity is no longer demonstrated, the change will not be approved and  the grantee has the following options: Continue with the original  contractor or vendor; find another contractor or vendor that has  qualifications and experience acceptable to the Agency to complete the  project; or terminate the grant by providing a written request to the  Agency. No additional funding will be available from the Agency if costs  for the project have increased. The Agency decision will be provided in  writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfer of obligations. Prior to the construction of the  project, the grantee may request, in writing, a transfer of obligation  to a different (substitute) grantee. Subject to   Agency approval provided in writing, an obligation of funds established  for a grantee may be transferred to a substitute grantee provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The substituted grantee</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is eligible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has a close and genuine relationship with the original grantee;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has the authority to receive the assistance approved for the  original grantee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The type of RES or EEI technology, the project cost and scope of  the project for which the Agency funds will be used remain unchanged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of ownership. After the project is completed and  operational, the grantee may request, in writing, a transfer of the  Grant Agreement to another entity. Subject to Agency approval provided  in writing, the Grant Agreement may be transferred to another entity  provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The entity is determined by the Agency to be an eligible entity  under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The type of RES or EEI technology and the scope of the project  for which the Agency funds will be used remain unchanged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Disposition of acquired property. Grantees must abide by the  disposition requirements outlined in Departmental Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial management system. The grantee will provide for a  financial system that will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial  results of each grant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Records that identify adequately the source and application of  funds for grant-supporting activities, together with documentation to  support the records. Those records must contain information pertaining  to grant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,  assets, liabilities, outlays, and income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective control over and accountability for all funds. The  grantee must adequately safeguard all such assets and must ensure that  funds are used solely for authorized purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Records. The grantee will retain financial records, supporting  documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the  grant for a period of at least 3 years after completion of grant  activities except that the records must be retained beyond the 3-year  period if audit findings have not been resolved or if directed by the  United States. The Agency and the Comptroller General of the United  States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, must have  access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the grantee that  are pertinent to the specific grant for the purpose of making audit,  examination, excerpts, and transcripts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Audit requirements. If applicable, grantees must provide an  annual audit in accordance with 7 CFR part 3052. The Agency may exercise  its right to do a program audit after the end of the project to ensure  that all funding supported Eligible Project Costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Grant disbursement. As applicable, grantees must disburse grant  funds as scheduled in accordance with the appropriate construction and  inspection requirements in Sec. Sec. 4280.118, 4280.119 or 4280.124 as  applicable. Unless required by third parties providing cost sharing  payments to be provided on a pro-rata basis with other funds, grant  funds will be disbursed after all other funds have been expended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless authorized by the Agency to do so, grantees may submit  requests for reimbursement no more frequently than monthly. Ordinarily,  payment will be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper request  for reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grantees must not request reimbursement for the Federal share of  amounts withheld from contractors to ensure satisfactory completion of  work until after it makes those payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments will be made by electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Grantees must use SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for  Reimbursement for Construction Programs,'' or other format prescribed by  the Agency to request grant reimbursements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For a grant awarded to a project with Total Project Costs of  $200,000 and greater, grant funds will be disbursed in accordance with  the above through 90 percent of grant disbursement. The final 10 percent  of grant funds will be held by the Agency until construction of the  project is completed, the project is operational, and the project has  met or exceeded the steady state operating level as set out in the grant  award requirements. In addition, the Agency reserves the right to  request additional information or testing if upon a final site visit the  30 day steady state operating level is not found acceptable to the  Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring of project. Grantees are responsible for ensuring  that all activities are performed within the approved scope of work and  that funds are only used for approved purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Grantees shall constantly monitor performance to ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time schedules are being met;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Projected work is being accomplished by projected time periods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Financial resources are being appropriately expended by  contractors (if applicable); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any other performance objectives identified in the scope of  work are being achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the extent that resources are available, the Agency will  monitor grantees to ensure that activities are performed in accordance  with the Agency-approved scope of work and to ensure that funds are  expended for approved purposes. The Agency's monitoring of grantees  neither:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Relieves the grantee of its responsibilities to ensure that  activities are performed within the scope of work approved by the Agency  and that funds are expended for approved purposes only; nor</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides recourse or a defense to the grantee should the  grantee conduct unapproved activities, engage in unethical conduct,  engage in activities that are or that give the appearance of a conflict  of interest, or expend funds for unapproved purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal Financial Reports. Between grant approval and completion  of project (i.e., construction), SF-425, ``Federal Financial Report''  will be required of all grantees as applicable on a semiannual basis.  The grantee will complete the project within the total sums available to  it, including the grant, in accordance with the scope of work and any  necessary modifications thereof prepared by grantee and approved by the  Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> and  (ii) of this section. These reports are due 30 working days after June  30 and December 31 of each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Semiannual project performance reports. Each semiannual project  performance report must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives for  that period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reasons why established objectives were not met, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reasons for any problems, delays, or adverse conditions which  will affect attainment of overall program objectives, prevent meeting  time schedules or objectives, or preclude the attainment of particular  objectives during established time periods. This disclosure must be  accompanied by a statement of the action taken or planned to resolve the  situation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Objectives and timetables established for the next reporting  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Final project development report. The final project development  report must be submitted 90 days after project completion and include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A detailed project funding and expense summary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A summary of the project's installation/construction process,  including recommendations for development of similar projects by future  Applicants to the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em>  or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> through (G) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Type of technology;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The actual annual amount of energy generated in BTUs, kilowatt- hours, or similar energy equivalents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Annual income for systems that are selling energy, if  applicable, and/or energy savings of the RES;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A summary of the cost of operations and maintenance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A description of any associated major maintenance or operational  problems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Recommendations for development of future similar projects; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Actual number of jobs, if any, created or saved as a direct  result of the RES project for which REAP funding was used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Energy Efficiency Improvements.
