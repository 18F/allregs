                            <p class="depth0">Whenever the labeling of an antibiotic drug included in the regulations in this chapter suggests or recommends its use in milk-producing animals, the label of such drugs shall bear either the statement ``Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this use will result in contamination of the milk'' or the statement ``Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and for ----hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food'', the blank being filled in with the figure that the Commissioner has authorized the manufacturer of the drug to use. The Commissioner shall determine what such figures shall be from information submitted by the manufacturer and which the Commissioner considers is adequate to prove that period of time after the latest treatment that the milk from treated animals will contain no violative residues from use of the preparation. If the Commissioner determines from the information submitted that the use of the antibiotic drug as recommended does not result in its appearance in the milk, the Commissioner may exempt

the drug from bearing either of the above warning statements.
