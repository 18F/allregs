Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Executive Order 12250 and regulations issued thereunder, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other regulations or instructions, insofar as they prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this regulation is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supervision and coordination.
