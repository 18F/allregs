                            <p class="depth0">Second, the siting provision requiring diversity of geohydrologic  settings, as specified in Sec. 960.3-1-1, shall be applied to group all  potentially acceptable sites according to their geohydrologic settings.  Third, for those geohydrologic settings that contain more than one  potentially acceptable site, the preferred site shall be selected on the  basis of a comparative evaluation of all potentially acceptable sites in  that setting. This evaluation shall consider the distinguishing  characteristics displayed by the potentially acceptable sites within the  setting and the related guidelines from subparts C and D. That is, the  appropriate guidelines shall be selected primarily on the basis of the  kinds of evidence among sites for which distinguishing characteristics  can be identified. Such comparative evaluation shall be made on the  basis of the qualifying conditions for those guidelines, considering, on  balance, the favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions  identified at each site. Due consideration shall also be given to the  siting provisions specifying the basis for site evaluations in  Sec. 960.3-1-5, to the extent practicable, and diversity of rock types  in Sec. 960.3-1-2, if the circumstances so apply. If less than five  geohydrologic settings are available for consideration, the above  process shall be used to select two or more preferred sites from those  settings that contain more than one potentially acceptable site, as  required to obtain the number of sites to be nominated as suitable for  characterization. For purposes of the second and subsequent  repositories, due consideration shall also be given to the siting  provision for regionality as specified in Sec. 960.3-1-3. Fourth, each  preferred site within a geohydrologic setting shall be evaluated as to  whether such site is suitable for the development of a repository under  the qualifying condition of each guideline specified in subparts C and D  that does not require site characterization as a prerequisite for the  application of such guideline. The guidelines considered appropriate to  this evaluation have been selected on the basis of their exclusion under  the definition of site characterization as specified in Sec. 960.2.  Although the final application of these guidelines, in accordance with  the provisions set forth in appendix III of this part, does not require  geologic data from site-characterization activities, such application  will require additional data beyond those specified in appendix IV of  this part, which will be obtained concurrently with site  characterization. Such guidelines include those specified in Sec. 960.4- 2-8-2 (Site Ownership and Control) of subpart C; Secs. 960.5-1(a)(1) and  960.5-1(a)(2) of subpart D (preclosure system guidelines for  radiological safety and environmental quality, socioeconomics, and  transportation); and Secs. 960.5-2-1 through 960.5-2-7 of subpart D  (Population Density and Distribution, Site Ownership and Control,  Meteorology, Offsite Installations and Operations, Environmental  Quality, Socioeconomic Impacts, and Transportation). This evaluation  shall consider on balance those favorable conditions and potentially  adverse conditions identified as such at a preferred site in relation to  the qualifying condition of each such guideline. For each such  guideline, this evaluation shall focus on the suitability of the site  for the development of a repository by considering the activities from  the start of site characterization through decommissioning and shall  support a finding by the DOE in accordance with the application  requirements set forth in appendix III of this part. Fifth, each  preferred site within a geohydrologic setting shall be evaluated as to  whether such site is suitable for site characterization under the  qualifying conditions of those guidelines specified in subparts C and D  that require characterization (i.e., subsurface geologic, hydrologic,  and geochemical data gathering). Such guidelines include those specified  in Sec. 960.4-1(a) (postclosure system guideline); Secs. 960.4-2-1  through 960.4-2-8-1 of subpart C (Geohydrology, Geochemistry, Rock  Characteristics, Climatic Changes, Erosion, Dissolution, Tectonics,  Human Interference, and Natural Resources); Sec. 960.5-1(a)(3)  (preclosure system guideline for ease and cost of siting, construction,  operation, and closure); and Sec. 960.5-2-8 through 960.5-2-11 of  subpart D (Surface Characteristics, Rock Characteristics,   Hydrology, and Tectonics). This evaluation shall consider on balance the  favorable conditions and potentially adverse conditions identified as  such at a preferred site in relation to the qualifying condition of each  such guideline. For each such guideline, this evaluation shall focus on  the suitability of the site for characterization and shall support a  finding by the DOE in accordance with the application requirements set  forth in appendix III of this part.</p>
