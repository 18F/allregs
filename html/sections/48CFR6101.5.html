The Board may, on motion, in its discretion, permit a special or limited appearance, such as by an amicus curiae. Permission to appear, if granted, will be for such purposes and in such manner as allowed by the presiding judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of appearance. Unless a notice of appearance is filed by some other person, the person signing the notice of appeal, petition, or application shall be deemed to have appeared on behalf of the appellant, petitioner, or applicant, and the head of the respondent agency's litigation office shall be deemed to have appeared on behalf of the respondent. Other attorneys actively participating in the proceedings before the Board must file notices of appearance. A notice of appearance in the form specified in the appendix to the rules of this chapter is sufficient. Attorneys representing parties before the Board are required to list the state bars to which they are admitted and their state bar numbers or other bar identifiers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of appearance. Any person who has filed a notice of appearance and who wishes to withdraw from a case must file a motion which includes the name, address, telephone number, facsimile machine number, and e-mail address, if available, of the person who will assume responsibility for representation of the party in question. The motion shall state the grounds for withdrawal unless it is accompanied by a representation from the successor representative or existing co-counsel that the established case schedule will be met.
