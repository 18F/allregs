                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prudent contract financing can be a useful working tool in  Government acquisition by expediting the performance of essential  contracts. Contracting officers must consider the criteria in this part  in determining whether to include contract financing in solicitations  and contracts. Resolve reasonable doubts by including contract financing  in the solicitation. The contracting officer must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide Government financing only to the extent actually needed  for prompt and efficient performance, considering the availability of  private financing and the probable impact on working capital of the  predelivery expenditures and production lead-times associated with the  contract, or groups of contracts or orders (e.g., issued under  indefinite-delivery contracts, basic ordering agreements, or their  equivalent);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administer contract financing so as to aid, not impede, the  acquisition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Avoid any undue risk of monetary loss to the Government through  the financing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include the form of contract financing deemed to be in the  Government's best interest in the solicitation (see 32.106 and 32.113);  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitor the contractor's use of the contract financing provided  and the contractor's financial status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the contractor is a small business concern, the contracting  officer must give special attention to meeting the contractor's contract  financing need. However, a contractor's receipt of a certificate of  competency from the Small Business Administration has no bearing on the  contractor's need for or entitlement to contract financing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to specific agency regulations and paragraph (d) of this  section, the contracting officer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May provide customary contract financing in accordance with  32.113; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must not provide unusual contract financing except as authorized  in 32.114.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise authorized by agency procedures, the  contracting officer may provide contract financing in the form of  performance-based payments (see subpart 32.10) or customary progress  payments (see subpart 32.5) if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Will not be able to bill for the first delivery of products for  a substantial time after work must begin (normally 4 months or more for  small business concerns, and 6 months or more for others), and will make  expenditures for contract performance during the predelivery period that  have a significant impact on the contractor's working capital; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrates actual financial need or the unavailability of  private financing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the contractor is not a small business concern--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an individual contract, the contract price is $2.5 million  or more; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an indefinite-delivery contract, a basic ordering agreement  or a similar ordering instrument, the contracting officer expects the  aggregate value of orders or contracts that individually exceed the  simplified acquisition threshold to have a total value of $2.5 million  or more. The contracting officer must limit financing to those orders or  contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the contractor is a small business concern--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an individual contract, the contract price exceeds the  simplified acquisition threshold; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an indefinite-delivery contract, a basic ordering agreement  or a similar ordering instrument, the contracting officer expects the  aggregate value of orders or contracts to exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold.
