                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions in Sec.  42.2, the following definitions apply to proceedings under this subpart D:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Covered business method patent means a patent that claims a method or corresponding apparatus for performing data processing or other operations used in the practice, administration, or management of a financial product or service, except that the term does not include patents for technological inventions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technological invention. In determining whether a patent is for a technological invention solely for purposes of the Transitional Program for Covered Business Methods (section 42.301(a)), the following will be considered on a case-by-case basis: whether the claimed subject matter as a whole recites a technological feature that is novel and unobvious over the prior art; and solves a technical problem using a technical solution.
