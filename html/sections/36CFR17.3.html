                            <p class="depth0">The Act is applicable to any Federally owned real property acquired  by the Secretary from non-Federal sources within any unit of the  National Park System other than national parks and those national  monuments of scientific significance. No leasehold or freehold  conveyance shall be made except as to lands which the General Management  Plan for the particular unit of the National Park System has designated  as a Special Use Zone for the uses that are permitted by the freehold or  leasehold conveyance. No leasehold or freehold conveyance shall be made  unless the lands have been surveyed for natural, historical, and  cultural values and a determination made by the Secretary that such  leasehold or freehold conveyance will not be inconsistent with any  natural, historical, or cultural values found on the land. Any  conveyances affecting properties listed or eligible for listing on the  National Register of Historic Places must be reviewed by the Advisory  Council on Historic Preservation. Procedures for obtaining the Council's  comments appear at 36 CFR part 800, ``Procedures for the Protection of  Historic and Cultural Resources.''
