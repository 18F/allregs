                            <p class="depth0">Consistent with HHS' objectives of competition and support of the small business program, Contracting Officers shall not award contracts solely on the basis of an organization's ability or willingness to cost-share. Contracting Officers shall make awards primarily on the contractor's competence and only after adequate competition has been obtained among large and small business organizations, whenever possible. An offeror's willingness to share costs is not a technical evaluation consideration, but a business consideration, which is secondary to selecting the best qualified source.</p>
