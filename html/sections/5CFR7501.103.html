Each waiver shall be in writing and supported by a  statement of the facts and findings upon which it is based and may  impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring the employee's  execution of a written disqualification statement. A waiver will be  considered only in response to a written waiver request submitted to an  agency ethics official. The waiver request should include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requesting employee's Branch, Unit, and a detailed  description of his or her official duties;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The nature and extent of the proposed waiver;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A detailed statement of the facts supporting the request; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The basis for the request, such as undue hardship or other  exigent circumstances.</p>
