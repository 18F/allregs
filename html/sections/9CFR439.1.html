                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accreditation--Determination by FSIS that a laboratory is  qualified to analyze official samples of raw or processed meat and  poultry products, because it has met the requirements for accreditation  specified in this part, for the presence and amount of all four food  chemistry analytes (protein, moisture, fat, and salt); or a  determination by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official  samples of raw or processed meat and poultry products, because it has  met the requirements for accreditation in this part, for the presence  and amount of a specified chemical residue of any one of several classes  of chemical residues. A laboratory may hold more than one accreditation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accredited laboratory--A non-Federal analytical laboratory that  has met the requirements for accreditation specified in this Part and,  therefore, at an establishment's discretion, may be used in lieu of an  FSIS laboratory for analyzing official regulatory samples. Payment for  the analysis of official samples is to be made by the establishment  using the accredited laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP)--The FSIS program in which  non-Federal laboratories are accredited as eligible to perform analyses  on official regulatory samples of raw or processed meat and poultry  products, and through which a check sample program for quality assurance  is conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Chemical residue misidentification--see ``Correct chemical  residue identification'' definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coefficient of variation (CV)--The standard deviation of a  distribution of analytical values multiplied by 100 and divided by the  mean of those values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Comparison mean--The average result, for a sample, obtained from  all submitted results that have a large deviation measure of zero. When  only two laboratories perform the analysis and the large deviation  measure is not zero, alternative procedures for establishing a  comparison mean may be employed by FSIS. For purposes of computing the  comparison mean, a laboratory's ``result'' for a food chemistry analyte  is the obtained analytical value; a laboratory's ``result'' for a  chemical residue is the logarithmic transformation of the obtained  analytical value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Correct chemical residue identification--Reporting by a  laboratory of the presence and analytical value of a chemical residue  that was included in the ALP check sample above the minimum reporting  level. Failure of a laboratory to report the presence of such a chemical  residue is considered a misidentification. In addition, reporting the  presence of and analytical value for a residue that was not included in  the ALP check sample above the minimum reporting level is considered a  misidentification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CUSUM--A class of statistical procedures for assessing whether  or not a process is ``in control.'' Each CUSUM value is constructed by  accumulating incremental values obtained from observed results of the  process, and then determined to either exceed or fall within acceptable  limits for that process. The initial CUSUM values for each laboratory  whose application for accreditation is accepted are set at zero. The  CUSUM values are reset to zero at the beginning of each year; that is,  the CUSUM values associated with the first maintenance check sample each  year are set equal to the CUSUM increment for that sample. The four  CUSUM procedures are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Positive systematic laboratory difference CUSUM (CUSUM-P)-- monitors how consistently an accredited laboratory gets numerically  greater results than the comparison mean;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Negative systematic laboratory difference CUSUM (CUSUM-N)-- monitors how consistently an accredited laboratory gets numerically  smaller results than the comparison mean;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Variability CUSUM (CUSUM-V)--monitors the average ``total  deviation'' (i.e., the combination of the random fluctuations and  systematic differences) between an accredited laboratory's results and  the comparison mean; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Individual large deviation CUSUM (CUSUM-D)--monitors the  magnitude and frequency of large differences between the results of an  accredited laboratory and the comparison mean.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Food chemistry--For the purposes of part 439, ``food chemistry''  will refer to analysis of raw or processed meat or poultry products for  the analytes moisture, protein, fat, and salt. All four analytes must be  determined when a food chemistry analysis is conducted, unless otherwise  advised by the ALP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Individual large deviation--An analytical result that differs  from the sample comparison mean by more than would be expected assuming  normal laboratory variability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Initial accreditation check sample--A sample provided by the ALP  to a non-Federal laboratory to determine whether the laboratory's  analytical capability meets the standards for granting accreditation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Inter-laboratory accreditation maintenance check sample--A  sample provided by FSIS to an accredited laboratory to assist in  determining whether the laboratory is maintaining acceptable levels of  analytical capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Large deviation measure--A measure that quantifies an  unacceptably large difference between a laboratory's analytical result  and the sample comparison mean.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Minimum proficiency level (MPL)--The minimum concentration of a  residue at which an analytical result will be used to assess a  laboratory's quantification capability. This concentration is an  estimate of the smallest concentration for which the average coefficient  of variation (CV) for reproducibility (i.e., combined within and between  laboratory variability) does not exceed 20 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Minimum reporting level (MRL)--The number such that if any  obtained analytical value for a residue in a check sample or official  sample equals or exceeds this number, then the residue is reported  together with the obtained analytical value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Official sample--A sample selected by an inspector or inspection  service employee in accordance with FSIS procedures for regulatory use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Probation--The period commencing with official notification to  an accredited laboratory that its check sample results no longer satisfy  the performance requirements specified in this rule, and ending with  official notification that accreditation either is fully restored, is  suspended, or is revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> QA (See Quality assurance recovery).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> QC (See Quality control recovery).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Quality assurance (QA) recovery--The ratio of a laboratory's  analytical value for a check sample residue to the established level of  the analyte in the check sample, multiplied by 100. As dictated by the  procedures for the analyte, the analytical value may be adjusted prior  to the recovery computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Quality control (QC) recovery--The ratio of a laboratory's  analytical value of a quality control standard to the established level  of the analyte in the standard, multiplied by 100. As dictated by the  procedures for the analyte, the analytical value may be adjusted prior  to the recovery computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Refusal of accreditation--An action taken by FSIS when a  laboratory that is applying for accreditation is denied the  accreditation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Responsibly connected--Any individual, or entity, that is a  partner, officer, director, manager, or owner of 10 percent or more of  the voting stock of the applicant or recipient of accreditation or an  employee in a managerial or executive capacity or any employee who  conducts or supervises the chemical analysis of FSIS official samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Revocation of accreditation--An action taken by FSIS against a  laboratory, removing the laboratory's right to analyze official samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Standardizing constant--A number that results from a  mathematical adjustment to the ``standardizing value'' and is used to  compute the standardized difference for a check sample result. The  number takes into consideration the expected variance of the difference  between the accredited or applying laboratory's result(s) and the  comparison mean for a sample, the standardizing value, the correlation  and number of repeated results by a laboratory on a sample, and the  number of laboratories that analyzed a sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Standardized difference--The quotient of the difference between  a laboratory's result on a sample and the comparison mean of the sample  divided by the standardizing constant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em>.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Paragraph (aa)--Standardizing Values for Food Chemistry</p><p class="depth2">[By product class and analyte] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Fat \1\                               Salt \1\</p><p class="depth2">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Product/class                    Moisture     Protein \1\                                                                =4%</p><p class="depth2"><12.5%    =12.5%      <1%           1-4%             \2\ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cured Pork/Canned Ham.........................         0.50  0.060 (X 0.65)      0.26 (X   0.30 (X 0.25)           0.127  0.127 (X 0.25)           0.22</p><p class="depth2">0.25) Ground Beef...................................         0.71  0.060 (X 0.65)          N/A   0.35 (X 0.25)           0.127  0.127 (X 0.25)           0.22 Other Meat Products...........................         0.57  0.060 (X 0.65)      0.26 (X   0.30 (X 0.25)           0.127  0.127 (X 0.25)           0.22</p><p class="depth2">0.25) Poultry Products..............................         0.57  0.060 (X 0.65)      0.26 (X   0.30 (X 0.25)           0.127  0.127 (X 0.25)           0.22</p><p class="depth2">0.25) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The standardizing value is either the value given in the table or is computed by the formula set forth in the table, where X is the comparison mean</p><p class="depth2">of the sample.
