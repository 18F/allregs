                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For monthly benefits payable for months prior to January 1991, the  law provides that to be entitled to a widow's or widower's benefit as a  disabled widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse, you must have a  medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be  expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for  a continuous period of not less than 12 months. The impairment(s) must  have been of a level of severity to prevent a person from doing any  gainful activity. To determine whether you were disabled, we consider  only your physical or mental impairment(s). We do not consider your age,  education, and work experience. We also do not consider certain felony- related and prison-related impairments, as explained in Sec. 404.1506.  (For monthly benefits payable for months after December 1990, see  Sec. 404.1505(a).)
