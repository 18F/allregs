If service is made upon the respondent or his/her attorney or agent in person or by leaving the complaint at the office or place of business of the respondent, attorney, or agent, the verified return by the person making service, setting forth the manner of service, shall be proof of such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service of papers other than complaint. Any paper other than the complaint may be served upon the respondent as provided in paragraph (a) of this section or by mailing the paper by first-class mail to the respondent at the last address known to the Executive Director or by mailing the paper by first-class mail to the respondent's attorney or agent. Such mailing shall constitute complete service. Notices may also be served upon the respond- ent or his/her attorney or agent by telegraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing of papers. Whenever the filing of a paper is required or permitted
