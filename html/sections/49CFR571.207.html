                            <p class="depth0">S1. Purpose and scope. This standard establishes requirements for  seats, their attachment assemblies, and their installation to minimize  the possibility of their failure by forces acting on them as a result of  vehicle impact.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars,  multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses.</p><p class="depth0">S3. Definitions. Occupant seat means a seat that provides at least  one designated seating position.</p><p class="depth0">Seat adjuster means the part of the seat that provides forward and  rearward positioning of the seat bench and back, and/or rotation around  a vertical   axis, including any fixed portion, such as a seat track. In the case of  a seat equipped with seat adjusters at different levels, the term means  the uppermost seat adjuster.</p><p class="depth0">S4. Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">S4.1 Driver's seat. Each vehicle shall have an occupant seat for the  driver.</p><p class="depth0">S4.2. General performance requirements. When tested in accordance  with S5, each occupant seat shall withstand the following forces, in  newtons, except for: a side-facing seat; a passenger seat on a bus other  than a school bus; a passenger seat on a school bus with a GVWR greater  than 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds); and, a passenger seat on a school  bus with a GVWR less than or equal to 4,536 kg manufactured before  October 21, 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In any position to which it can be adjusted--20 times the mass  of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 applied in a forward  longitudinal direction;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any position to which it can be adjusted--20 times the mass  of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 applied in a rearward  longitudinal direction;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For a seat belt assembly attached to the seat--the force  specified in paragraph (a), if it is a forward facing seat, or paragraph  (b), if it is a rearward facing seat, in each case applied  simultaneously with the forces imposed on the seat by the seat belt  assembly when it is loaded in accordance with S4.2 of Sec. 571.210; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In its rearmost position--a force that produces a 373 newton  meters moment about the seating reference point for each designated  seating position that the seat provides, applied to the upper cross- member of the seat back or the upper seat back, in a rearward  longitudinal direction for forward-facing seats and in a forward  longitudinal direction for rearward-facing seats.</p><p class="depth0">S4.2.1 Seat adjustment. Except for vertical movement of nonlocking  suspension type occupant seats in trucks or buses, each seat shall  remain in its adjusted position when tested in accordance with the test  procedures specified in S5.</p><p class="depth0">S4.3. Restraining device for hinged or folding seats or seat backs.  Except for a passenger seat in a bus or a seat having a back that is  adjustable only for the comfort of its occupants, a hinged or folding  occupant seat or occupant seat back shall--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Be equipped with a self-locking device for restraining the  hinged or folding seat or seat back, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there are any designated seating positions or auxiliary  seating accommodations behind the seat, either immediately to the rear  or to the sides, be equipped with a control for releasing that  restraining device.</p><p class="depth0">S4.3.1 Accessibility of release control. If there is a designated  seating position immediately behind a seat equipped with a restraining  device, the control for releasing the device shall be readily accessible  to the occupant of the seat equipped with the device and, if access to  the control is required in order to exit from the vehicle, to the  occupant of the designated seating position immediately behind the seat.</p><p class="depth0">S4.3.2 Performance of restraining device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Once engaged, the restraining device for  a forward-facing seat shall not release or fail when a forward  longitudinal force, in newtons, equal to 20 times the mass of the hinged  or folding portion of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 is applied  through the center of gravity of that portion of the seat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once engaged, the restraining device for a rearward-facing seat  shall not release or fail when a rearward longitudinal force, in  newtons, equal to 8 times the mass of the hinged or folding portion of  the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 is applied through the center of  gravity of that portion of the seat.</p><p class="depth0">S4.3.2.2 Acceleration. Once engaged, the restraining device shall  not release or fail when the device is subjected to an acceleration of  20 g., in the longitudinal direction opposite to that in which the seat  folds.</p><p class="depth0">S4.4 Labeling. Seats not designated for occupancy while the vehicle  is in motion shall be conspicuously labeled to that effect.</p><p class="depth0">S5. Test procedures.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Apply the forces specified in S4.2(a) and S4.2(b) as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em>, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that  is above the seat adjuster or that passes through any part of the  adjuster, use, at the manufacturer's option, either S5.1.1(b) or, if  physically possible, S5.1.1(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a seat specified in S5.1.1(a)(1) for which it is not  physically possible to follow the procedure in S5.1.1(c), use S5.1.1(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that  is below the seat adjuster, use S5.1.1(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For all other seats whose seat back and seat bench are attached  to the vehicle by the same attachments, use S5.1.1(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> horizontally through the rigid cross- member as shown in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Find ``cg1,'' the center of gravity of the portion of  the seat that is above the lowest surface of the seat adjuster. On each  side of the seat, secure a strut from a point on the outside of the seat  frame in the horizontal plane of cg1 to a point on the frame  as far forward as possible of the seat adjusted position. Between the  upper ends of the struts attach a rigid cross-member, in front of the  seat back frame for rearward loading and behind the seat back frame for  forward loading. Find ``cg2,'' the center of gravity of the  portion of the seat that is below the seat adjuster. Apply a force  horizontally through cg1 equal to 20 times the weight of the  portion of the seat represented by cg1, and simultaneously  apply a force horizontally through cg2 equal to 20 times the  weight of the portion of the seat represented by cg2.</p><p class="depth2">S5.1.2 If the seat back and the seat bench are attached to the  vehicle by different attachments, attach to each component a fixture  capable of transmitting a force to that component. Apply forces, in  newtons, equal to 20 times the mass of the seat back in kilograms  multiplied by 9.8 m/s\2\ horizontally through the center of gravity of  the seat back, as shown in Figure 2 and apply forces, in newtons, equal  to 20 times the mass of the seat bench in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 m/ s\2\ horizontally through the center of gravity of the seat bench, as  shown in Figure 3.</p><p class="depth2">S5.2 Develop the moment specified in S4.2(d) as shown in Figure 4.</p><p class="depth2">S5.3 Apply the forces specified in S4.3.2.1(a) and (b) to a hinged  or folding seat as shown in Figure 1 and to a hinged or folding seat  back as shown in Figure 5.</p><p class="depth2">S5.4 Determine the center of gravity of a seat or seat component  with all cushions and upholstery in place and with the head restraint in  its fully extended design position.
