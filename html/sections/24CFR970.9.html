PHAs must consult with residents who will  be affected by the proposed action with respect to all demolition or  disposition applications. The PHA must provide with its application  evidence that the application was developed in consultation with  residents who will be affected by the proposed action, any resident  organizations for the development, PHA-wide resident organizations that  will be affected by the demolition or disposition, and the Resident  Advisory Board (RAB). The PHA must also submit copies of any written  comments submitted to the PHA and any evaluation that the PHA has made  of the comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Resident organization offer to sell--applicability. In the  situation where the PHA applies to dispose of a development or portion  of a development:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA shall, in appropriate circumstances as determined by the  Assistant Secretary, initially offer the property proposed for  disposition to any eligible resident organization, eligible resident  management corporation as defined in 24 CFR part 964, or to a nonprofit  organization acting on behalf of the residents at any development  proposed for disposition, if the resident entity has expressed an  interest in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income  housing. The entity must make the request in writing to the PHA, no  later than 30 days after the resident entity has received the  notification of sale from the PHA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the resident entity has expressed an interest in purchasing  the property for continued use as low-income housing, the entity, in  order for   its purchase offer to be considered, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a nonprofit organization, be acting on behalf of  the residents of the development; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate that it has obtained a firm commitment for the  necessary financing within 60 days of serving its written notice of  interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirements of this section do not apply to the following  cases, which have been determined not to present an appropriate  opportunity for purchase by a resident organization:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A unit of state or local government requests to acquire vacant  land that is less than two acres in order to build or expand its public  services (a local government wishes to use the land to build or  establish a police substation); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A PHA seeks disposition outside the public housing program to  privately finance or otherwise develop a facility to benefit low-income  families (e.g., day care center, administrative building, mixed-finance  housing under 24 CFR part 941 subpart F, or other types of low-income  housing);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Units that have been legally vacated in accordance with the  HOPE VI program, the regulations at 24 CFR part 971, or the mandatory  conversion regulations at 24 CFR part 972, excluding developments where  the PHA has consolidated vacancies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Distressed units required to be converted to tenant-based  assistance under section 33 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Disposition of non-dwelling properties, including administration  and community buildings, and maintenance facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the requirements of this section are not applicable, as  provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the PHA may proceed to  submit to HUD its application under this part to dispose of the  property, or a portion of the property, without affording an opportunity  for purchase by a resident organization. However, PHAs must consult with  their residents in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The  PHA must submit documentation with date and signatures to support the  applicability of one of the exceptions in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section. Examples of appropriate documentation include, but are not  limited to: a letter from the public body that wants to acquire the  land, copies of memoranda or letters approving the PHA's previous  application under part 970 or mandatory conversion plan, and the HUD  transmittal document approving the proposed revitalization plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Established eligible organizations. Where there are eligible  resident organizations, eligible resident management corporations as  defined in 24 CFR part 964, or nonprofit organizations acting on behalf  of the residents as defined in 24 CFR part 964 (collectively,  ``established eligible organizations''), that have expressed an  interest, in writing, to the PHA within 30 days of the date of  notification of the proposed sale, in purchasing the property for  continued use as low-income housing at the affected development, the PHA  shall follow the procedures for making the offer described in Sec.  970.11.
