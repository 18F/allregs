                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The schedule of fees for applications and other filings (Bureau/ Office Fee Filing Guides) lists those applications and other filings  that must be accompanied by an FCC Form 159, Remittance Advice' or the  electronic version of the form, FCC Form 159-E, one of the forms that is  automatically generated when an applicant accesses the Commission's on- line filing and payment process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicants may access the Commission's on-line filing (http:// www.fcc.gov/e-file.html) and fee payment program by accessing (http:// www.fcc.gov/feefiler.html). Applicants who use the on-line process will  be directed to the appropriate electronic application and payment forms  for completion and submission of the required application(s) and payment  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications and other filings that are not submitted in  accordance with these instructions will be returned as unprocessable.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth2">This requirement for the simultaneous submission of fee forms with  applications or other filings does not apply to the payment of fees for  which the Commission has established a billing process. See Sec. 1.1121  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications returned to applicants for additional information  or corrections will not require an additional fee when resubmitted,  unless the additional information results in an increase of the original  fee amount. Those applications not requiring an additional fee should be  resubmitted directly to the Bureau/Office requesting the additional  information. The original fee will be forfeited if the additional  information or corrections are not resubmitted to the appropriate  Bureau/Office by the prescribed deadline. A forfeited application fee  will not be refunded. If an additional fee is required, the original fee  will be returned and the application must be resubmitted with a new  remittance in the amount of the required fee to the Commission's lockbox  bank. Applicants should attach a copy of the Commission's request for  additional or corrected information to their resubmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Bureau/Office staff discovers within 30 days after the  resubmission that the required fee was not submitted, the application  will be dismissed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If after 30 days the Bureau/Office staff discovers the required  fee has not been paid, the application will be retained and a 25 percent  late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission  has completed its action on the application. Any Commission actions  taken prior to timely payment of these charges are contingent and  subject to recession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Should the staff change the status of an application, resulting  in an increase in the fee due, the applicant will be billed for the  remainder under the conditions established by Sec. 1.1118(b) of the  rules.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth2">Due to the statutory requirements applicable to tariff filings, the  procedures for handling tariff filings may vary from the procedures set  out in the rules.
