Sec.  141.64 and 141.65, respectively,  and must meet the treatment technique requirements for disinfection  byproduct precursors in Sec.  141.135.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulations in this subpart establish criteria under which  transient NCWSs that use chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant  must modify their practices to meet the MRDL for chlorine dioxide in  Sec.  141.65.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EPA has established MCLs for TTHM and HAA5 and treatment  technique requirements for disinfection byproduct precursors to limit  the levels of known and unknown disinfection byproducts which may have  adverse health effects. These disinfection byproducts may include  chloroform; bromodichloromethane; dibromochloromethane; bromoform;  dichloroacetic acid; and trichloroacetic acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance dates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CWSs and NTNCWSs. Unless otherwise noted,  systems must comply with the requirements of this subpart as follows.  Subpart H systems serving 10,000 or more persons must comply with this  subpart beginning January 1, 2002. Subpart H systems serving fewer than  10,000 persons and systems using only ground water not under the direct  influence of surface water must comply with this subpart beginning  January 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transient NCWSs. Subpart H systems serving 10,000 or more  persons and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must  comply with any requirements for chlorine dioxide in this subpart  beginning January 1, 2002. Subpart H systems serving fewer than 10,000  persons and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant and  systems using only ground water not under the direct influence of  surface water and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant  must comply with any requirements for chlorine dioxide in this subpart  beginning January 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each CWS and NTNCWS regulated under paragraph (a) of this  section must be operated by qualified personnel who meet the  requirements specified by the State and are included in a State register  of qualified operators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Control of disinfectant residuals. Notwithstanding the MRDLs in  Sec.  141.65, systems may increase residual disinfectant levels in the  distribution system of chlorine or chloramines (but not chlorine  dioxide) to a level and for a time necessary to protect public health,  to address specific microbiological contamination problems caused by  circumstances such as, but not limited to, distribution line breaks,  storm run-off events, source water contamination events, or cross- connection events.
