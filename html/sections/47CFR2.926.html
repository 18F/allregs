See Sec. 2.925.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grantee code assigned pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section is assigned permanently to applicants/grantees and is valid only for the party

The format for this code will be specified by the Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology. A prospective grantee or its authorized representative may receive a grantee code electronically via the Internet at http://www.fcc.gov/eas. The code may be obtained at any time prior to submittal of the application for equipment authorization. However, the fee required by Sec. 1.1103 of this chapter must be submitted and validated within 30 days of the issuance of the grantee code, or the code will be removed from the Commission's records and a new grantee code will have to be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After assignment of a grantee code each grantee will continue to use the same grantee code for subsequent equipment authorization applications.

This shall not prohibit placement of an FCC identifier on a transceiver which includes a verified receiver subject to Sec. 15.101 of this chapter, provided that the transmitter portion of such transceiver is covered by a valid grant of type acceptance or certification. The FCC Identifier is uniquely assigned to the grantee and may not be placed on the equipment without authorization by the grantee. See Sec. 2.803 for conditions applicable to the display at trade shows of equipment which has not been granted equipment authorization where such grant is required prior to marketing. Labelling of such equipment may include model or type numbers, but shall not include a purported FCC Identifier.
