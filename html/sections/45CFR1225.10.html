To the extent possible, a Volunteer will be placed in the same position previously held. However, reassignment to the specific country of prior service, or to the specific position previously held, is contingent on several programmatic considerations such as the continued availability of the position, or program in that country, and acceptance by the host country of such placement. If the same position is deemed to be no longer available, the aggrieved party will be offered a reassignment to a position in as similar circumstances to the position previously held, or to resign from service for reasons beyond his or her control. Such a reassignment may require both additional training and an additional two year commitment to volunteer service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provision for reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred by the aggrieved party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Such other relief as may be deemed appropriate by the Director of Peace Corps or ACTION.</p>
