                                Sec. 1.132-1  Exclusion from gross income for certain fringe
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Gross income does not include any fringe benefit  which qualifies as a--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No-additional-cost service,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified employee discount,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Working condition fringe, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> De minimis fringe.  Special rules apply with respect to certain on-premises gyms and other  athletic facilities (Sec. 1.132-1(e)), demonstration use of employer- provided automobiles by full-time automobile salesmen (Sec. 1.132- 5(o)), parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises  of the employer (Sec. 1.132-5(p)), and on-premises eating facilities  (Sec. 1.132-7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of employee--(1) No-additional-cost services and  qualified employee discounts. For purposes of section 132(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  (relating to no-additonal-cost services) and section 132(a)(2) (relating  to qualified employee discounts), the term ``employee'' (with respect to  a line of business of an employer means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is currently employed by the employer in the  line of business,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual who was formerly employed by the employer in the  line of business and who separated from service with the employer in the  line of business by reason of retirement or disability, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section) will be treated as use by the  employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Working condition fringes. For purposes of section 132(a)(3)  (relating to working condition fringes), the term ``employee'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is currently employed by the employer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any partner who performs services for the partnership,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any director of the employer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any independent contractor who performs services for the  employer.  Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (b)(2) to the contrary, an  independent contractor who performs services for the employer cannot  exclude the value of parking or the use of consumer goods provided  pursuant to a product testing program under Sec. 1.132-5(n); in  addition, any director of the employer cannot exclude the value of the  use of consumer goods provided pursuant to a product testing program  under Sec. 1.132-5(n).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On-premises athletic facilities. For purposes of section  132(h)(5) (relating to on-premises athletic facilities), the term  ``employee'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is currently employed by the employer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual who was formerly employed by the employer and  who separated from service with the employer by reason of retirement or  disability, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any widow or widower of an individual who died while employed  by the employer or who separated from service with the employer by  reason of retirement or disability.  For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), any partner who performs services  for a partnership is considered employed by the partnership. In  addition, any use by the spouse or dependent child (as defined in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section) of the employee will be treated as use  by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> (relating  to de minimis fringes), the term ``employee'' means any recipient of a  fringe benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dependent child. The term ``dependent child'' means any son,  stepson, daughter, or stepdaughter of the employee who is a dependent of  the employee, or both of whose parents are deceased and who has not  attained age 25. Any child to whom section 152(e) applies will be  treated as the dependent of both parents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> does not change  the other requirements for an exclusion, such as the line of business  requirement. Thus, for example, if a controlled group of corporations  consists of two corporations that operate in different lines of  business, the corporations are not treated as operating in the same line  of business even though the corporations are treated as one employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Customers not to include employees. For purposes of section 132  and the regulations thereunder, the term ``customer'' means any customer  who is not an employee. However, the preceding sentence does not apply  to section 132(c)(2) (relating to the gross profit percentage for  determining a qualified employee discount). Thus, an employer that  provides employee discounts cannot exclude sales made to employees in  determining the aggregate sales to customers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of on-premises athletic facilities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Gross income does not include the value of any on-premises athletic  facility provided by an employer to its employees. For purposes of  section 132(h)(5) and this paragraph (e), the term ``on-premises  athletic facility'' means any gym or other athletic facility (such as a  pool, tennis court, or golf course)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Which is located on the premises of the employer, (ii) Which is  operated by the employer, and (iii) Substantially all of the use of  which during the calendar year is by employees of the employer, their  spouses, and their dependent children.  For purposes of paragraph (e) (1) (iii) of this section, the term  ``dependent children'' has the same meaning as the plural of the term  ``dependent child'' in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The exclusion  of this paragraph (e) does not apply to any athletic facility if access  to the facility is made available to the general public through the sale  of memberships, the rental of the facility, or a similar arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Premises of the employer. The athletic facility need not be  located on the   employer's business premises. However, the athletic facility must be  located on premises of the employer. The exclusion provided in this  paragraph (e) applies whether the premises are owned or leased by the  employer; in addition, the exclusion is available even if the employer  is not a named lessee on the lease so long as the employer pays  reasonable rent. The exclusion provided in this paragraph (e) does not  apply to any athletic facility that is a facility for residential use.  Thus, for example, a resort with accompanying athletic facilities (such  as tennis courts, pool, and gym) would not qualify for the exclusion  provided in this paragraph (e). An athletic facility is considered to be  located on the employer's premises if the facility is located on the  premises of a voluntary employees' beneficiary association funded by the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of rules to membership in an athletic facility. The  exclusion provided in this paragraph (e) does not apply to any  membership in an athletic facility (including health clubs or country  clubs) unless the facility is owned (or leased) and operated by the  employer and substantially all the use of the facility is by employees  of the employer, their spouses, and their dependent children. Therefore,  membership in a health club or country club not meeting the rules  provided in this paragraph (e) would not qualify for the exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operation by the employer. An employer is considered to operate  the athletic facility if the employer operates the facility through its  own employees, or if the employer contracts out to another to operate  the athletic facility. For example, if an employer hires an independent  contractor to operate the athletic facility for the employer's  employees, the facility is considered to be operated by the employer. In  addition, if an athletic facility is operated by more than one employer,  it is considered to be operated by each employer. For purposes of  paragraph (e) (1) (iii) of this section, substantially all of the use of  a facility that is operated by more than one employer must be by  employees of the various employers, their spouses, and their dependent  children. Where the facility is operated by more than one employer, an  employer that pays rent either directly to the owner of the premises or  to a sublessor of the premises is eligible for the exclusion. If an  athletic facility is operated by a voluntary employees' beneficiary  association funded by an employer, the employer is considered to operate  the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules. The  nondiscrimination rules of section 132 and Sec. 1.132-8 do not apply to  on-premises athletic facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Nonapplicability of section 132 in certain cases--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax  treatment provided for in another section. If the tax treatment or a  particular fringe benefit is expressly provided for in another section  of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, section 132 and the  applicable regulations (except for section 132 (e) and the regulations  thereunder) do not apply to such fringe benefit. For example, because  section 129 provides an exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or  incurred by an employer for dependent care assistance for an employee,  the exclusions under section 132 and this section do not apply to the  provision by an employer to an employee of dependent care assistance.  Similarly, because section 117 (d) applies to tuition reductions, the  exclusions under section 132 do not apply to free or discounted tuition  provided to an employee by an organization operated by the employer,  whether the tuition is for study at or below the graduate level. Of  course, if the amounts paid by the employer are for education relating  to the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer  so that, if the employee paid for the education, the amount paid could  be deducted under section 162, the costs of the education may be  eligible for exclusion as a working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limited statutory exclusions. If another section of Chapter 1 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides an exclusion from gross  income based on the cost of the benefit provided to the employee and  such exclusion is a limited amount, section 132 and the regulations  thereunder may apply to the extent the cost of the benefit exceeds the  statutory exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. Sections 1.132-0, 1.132-1, 1.132-2, 1.132-3,  1.132-4, 1.132-5,   1.132-6, 1.132-7 and 1.132-8 are effective as of January 1, 1989, except  that Sec. Sec. 1.132-1(b)(1) with respect to the use of air  transportation by a parent of an employee and 1.132-4(d) are effective  as of January 1, 1985. Furthermore, in Sec. 1.132-5, the eleventh  sentence of paragraph (m)(1), Examples 6 and 7 in paragraph (m)(8), and  paragraphs (m)(2)(i), (m)(2)(v), (m)(3)(iv), (m)(6), (m)(7), and (r) are  effective December 30, 1992; however, taxpayers may treat the rules as  applicable to benefits provided on or after January 1, 1989. For the  applicable rules relating to employer-provided transportation for  security concerns prior to December 30, 1992, see Sec. 1.132-5(m) (as  contained in 26 CFR part 1 (Sec. Sec. 1.61 to 1.169) revised April 1,  1992). See Sec. Sec. 1.132-1T, 1.132-2T, 1.132-3T, 1.132-4T, 1.132-5T,  1.132-6T, 1.132-7T and 1.132-8T for rules in effect for benefits  received from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1988.

Gross income does not include any fringe benefit  which qualifies as a--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No-additional-cost service,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified employee discount,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Working condition fringe, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> De minimis fringe.  Special rules apply with respect to certain on-premises gyms and other  athletic facilities (Sec. 1.132-1T(e)), demonstration use of employer- provided automobiles by full-time automobile salesmen (Sec. 1.132- 1T(n)), parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises  of the employer (Sec. 1.132-5T(o)), and on-premises eating facilities  (Sec. 1.132-7T).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of employee--(1) No-additional-cost services and  qualified employee discounts. For purposes of section 132(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  (relating to no-additional-cost services) and section 132(a)(2)  (relating to qualified employee discounts), the term ``employee'' (with  respect to a line of business of an employer) means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is currently employed by the employer in the  line of business,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual who was formerly employed by the employer in the  line of business and who separated from service with the employer in the  line of business by reason of retirement or disability, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any widow or widower of an individual who died while employed  by the employer in the line of business or who separated from service  with the employer in the line of business by reason of retirement or  disability.  For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), any partner who performs services  for a partnership is considered employed by the partnership. In  addition, any use by the spouse or dependent child (as defined in this  paragraph (b)) of the employee will be treated as use by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  (relating to working condition fringes), the term ``employee'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is currently employed by the employer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any partner who performs services for the partnership,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any director of the employer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any independent contractor who performs services for the  employer.  Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (b)(2) to the contrary, any  independent contractor who performs services for the employer cannot  exclude the value of parking or the use of consumer goods provided  pursuant to a product testing program under Sec. 1.132-5T (n); in  addition, any director of the employer cannot exclude the value of the  use of consumer goods provided pursuant to a product testing program  under Sec. 1.132-5T (n).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> De minimis fringe. For purpose of section 132(a)(4) (relating to  de minimis fringes), the term ``employee'' means any recipient of a  fringe benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dependent child. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term  ``dependent child'' means any son, stepson, daughter or stepdaughter of  the employee who is a dependent of the employee, or both of whose  parents are deceased.
