                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Design. In the determination of the adequacy of the lamp, with  respect to design, the following points will be considered: (1) The  materials used; (2) construction; (3) weight; (4) amount of light; (5)  distribution of light; and (6) exclusion of dust from the headpiece. The  suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by  preliminary inspection, by dropping tests, \1\ by durability tests of  the cord and cord armor, \2\ and by the general behavior of the lamp  equipment during the investigation. The amount and distribution of the  light shall be judged both by observation of the illumination on a white  screen and by photometric measurements. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Batteries are dropped 3 feet, at least 20 times onto an oak  floor. Headpieces are dropped 6 feet, at least 20 times, onto concrete.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Ten cords, assembled with the cord armor and outlet of the lamp  with which it is to be used, are slatted at least 100,000 times through  an arc of 50 degrees at approximately 90 slattings per minute. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Angle of light beam. MSHA recommends that the angle of the light  beam be at least 130 degrees horizontally to insure that the contrast  edge of the beam is away from the more sensitive sector of the wearer's  vision; however, to allow for manufacturing and assembly tolerances and  the use of multiple filament bulbs, MSHA will approve lamps giving a  minimum beam angle of 120 degrees. If the bulb has more than one major  filament, the one giving the smaller angle will be used in the  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Light distribution, visual. Excepting special headpieces for  inspection purposes, the area illuminated by the beam shall be free from  sharp gradations in light intensity and spectral shadows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Light distribution, photometric. (1) Excepting special  headpieces for inspection purposes, the maximum candlepower of the light  beam shall not be greater than 25 times the average or mean candlepower  of the beam. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The minimum allowable angle of 120 degrees will be used in  determining the mean candlepower of the beam. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The minimum candlepower of the beam based upon readings at the  design voltage of the bulb shall not be less than 1.</p>
