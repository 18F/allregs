                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A bank must, to the extent practicable, keep the  area where the bank conducts transactions involving insurance products  or annuities physically segregated from areas where retail deposits are  routinely accepted from the general public, identify the areas where  insurance product or annuity sales activities occur, and clearly  delineate and distinguish those areas from the areas where the bank's  retail deposit-taking activities occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referrals. Any person who accepts deposits from the public in an  area where such transactions are routinely conducted in the bank may  refer a consumer who seeks to purchase an insurance product or annuity  to a qualified person who sells that product only if the person making  the referral receives no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed  dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the  referral results in a transaction.</p>
