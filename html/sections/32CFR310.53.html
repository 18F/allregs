                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If a match is to be conducted internally within DoD, a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) shall be prepared. It shall contain  the same elements as a CMA, except as otherwise indicated in paragraph  (b)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A CMA shall contain the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. Why the match is being proposed and what will be  achieved by conducting the match.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legal authority. What is the Federal or state statutory or  regulatory basis for conducting the match. The Privacy Act does not  constitute independent authority for matching. Other legal authority  shall be identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Justification and expected results. Explain why computer  matching as opposed to some other administrative means is being proposed  and what the expected results will be, including a specific estimate of  any savings (see paragraph (b)(13) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Records description. Identify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The system of records or non-Federal records. For DoD systems of  records, provide the Federal Register citation for the system notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The specific routine use in the system notice if records are to  be disclosed outside the Department of Defense (see Sec. 310.22(c)). If  records are disclosed within the Department of Defense for an internal  match, disclosures are permitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of  Sec. 310.22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The number of records involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The data elements to be included in the match;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The projected start and completion dates of the match. CMAs  remain in effect for 18 months but can be renewed for an additional 12  months provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The match will be conducted without any change, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each party to the match certifies in writing that the program  has been conducted in compliance with the CMA or MOU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> How frequently will the records be matched.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records accuracy assessment. Provide an assessment by the source  and recipient agencies as to the quality of the information that will be  used for the match. The poorer the quality, the more likely that the  program will not be cost-effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notice procedures. Identify what direct and indirect means will  be used to inform individuals that matching will take place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct notice. Indicate whether the individual is advised that  matching may be conducted when he or she applies for a Federal benefit  program. Such an advisory should normally be part of the Privacy Act  Statement that is contained in the application for benefits. Individual  notice sometimes is provided by a separate notice that is furnished the  individual upon receipt of the benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect notice. Indicate whether the individual is advised  that matching may be conducted by constructive notice. Indirect or  constructive notice is achieved by publication of a routine use in the  Federal Register when the matching is between agencies or is achieved by  publication of the match notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Verification procedures. Explain how information produced as a  result of the match will be independently verified to ensure any adverse  information obtained is that of the individual identified in the match.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Due process procedures. Describe what procedures will be used to  notify individuals of any adverse information uncovered as a result of  the match and to give such individuals an opportunity to either explain  the information or how to contest the information. No adverse action  shall be taken against the individual until the due process procedures  have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unless other statutory or regulatory authority provides for a  longer period of time, the individual shall be given 30 calendar days  from the date of the notice to respond to the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an individual contacts the agency within the notice period  and indicates his or her acceptance of the validity of the adverse  information, the agency may take final action. If the period expires  without a response, the agency may take final action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the agency determines that there is a potentially  significant effect on public health or safety, it may take appropriate  action notwithstanding the due process provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Security procedures. Describe the administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards that will be established to preserve and protect the  privacy and confidentiality of the records involved in the match. The  level of security must be commensurate with the level of the sensitivity  of the records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Records usage, duplication, and redisclosure restrictions.  Describe any restrictions imposed by the source agency or by statute or  regulation on the collateral uses of the records. Recipient agencies may  not use the records obtained for matching purposes for any other purpose  absent a specific statutory requirement or where the disclosure is  essential to the conduct of the matching program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Disposition procedures. Clearly state that the records used in  the match will be retained only for the time required for conducting the  match. Once the matching purpose has been achieved, the records will be  destroyed unless the records must be retained as directed by other legal  authority. Unless the source agency requests that the records be  returned, identify the means by which destruction will occur, i.e.,  shredding, burning, electronic erasure, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Comptroller General access. Include a statement that the  Comptroller General may have access to all records of the recipient  agency to monitor or verify compliance with the terms of the CMA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Cost-benefit analysis. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A cost-benefit analysis shall be  conducted for the proposed computer matching program unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Data Integrity Board waives the requirement, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The matching program is required by a specific statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The analysis must demonstrate that the program is likely to be  cost-effective. This analysis is to ensure agencies are following sound  management practices. The analysis provides an opportunity to examine  the programs and to reject those that will only produce marginal  results.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 310--Safeguarding Personally Identifiable</p><p class="depth0">Information (PII)  (See Sec. 310.13 of Subpart B)</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">1. The IT environment subjects personal information to special  hazards as to unauthorized compromise, alteration, dissemination, and  use. Therefore, special considerations must be given to safeguarding  personal information in IT systems consistent with the requirements of  DoD Directive 8500.1 and DoD Instruction 8500.2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Personally identifiable information must also be protected while  it is being processed or accessed in computer environments outside the  data processing installation (such as, remote job entry stations,  terminal stations, minicomputers, microprocessors, and similar  activities).</p><p class="depth0">3. IT facilities authorized to process classified material have  adequate procedures and security for the purposes of this Regulation.  However, all unclassified information subject to this Regulation must be  processed following the procedures used to process and access  information designated ``For Official Use Only.'' (See DoD 5200.1-R.)</p><p class="depth0">B. Risk Management and Safeguarding Standards</p><p class="depth0">1. Establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that  are adequate to protect the information against unauthorized disclosure,  access, or misuse. (See OMB Circular A-130 and DoD Instruction 8500.2.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Tailor safeguards to the type of system, the nature of the  information involved, and the specific threat to be countered.</p><p class="depth0">C. Minimum Administrative Safeguards</p><p class="depth0">The minimum safeguarding standards as set forth in Sec. 310.13(b)  apply to all personal data within any IT system. In addition:</p><p class="depth0">1. Consider the following when establishing IT safeguards:</p><p class="depth0">a. The sensitivity of the data being processed, stored and accessed.</p><p class="depth0">b. The installation environment.</p><p class="depth0">c. The risk of exposure.</p><p class="depth0">d. The cost of the safeguard under consideration.</p><p class="depth0">2. Label or designate media products containing personal information  that do not contain classified material in such a manner as to alert  those using or handling the information of the need for special  protection. Designating products ``For Official Use Only'' in accordance  with the requirements of DoD 5200.1-R satisfies this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mark and protect all computer products containing classified data  in accordance with the requirements of DoD 5200.1-R and DoD Directive  8500.1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mark and protect all computer products containing ``For Official  Use Only'' material in accordance with the requirements of DoD 5200.1-R.</p><p class="depth0">5. Ensure that safeguards for protected information stored at  secondary sites are appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">6. If there is a computer failure, restore all protected information  being processed at the time of the failure using proper recovery  procedures to ensure data integrity.</p><p class="depth0">7. Train personnel involved in processing information subject to  this Regulation in proper safeguarding procedures.</p><p class="depth0">D. Physical Safeguards</p><p class="depth0">1. For all unclassified facilities, areas, and devices that process  information subject to this Regulation, establish physical safeguards  that protect the information against reasonably identifiable threats  that could result in unauthorized access or alteration.</p><p class="depth0">2. Develop access procedures for unclassified computer rooms, tape  libraries, micrographic facilities, decollating shops, product  distribution areas, or other direct support areas that process or  contain personal information subject to this Regulation that control  adequately access to these areas.</p><p class="depth0">3. Safeguard on-line devices directly coupled to IT systems that  contain or process information from systems of records to prevent  unauthorized disclosure, use, or alteration.</p><p class="depth0">4. Dispose of paper records following appropriate record destruction  procedures. (See Sec. 310.13(c) and DoD 5200.1-R.)</p><p class="depth0">E. Technical Safeguards</p><p class="depth0">1. Components are to ensure that all PII not explicitly cleared for  public release is protected according to Confidentially Level Sensitive,  as established in DoD Instruction 8500.2. In addition, all DoD  information and data owners shall conduct risk assessments of  compilations of PII and identify those needing more stringent protection  for remote access or mobile computing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Encrypt unclassified personal information in accordance with  current Information Assurance (IA) policies and procedures, as issued.</p><p class="depth0">3. Remove personal data stored on magnetic storage media by methods  that preclude reconstruction of the data.</p><p class="depth0">4. Ensure that personal information is not inadvertently disclosed  as residue when transferring magnetic media between activities.</p><p class="depth0">5. Only DoD authorized devices shall be used for remote access. Any  remote access, whether for user or privileged functions, must conform to  IA controls specified in DoD Instruction 8500.2.</p><p class="depth0">6. Remote access for processing PII should comply with the latest IA  policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0">7. Minimize access to data fields necessary to accomplish an  employee's task-normally, access shall be granted only to those data  elements (fields) required for the employee to perform his or her job  rather than granting access to the entire database.</p><p class="depth0">8. Do not totally rely on proprietary software products to protect  personnel data during processing or storage.</p><p class="depth0">F. Special Procedures</p><p class="depth0">1. Managers shall:</p><p class="depth0">a. Prepare and submit for publication all system notices and  amendments and alterations thereto. (See Sec. 310.30(f).)</p><p class="depth0">b. Identify required controls and individuals authorized access to  PII and maintain updates to the access authorizations.</p><p class="depth0">c. When required, ensure Privacy Impact Assessments are prepared  consistent with the requirements of the DoD Deputy Chief Information  Officer Memorandum, ``DoD Privacy Impact Assessment Guidance,'' October  28, 2005.</p><p class="depth0">d. Train all personnel whose official duties require access to the  system of records in the proper safeguarding and use of the information  and ensure that they receive Privacy Act training.</p><p class="depth0">G. Record Disposal</p><p class="depth0">1. Dispose of records subject to this Regulation so as to prevent  compromise. (See Sec. 310.13(c).) Magnetic tapes or other magnetic  medium may be cleared by degaussing, overwriting, or erasing. (See DoD  Memorandum, ``Disposition of Unclassified DoD Computer Hard Drives,''  June 4, 2001.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Do not use respliced waste computer products containing personal  data.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 310--Sample Notification Letter  (See Sec. 310.14 of subpart C)  Dear Mr. John Miller:</p><p class="depth0">On January 1, 2006, a Department of Defense (DoD) laptop computer  was stolen from the parked car of a DoD employee in Washington, DC after  normal duty hours while the employee was running a personal errand. The  laptop contained personally identifying information on 100 DoD employees  who were participating in the xxx Program. The compromised information  is the name, social security number, residential address, date of birth,  office and home email address, office and home telephone numbers of the  Program participants.</p><p class="depth0">The theft was immediately reported to local and DoD law enforcement  authorities who are now conducting a joint inquiry into the loss.</p><p class="depth0">We believe that the laptop was the target of the theft as opposed to  any information that the laptop might contain. Because the information  in the laptop was password protected and encrypted, we also believe that  the probability is low that the information will be acquired and used  for an unlawful purpose. However, we cannot say with certainty that this  might not occur. We therefore believe that you should consider taking  such actions as are possible to protect against the potential that  someone might use the information to steal your identity.</p><p class="depth0">You should be guided by the actions recommended by the Federal Trade  Commission at its Web site at http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/ con_steps.htm. The FTC urges that you immediately place an initial fraud  alert on your credit file. The Fraud alert is for a period of 90 days,  during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit  card is issued or an existing card changed. The site also provides other  valuable information that can be taken now or in the future if problems  should develop.</p><p class="depth0">The DoD takes this loss very seriously and is reviewing its current  policies and practices with a view of determining what must be changed  to preclude a similar occurrence in the future. At a minimum, we will be  providing additional training to personnel to ensure that they  understand that personally identifiable information must at all times be  treated in a manner that preserves and protects the confidentiality of  the data.</p><p class="depth0">We deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience and concern  this theft may cause you.</p><p class="depth0">Should you have any questions, please call ------------.  Sincerely,  Signature Block (Directorate level or higher)</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 310--DoD Blanket Routine Uses  (See paragraph (c) of Sec. 310.22 of subpart E)</p><p class="depth0">A. Routine Use--Law Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">If a system of records maintained by a DoD Component to carry out  its functions indicates a violation or potential violation of law,  whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and whether arising by  general statute or by regulation, rule, or order issued pursuant  thereto, the relevant records in the system of records may be referred,  as a routine use, to the agency concerned, whether Federal, State,  local, or foreign, charged with the responsibility of investigating or  prosecuting such violation or charged with enforcing or implementing the  statute, rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant thereto.</p><p class="depth0">B.
