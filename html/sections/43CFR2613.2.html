The Act of February 14, 1920, does not  apply to cases where the applicant's entry has been canceled by the  State or forfeited for failure to perfect the entry according to State  law, unless the failure is the result of conditions which culminated in  the elimination of the lands from the project if the State has allowed a  subsequent entry for the same lands, this shall be conclusive evidence  that the default was the fault of the State entryman whose entry was  forfeited or canceled.</p>
