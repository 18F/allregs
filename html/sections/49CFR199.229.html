                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) shall submit an annual MIS report to PHMSA of its alcohol testing results using the Management Information System (MIS) form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at Sec. 40.25 and appendix H to part 40), not later than March 15 of each year for the previous calendar year (January 1 through December 31). The Administrator may require by written notice that small operators (50 or fewer covered employees) not otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports to prepare and submit such reports to PHMSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each report required under this section shall be submitted to the Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, PHP-60, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as defined in part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and completeness.
