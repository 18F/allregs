A separate license is required for each branch office that is separately incorporated. For purposes of this part, a person is considered to be ``in the United States'' if such person is resident in, or incorporated or established under, the laws of the United States. Only persons licensed under this part may furnish or contract to furnish ocean transportation intermediary services in the United States on behalf of an unlicensed ocean transportation intermediary.</p>
