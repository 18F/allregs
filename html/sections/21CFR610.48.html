The review must include records  dating back indefinitely for computerized electronic records, and to  January 1, 1988, for all other records. Record review, quarantine,  testing, notification, and disposition performed before February 20,  2008 that otherwise satisfy the requirements under Sec. 610.47, are  exempt from this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify donors who tested reactive for evidence of HCV  infection. Donors who tested reactive by a screening test and negative  by an appropriate supplemental (additional, more specific) test under  Sec. 610.40(e) for evidence of HCV infection on the same donation are  not subject to further action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the blood and blood components previously collected  from such donors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Twelve months and less before the donor's most recent  nonreactive screening tests, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Twelve months and less before the donor's reactive direct viral  detection test, e.g., nucleic acid test and nonreactive antibody  screening test, whichever is the lesser period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you did not perform a supplemental (additional, more  specific) test at the time of the reactive donation, you may perform a  supplemental test or a licensed screening test with known greater  sensitivity than the test of record using either a frozen sample from  the same reactive donation or a   fresh sample from the same donor, if obtainable. If neither is  available, proceed with paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must, within 3 calendar days after identifying the blood and  blood components previously collected from donors who tested reactive  for evidence of HCV infection:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Quarantine all previously collected in-date blood and blood  components identified under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section if  intended for use in another person or for further manufacture into  injectable products, except pooled components solely intended for  further manufacturing into products that are manufactured using  validated viral clearance procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify consignees to quarantine all previously collected in- date blood and blood components identified under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)  of this section if intended for use in another person or for further  manufacture into injectable products, except pooled blood components  intended solely for further manufacturing into products that are  manufactured using validated viral clearance procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify consignees of the donor's test results, including the  results of a supplemental (additional, more specific) test or a licensed  screening test with known greater sensitivity than the test of record,  if available at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must notify consignees of the results of the supplemental  (additional, more specific) test or the licensed screening test with  known greater sensitivity than the test of record for HCV, if performed,  within 45 calendar days of completing the further testing.

You must notify the recipient's physician of record or a  legal representative or relative if the recipient is a minor, adjudged  incompetent by a State court, or if the recipient is competent but State  law permits a legal   representative or relative to receive information on behalf of the  recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Actions under this section do not constitute a recall as defined  in Sec. 7.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This section will expire on August 24, 2015.
