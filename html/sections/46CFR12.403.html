Three years of service on deck on vessels operating on oceans or on the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Able seaman--limited. Eighteen months of service on deck on vessels of 100 GRT or more which operate in a service not exclusively confined to the rivers and smaller inland lakes of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Able seaman--special. Twelve months of service on deck on vessels operating on oceans or the navigable waters of the United States, including the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Able seaman--offshore supply vessels. Six months of service on deck on vessels operating on oceans or on the navigable waters of the United States, including the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Able seaman--sail.

For this purpose, ``school ship'' is interpreted to mean an institution that offers a complete approved program of instruction, including a period of at-sea training, in the skills appropriate to the rating of A/B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training programs, other than those classified as a school ship, may be substituted for up to one-third of the required service on deck.
