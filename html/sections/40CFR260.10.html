secondary materials, to prevent releases of hazardous secondary materials to the environment.

For the purpose of this definition, a hazardous secondary material is considered higher-value if it was generated from the use of a commercial-grade material in a manufacturing process and can be remanufactured into a similar commercial-grade material.</p>
