A requester should be prepared to identify himself through production of a driver's license, student or employee identification card, or other identification acceptable to the Executive Director. When the disclosure of records to the wrong individual would result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to the subject individual, the Executive Director may require a notarized statement of identity. The Executive Director shall ensure that such times,

places, and requirements for identification are not excessive and do not restrict individual access unduly.</p>
