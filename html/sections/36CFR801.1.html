                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> These regulations are required by section 110(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 (HCDA) (42 U.S.C. 5320) and apply only to projects proposed to be funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Program authorized by title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301). These regulations establish an expedited process for obtaining the comments of the Council specifically for the UDAG program and, except as specifically provided, substitute for the Council's regulations for the ``Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties'' (36 CFR part 800).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980 requires UDAG applicants to: (1) Identify all properties, if any, which are included in the National Register of Historic Places and which will be affected by the project for which the application is made; (2) identify all other properties, if any, which will be affected by such project and which, as determined by the applicant, may meet the Criteria established by the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the National Register (36 CFR 60.6); and (3) provide a description of the effect, as determined by the applicant, of the project on properties identified pursuant to (1) and (2). If the applicant determines that such properties are affected, the Act requires that the information developed by the applicant must be forwarded to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) for review and to the Secretary of the Interior for a determination as to whether the affected properties are eligible for inclusion in the National Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), requires the head of any Federal agency with jurisdiction over a Federal, federally assisted or federally licensed undertaking that affects a property included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places to take into account the effect of the undertaking on such property and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment. Under the UDAG program, applicants assume the status of a Federal agency for purposes of complying with section 106.</p>
