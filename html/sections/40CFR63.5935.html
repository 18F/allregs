Sec. Appendix A to Subpart WWWW of Part 63--Test Method for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Vapor Suppressant Effectiveness</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. If a facility is using vapor suppressants to reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, the organic HAP emission factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart require that the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor be determined. The vapor suppressant effectiveness factor is then used as one of the inputs into the appropriate organic HAP emission factor equation. The vapor suppressant effectiveness factor test is not intended to quantify overall volatile emissions from a resin, nor to be used as a stand-alone test for emissions determination. This test is designed to evaluate the performance of film forming vapor suppressant resin additives. The results of this test are used only in combination with the organic HAP emissions factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart to generate emission factors.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 The open molding process consists of application of resin and reinforcements to the mold surface, followed by a manual rollout process to consolidate the laminate, and the curing stage where the laminate surface is not disturbed. Emission studies have shown that approximately 50 percent to 55 percent of the emissions occur while the resin is being applied to the mold. Vapor suppressants have little effect during this portion of the lamination process, but can have a significant effect during the curing stage. Therefore, if a suppressant is 100 percent effective, the overall emissions from the process would be reduced by 45 percent to 50 percent, representing the emissions generated during the curing stage. In actual practice, vapor suppressant effectiveness will be less than 100 percent and the test results determine the specific effectiveness in terms of the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor. This factor represents the effectiveness of a specific combination of suppressant additive and resin formulation.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 A resin manufacturer may supply a molder with a vapor-suppressed resin, and employ this test to provide the molder with the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor for that combination of resin and vapor suppressant. The factor qualifies the effectiveness of the vapor suppressant when the resin is tested in the specific formulation supplied to the molder. The addition of fillers or other diluents by the molder may impact the effectiveness of the vapor suppressant. The formulation, including resin/glass ratio and filler content, used in the test should be similar to the formulation to be used in production. The premise of this method is to compare laminate samples made with vapor suppressant additive and made without the additive. The difference in emissions between the two yields the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.3 The method uses a mass balance determination to establish the relative loss of the volatile component from unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resins, with and without vapor suppressant additives. The effectiveness of a specific vapor suppressant and resin mixture is determined by comparing the relative volatile weight losses from vapor suppressed and non-suppressed resins. The volatile species are not separately analyzed. While the species contained in the volatile component are not determined, an extended listing of potential monomer that may be contained in unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resins is provided in Table 1.1. However, most polyester and vinyl ester resin formulations presently used by the composites industry only contain styrene monomer.

Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Differences in specific resin and suppressant additive chemistry affect the performance of a vapor suppressant. The purpose of this method is to quantify the effectiveness of a specific combination of vapor

suppressant and unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resin as they are to be used in production. This comparative test quantifies the loss of volatiles from a fiberglass reinforced laminate during the roll-out and curing emission phases, for resins formulated with and without a suppressant additive. A criterion for this method is the testing of a non-vapor suppressed resin system and testing the same resin with a vapor suppressant. The two resins are as identical as possible with the exception of the addition of the suppressant to one. The exact formulation used for the test will be determined by the in-use production requirements.

Test Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Test Set-up.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 The laboratory balance is located in an enclosure to prevent fluctuations in balance readings due to localized air movement. The front of enclosure is open to permit work activity, but positioned so that local airflow will not effect balance readings. The ambient temperature is determined by suspending the thermometer at a point inside the enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 The bottom of the aluminum pan is covered with the Mylar film. The film is held in position with tape or by friction between the pan and the film.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.3 The resin and pan are brought to room temperature. This test temperature must be between 70 [deg]F and 80 [deg]F. The testing temperature cannot vary more than 2 [deg]F during the measurement of test runs. Temperature shall be recorded at the same time weight is recorded on suppressed and non-suppressed test data sheets, shown in Table 17.1.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.4 The relative humidity may not change more than 15 percent during the test runs. This is determined by recording the relative humidity in the vicinity of the test chamber at the beginning and end of an individual test run. This data is recorded on the test data sheets shown in Table 17.1.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.5 Two plies of nominal 1.5 oz/ft\2\ chopped strand mat (CSM) are cut into a square or rectangle with the minimum surface area of 60 square inches (i.e. a square with a side dimension of 7.75 inches).</p><p class="depth0">11.1.6 The appropriate resin application roller is readily available.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Resin Gel Time/Initiator Percentage</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Previous testing has indicated that resin gel time influences the emissions from composite production. The testing indicated that longer the gel times led to higher emissions. There are a number of factors that influence gel time including initiator type, initiator brand, initiator level, temperature and resin additives. Under actual usage conditions a molder will adjust the initiator to meet a gel time requirement. In this test procedure, the vapor suppressed and non-vapor suppressed resin systems will be adjusted to the same gel time by selecting the appropriate initiator level for each.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 All test runs within a test will be processed in a manner that produces the same resin gel time 2 minutes. To facilitate the resin mixing procedure, master batches of resin and resin plus vapor suppressant of resin are prepared. These resin master batches will have all of the required ingredients except initiator; this includes filler for filled systems. The gel times for the tests are conducted using the master batch and adjustments to meet gel time requirements shall be made to the master batch before emission testing is conducted. Test temperatures must be maintained within the required range, during gel time testing. Further gel time testing is not required after the non-vapor suppressed and vapor suppressed master batches are established with gel times within 2 minutes. A sufficient quantity of each resin should be prepared to allow for additional test specimens in the event one or more test fails to meet the data acceptance criteria discussed in Section 11.5 and shown in Table 17.2.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 The specific brand of initiator and the nominal percentage level recommended by the resin manufacturer will be indicated on the resin certificate of analysis \15\; or, if a unique gel time is required in a production laminate, initiator brand and percentage will be determined by that specific requirement.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Examples:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4.1 The resin for a test run is specified as having a 15-minute cup gel time at 77 [deg]F using Brand X initiator at 1.5 percent by weight. The non-suppressed control resin has a 15-minute gel time. The suppressed resin has a gel time of 17-minutes. An initiator level of 1.5 percent would be selected for the both the non-suppressed and the suppressed test samples.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4.2 Based on a specific production requirement, a resin is processed in production using 2.25 percent of Brand Y initiator, which produces a 20-minute gel time. This initiator at level of 2.25 percent produces a 20 minute gel time for the non-suppressed control resin, but yields a 25-minute gel time for the suppressed resin sample. The suppressed resin is retested at 2.50 percent initiator and produces a 21-minute gel time. The initiator levels of 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent respectively would yield gel times within 2 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Test Run Procedure for Unfilled Resin (see the data sheet shown in Table 17.1).</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 The insulating board is placed on the balance.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 The aluminum pan with attached Mylar film is placed on the balance, and the balance is tared (weight reading set to zero with the plate on the balance.)</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 Place two plies of 1.5 oz.

For the remaining five tests in the series, after the initial weights are taken, the next weight is recorded 30 minutes before the end of the test, as suggested by the results from the first test.

Pushing excess resin off the reinforcement and onto the Mylar sheet should be avoided. No resin is to be pushed more than \1/2\ inch beyond the edge of the glass mat. If excess resin is pushed further from the glass mat, it will void the test run. As part of this process, typical visible air voids are to be eliminated by the rollout process.

This procedure typically uses a 100 gram cup sample at 77 [deg]F (25 [deg]C), a specific type of initiator and a specified percentage.</p><p class="depth0">\16\ Roll-out times may vary with resin viscosity or resin additive. The important aspect of this step is to produce the same roll-out time for both the suppressed and non-suppressed samples.</p><p class="depth0">\17\ While this test can be used with filled resin systems, the test is not designed to determine the effect of the filler on emissions, but rather to measure the effect of the suppressant additive in the resin system. When evaluating a filled system both the non-vapor suppressed and vapor suppressed samples should be formulated with the same type and level of filler.</p><p class="depth0">16.2 References</p><p class="depth0">1.
