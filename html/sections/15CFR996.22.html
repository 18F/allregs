                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A hydrographic product that has passed the compliance tests  shall automatically be considered for certification by NOAA. NOAA shall  make its certification determination, if its other obligations permit,  within 60 calendar days following receipt of the compliance test  results. NOAA shall make a certification determination based upon the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The results of the compliance tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The potential for the hydrographic product to impair public  safety;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Successful completion of any administrative requirements,  including the payment of required fees, as may be specified by NOAA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The potential for certification to cause embarrassment to the  Agency or the Department;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other relevant criteria as they become apparent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hydrographic products receiving a certification determination in  the affirmative shall be designated as ``certified'' by NOAA. NOAA shall  provide a written document to the sponsor indicating such, and shall  announce its determination in the Federal Register or by other  appropriate means. Certification shall mean that the hydrographic  product has been found to be in compliance with the NOAA-adopted  standard for that hydrographic product or class. Certification conveys  no express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for  a particular purpose; conveys no express or implied liability on the  part of the Government of the United States for the hydrographic  products; and conveys no automatic, direct or indirect NOAA endorsement  of any product or service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification shall be for a term of 3 years unless otherwise  specified by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certification may be renewed, at the request of sponsor and  the option of NOAA, for a period of 2 years. Sponsors may request the  renewal of a certification by writing to the Quality Assurance Program  address at least 120 calendar days before the expiration of an existing  certification. The request shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifying and contact information for the sponsor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identifying information for the relevant hydrographic product(s)  and the standard(s) under which they were certified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence sufficient to assure NOAA that the hydrographic product  still meets the standard under which it was certified; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other information as may be requested by NOAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NOAA shall decide within 60 calendar days, if its other  obligations permit, whether to renew a certification. NOAA's decision  shall be based on whether the hydrographic product continues to meet the  applicable standard, and other relevant criteria as they become  apparent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The sponsor shall have an opportunity to request reconsideration  of NOAA's decision. Said request shall be submitted in writing, to the  Quality Assurance Program address, postmarked within 30 days of NOAA's  announcement of its decision, and shall contain written material  supporting the requestor's position. NOAA shall have, if its other  obligations permit, 30 calendar days from the receipt of a request for  reconsideration to either deny the request, or to reconsider and  announce its decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NOAA's decision, either the original decision if unappealed  within 30 days, or the decision after the request for reconsideration,  shall be considered final.</p>
