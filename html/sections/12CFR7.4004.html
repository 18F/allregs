                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A national bank or its operating subsidiary may engage in deposit production activities at a site other than the main office or a branch of the bank. A deposit production office (DPO) may solicit deposits, provide information about deposit products, and assist persons in completing application forms and related documents to open a deposit account. A DPO is not a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30(d)(1) so long as it does not receive deposits, pay withdrawals, or make loans. All deposit and withdrawal transactions of a bank customer using a DPO must be performed by the customer, either in person at the main office or a branch office of the bank, or by mail, electronic transfer, or a similar method of transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services of other persons. A national bank may use the services of, and compensate, persons not employed by the bank in its deposit production activities.
