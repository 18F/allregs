                            <p class="depth0">For normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the strength, detail design, and fabrication of the metallic structure of the pressure cabin must be evaluated under one of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown by tests, or by analysis supported by test evidence, to be able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in service; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A fail safe strength investigation, in which it is shown by analysis, tests, or both that catastrophic failure of the structure is not probable after fatigue

failure, or obvious partial failure, of a principal structural element, and that the remaining structures are able to withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the limit load factor at VC, considering the combined effects of normal operating pressures, expected external aerodynamic pressures, and flight loads. These loads must be multiplied by a factor of 1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load are otherwise considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The damage tolerance evaluation of Sec. 23.573(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If certification for operation above 41,000 feet is requested, a damage tolerance evaluation of the fuselage pressure boundary per Sec. 23.573(b) must be conducted.
