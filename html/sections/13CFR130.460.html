The budget shall be reviewed annually upon submission of a renewal application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direct costs. Unless otherwise provided in applicable OMB circulars, at least eighty percent (80%) of SBA funding must be allocated to direct costs of Program delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indirect costs. If the applicant organization waives all indirect costs to meet the Matching Funds requirement, one hundred percent (100%) of SBA funding must be allocated to program delivery. If some, but not all, indirect costs are waived to meet the Matching Funds requirement, the lesser of the following may be allocated as indirect costs of the Program and charged against the Federal contribution:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Twenty percent (20%) of Federal contribution, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount remaining after the waived portion of indirect costs is subtracted from the total indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separate SBDC service provider budgets. (1) The applicant organization shall include separate budgets for all subcontracted SBDC service providers in conformity with OMB requirements. Applicable direct cost categories and indirect cost base/rate agreements shall be included for the Lead Center and all SBDC service providers, using a rate equal to or less than the negotiated predetermined rate. If no such

rate exists, the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider shall negotiate a rate with its Cognizant Agency. In the event the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider does not have a Cognizant Agency, the rate shall be negotiated with the SBA Project Officer in accordance with OMB guidelines (see OMB Circular A-21).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant organization shall include separate budgets for all subcontracted SBDC service providers in conformity with OMB requirements. Applicable direct cost categories and indirect cost base/rate agreements shall be included for the Lead Center and all SBDC service providers, using a rate equal to or less than the negotiated predetermined rate. If no such

In the event the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider does not have a Cognizant Agency, the rate shall be negotiated with the SBA Project Officer in accordance with OMB guidelines (see OMB Circular A-21).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of cash, in-kind contributions and indirect costs for the Lead Center and all sub-contracted SBDC service providers shall be indicated in accordance with OMB requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost principles. Principles for determining allowable costs are contained in OMB Circulars A-21 (cost principles for grants, contracts, and other agreements with educational institutions), A-87 (cost principles for programs administered by State and local governments), and A-122 (cost principles for nonprofit organizations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Costs associated with lobbying. No portion of the Federal contribution received by an SBDC may be used for lobbying activities, either directly by the SBDC or indirectly through outside organizations, except those activities permitted by OMB. Restrictions on and reports of lobbying activities by the SBDC shall be in accordance with OMB requirements, Section 319 of Public Law No. 101-121, and the annual Program Announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Salaries. (1) If a recipient organization is an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average annualized salary of a full professor and an assistant professor, respectively, in the school or department in which the SBDC is located. If a recipient organization is not an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average salaries of parallel positions within the recipient organization. In both cases, the recipient organization should consider the Director's longevity in the Program, the number of subcenters and the individual's experience and background.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a recipient organization is an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average annualized salary of a full professor and an assistant professor, respectively, in the school or department in which the SBDC is located. If a recipient organization is not an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average salaries of parallel positions within the recipient organization. In both cases, the recipient organization should consider the Director's longevity in the Program, the number of subcenters and the individual's experience and background.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Salaries for all other positions within the SBDC should be based upon level of responsibility, and be comparable to salaries for similar positions in the area served by the SBDC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recruitment and salary increases for SBDC Directors, subcenter Directors and staff members should conform to the administrative policy of the recipient organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Travel. All travel must be separately identified in the proposed budget as planned in-State, planned out-of-State, unplanned in-State or unplanned out-of-State. All proposed travel must use coach class, apply directly to specific work of the SBDC or be incurred in the normal course of Program administration, and conform to the written travel policies of the recipient organization or the sponsoring SBDC organization. (Per diem rates, including lodging, shall not exceed those authorized by the recipient organization.) Transportation costs must be justified in writing, including the estimated cost, number of persons traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community from the proposed travel. A specific projected amount, based on the SBDC's past experience, where appropriate, must also be included in the budget for unplanned travel. A more detailed justification must be given for unplanned out-of-State travel. Any proposed unplanned out-of-State travel exceeding the approved budgeted amount for travel must be submitted to the Project Officer for approval on a case-by-case basis. Travel outside the United States must have prior approval by the AA/SBDCs on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dues. Costs of memberships in business, technical, and professional organizations shall be allowable expenses.
