                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible lenders. Eligible lenders (as defined in this section) may participate in the loan guarantee program. These lenders must be subject to credit examination and supervision by an appropriate agency of the United States or a State that supervises and regulates credit institutions. A lender must have the capability to adequately service loans for which a guarantee is requested. Eligible lenders are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Federal or State chartered bank or savings and loan association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any mortgage company that is a part of a bank holding company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bank for Cooperatives, National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, Farm Credit Bank of the Federal Land Bank, or other Farm Credit System institution with direct lending authority authorized to make loans of the type guaranteed by this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An insurance company regulated by a State or National insurance regulatory agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State Bond Banks or State Bond Pools; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other lenders that possess the legal powers necessary and incidental to making and servicing guaranteed loans involving community development-type projects. These lenders must also be subject to credit examination and supervision by either an appropriate agency of the United States or a State that supervises and regulates credit institutions and provide documentation acceptable to the Agency that they have the ability to service the loan. Lenders under this category must be approved by the National Office prior to the issuance of the loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conflict of interest. The lender and borrower must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of its employees in the selection, award and administration of Federal awards. No employee, officer or agent may participate in the selection, award or administration of a Federal award if they have a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a non-Federal entity considered for a Federal award. The lender may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards. If the lender has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the lender or borrower, written standards of conduct covering organizational conflict of interest must also be maintained. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of the relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the lender or borrower is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a Federal award action involving a related organization. The lender or borrower must disclose such business or ownership relationships in writing. The Agency will determine if such relationships are likely to result in a conflict of interest. This does not preclude lender officials from being on the borrower's board of directors.
