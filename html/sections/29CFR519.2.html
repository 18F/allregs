A bona fide educational  institution is ordinarily an accredited institution. However, a school  which is not accredited may be considered a bona fide educational  institution in exceptional circumstances, such as when the school is too  recently established to have received accreditation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retail or service establishment. Retail or service establishment  means a retail or service establishment as defined in section 13(a)(2)  of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The statutory definition is interpreted  in part 779 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agriculture. Agriculture means agriculture as defined in section  3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The statutory definition is  interpreted in part 780 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Student hours of employment. Student hours of employment means  hours during which students are employed under full-time student  certificates issued under this part and is distinguished from hours of  employment of students.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Employer. Section 519.4 permits an agricultural or retail or  service establishment employer to employ not more than six full-time  students at subminimum wages on forwarding an application but before  certification. For this purpose, the term employer looks to the highest  structure of ownership or control, and hence may be more than a single  retail or service establishment or farm, e.g., the controlling  conglomerate or enterprise would be the employer. With respect to public  employers who operate retail or service establishments (see 29 CFR part  779), the employer means the highest structure of control such as the  State, municipality, county or other political subdivision.
