                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As explained in preceding sections of this part, section  13(b)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act does not exempt an employee of  a carrier from the act's overtime provisions unless it appears, among  other things, that his activities as a driver, driver's helper, loader,  or mechanic directly affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles in  transportation in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of  the Motor Carrier Act. What constitutes such transportation in  interstate or foreign commerce, sufficient to bring such an employee  within the regulatory power of the Secretary of Transportation under  section 204 of that act, is determined by definitions contained in the  Motor Carrier Act itself. These definitions are, however, not identical  with the definitions in the Fair Labor Standards Act which determine  whether an employee is within the general coverage of the wage and hours  provisions as an employee ``engaged in (interstate or foreign)  commerce.'' For this reason, the interstate commerce requirements of the  section 13(b)(1) exemption are not necessarily met by establishing that  an employee is ``engaged in commerce'' within the meaning of the Fair  Labor Standards Act when performing activities as a driver, driver's  helper, loader, or mechanic, where these activities are sufficient in  other respects to bring him within the exemption. (Hager v. Brinks, Inc.  (N.D. Ill.), 11 Labor Cases, par. 63,296, 6 W.H. Cases 262; Earle v.  Brinks, Inc., 54 F. Supp. 676 (S.D. N.Y.); Thompson v. Daugherty, 40 F.  Supp. 279 (D. Md.). See also, Walling v. Villaume Box & Lbr. Co., 58 F.  Supp. 150 (D. Minn.). And see in this connection paragraph (b) of this  section and Sec. 782.8.) To illustrate, employees of construction  contractors are, within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  engaged in commerce where they operate or repair motor vehicles used in  the maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of instrumentalities of  interstate commerce (for example, highways over which goods and persons  regularly move in interstate commerce). (Walling v. Craig, 53 F. Supp.  479 (D. Minn). See also Engbretson v. E. J. Albrecht Co., 150 F. (2d)  602 (C.A. 7); Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318 U.S. 125; Pedersen v.  J. F. Fitzgerald Constr. Co., 318 U.S. 740, 742.) Employees so engaged  are not, however, brought within the exemption merely by reason of that  fact. In order for the exemption to apply, their activities, so far as  interstate commerce is concerned, must relate directly to the  transportation of materials moving in interstate or foreign commerce  within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. Asphalt distributor- operators, although not exempt by reason of their work in applying the  asphalt to the highways, are within the exemption where they transport  to the road site asphalt moving in interstate commerce. See Richardson  v. James Gibbons Co., 132 F. (2d) 627 (C.A. 4), affirmed 319 U.S. 44  (and see reference to this case in footnote 18 of Levinson v. Spector  Motor Service, 330 U.S. 649); Walling v. Craig, 53 F. Supp. 479 (D.  Minn.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  even though the facts may establish a ``practical continuity of  movement'' from out-of-State sources through such in-State trip so as to  make the trip one in interstate commerce under the Fair Labor Standards  Act. Of course, engagement in local transportation which is entirely in  intrastate commerce provides no basis for exempting a motor carrier  employee. (Kline v. Wirtz, 373 F. 2d 281 (C.A. 5). See also paragraph  (b) of this section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Interstate Commerce Commission held that transportation  confined to points in a single State from a storage terminal of  commodities which have had a prior movement by rail, pipeline, motor, or  water from an origin in a different State is not in interstate or  foreign commerce within the meaning of part II of the Interstate  Commerce Act if the shipper has no fixed and persisting transportation  intent beyond the terminal storage point at the time of shipment. See Ex  parte No. MC-48 (71 M.C.C. 17, 29). The Commission specifically ruled  that there is not fixed and persisting intent where: (i) At the time of  shipment there is no specific order being filled for a specific   quantity of a given product to be moved through to a specific  destination beyond the terminal storage, and (ii) the terminal storage  is a distribution point or local marketing facility from which specific  amounts of the product are sold or allocated, and (iii) transportation  in the furtherance of this distribution within the single State is  specifically arranged only after sale or allocation from storage. In  Baird v. Wagoner Transportation Co., 425 F. (2d) 407 (C.A. 6), the court  found each of these factors to be present and held the intrastate  transportation activities were not ``in interstate commerce'' within the  meaning of the Motor Carrier Act and denied the section 13(b)(1)  exemption. While ex parte No. MC-48 deals with petroleum and petroleum  products, the decision indicates that the same reasoning applies to  general commodities moving interstate into a warehouse for distribution  (71 M.C.C. at 27). Accordingly, employees engaged in such transportation  are not subject to the Motor Carrier Act and therefore not within the  section 13(b)(1) exemption. They may, however, be engaged in commerce  within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act. (See in this  connection, Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp. v. Keen, 157 F. 2d 310 (C.A.  8); DeLoach v. Crowley's Inc., 128 F. 2d 378 (C.A. 5); Walling v.  Jacksonville Paper Co., 69 F. Supp. 599, affirmed 167 F. 2d 448,  reversed on another point in 336 U.S. 187; and Standard Oil Co. v. Trade  Commission, 340 U.S. 231, 238).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The wage and hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act  are applicable not only to employees engaged in commerce, as defined in  the act, but also to employees engaged in the production of goods for  commerce. Employees engaged in the ``production'' of goods are defined  by the act as including those engaged in ``handling, transporting, or in  any other manner working on such goods, or in closely related process or  occupation directly essential to the production thereof, in any State.''  (Fair Labor Standards Act, sec. 3(j), 29 U.S.C., sec. 203(j), as amended  by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, 63 Stat. 910. See also  the Division's Interpretative Bulletin, part 776 of this chapter on  general coverage of the wage and hours provisions of the act.) Where  transportation of persons or property by motor vehicle between places  within a State falls within this definition, and is not transportation  in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the Motor  Carrier Act because movement from points out of the State has ended or  because movement to points out of the State has not yet begun, the  employees engaged in connection with such transportation (this applies  to employees of common, contract, and private carriers) are covered by  the wage and hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and are  not subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation.  Examples are: (1) Drivers transporting goods in and about a plant  producing goods for commerce; (2) chauffeurs or drivers of company cars  or buses transporting officers or employees from place to place in the  course of their employment in an establishment which produces goods for  commerces; (3) drivers who transport goods from a producer's plant to  the plant of a processor, who, in turn, sells goods in interstate  commerce, the first producer's goods being a part or ingredient of the  second producer's goods; (4) drivers transporting goods between a  factory and the plant of an independent contractor who performs  operations on the goods, after which they are returned to the factory  which further processes the goods for commerce; and (5) drivers  transporting goods such as machinery or tools and dies, for example, to  be used or consumed in the production of other goods for commerce. These  and other employees engaged in connection with the transportation within  a State of persons or property by motor vehicle who are subject to the  Fair Labor Standards Act because engaged in the production of goods for  commerce and who are not subject to the Motor Carrier Act because not  engaged in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of that  act, are not within the exemption provided by section 13(b)(1). (Walling  v. Comet Carriers, 151 F. (2d) 107 (C.A. 2); Griffin Cartage Co. v.  Walling, 153 F. (2d) 587 (C.A. 6); Walling v. Morris, 155 F. (2d) 832  (C.A. 6), reversed on other grounds in Morris v. McComb, 332 U.S. 422;  West Kentucky Coal Co. v. Walling, 153 F. (2d) 582 (C.A. 6); Hamlet   Ice Co. v. Fleming, 127 F. (2d) 165 (C.A. 4); Atlantic Co. v. Walling,  131 F.
