The Administrator may consult with the Judicial  Officer or delegate all or part of the Administrator's authority to act  in a given case under this section to a Judicial Officer, provided that  this delegation does not preclude the Judicial Officer from referring  any motion or case to the Administrator when the Judicial Officer  determines such referral to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section, one or more Judicial Officers  may be designated. As work requires, a Judicial Officer may be  designated to act for the purposes of a particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Summary decision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a hearing requested under  Sec. 89.511(j), when it clearly appears from the data and other  information contained in the request for a hearing that no genuine and  substantial question of fact or law exists with respect to the issues  specified in Sec. 89.512(c)(2), the Administrator may enter an order  denying the request for a hearing and reaffirming the original decision  to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 89.512 to  challenge a suspension of a certificate of conformity for the reasons  specified in Sec. 89.511(d), when it clearly appears from the data and  other information contained in the request for the hearing that no  genuine and substantial question of fact or law exists with respect to  the issue of whether the refusal to comply with the provisions of a test  order or any other requirement of Sec. 89.503 was caused by conditions  and circumstances outside the control of the manufacturer, the  Administrator may enter an order denying the request for a hearing and  suspending the certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any order issued under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this  section has the   force and effect of a final decision of the Administrator, as issued  pursuant to Sec. 89.515.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator determines that a genuine and substantial  question of fact or law does exist with respect to any of the issues  referred to in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, the  Administrator will grant the request for a hearing and publish a notice  of public hearing in the Federal Register or by such other means as the  Administrator finds appropriate to provide notice to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Filing and service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An original and two copies of all  documents or papers required or permitted to be filed pursuant to this  section and Sec. 89.512(c) must be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the  Agency. Filing is considered timely if mailed, as determined by the  postmark, to the Hearing Clerk within the time allowed by this section  and Sec. 89.512(b).

The Administrator or the Presiding Officer in his  discretion may consolidate two or more proceedings to be held under this  section for the purpose of resolving one or more issues whenever it  appears that consolidation will expedite or simplify consideration of  these issues.
