During each idle mode the engine speed shall be held within [75 rpm or [5 percent of the manufacturers specified idle speed, whichever is greater. For direct drive products (no neutral gear), it is acceptable to have an accessory load on the engine during the idle mode provided that the engine speed is within [5 percent of the manufacturers specified idle speed and the accessory load is representative of in use operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section for modes 2, 3, 4, and 5 cannot be maintained, the Administrator may authorize deviations from the specified load conditions. Such deviations shall not exceed 10 percent of the maximum torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above and below the specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be determined by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior to the test run.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Do not include power generated during the idle mode (mode 5) in the calculation of emissions results.</p>
