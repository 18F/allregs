                            <p class="depth0">The owner or operator shall demonstrate and maintain financial responsibility for post-closure by using a

trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, financial test, insurance or corporate guarantee that meets the specifications for the mechanisms and instruments revised as appropriate to cover closure and post-closure care in 40 CFR part 144, subpart F. The amount of the funds available shall be no less than the amount identified in Sec.  146.72(a)(4)(vi). The obligation to maintain financial responsibility for post-closure care survives the termination of a permit or the cessation of injection. The requirement to maintain financial responsibility is enforceable regardless of whether the requirement is a condition of the permit.</p>
