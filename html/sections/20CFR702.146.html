                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All amounts collected as fines and penalties under the several  provisions of the Act shall be paid into the special fund (33 U.S.C.  44(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever an employee dies under circumstances creating a  liability on an employer to pay death benefits to the employee's  beneficiaries, and whenever there are no such beneficiaries entitled to  such payments, the employer shall pay $5,000 into the special fund (Act,  section 44(c)(1)). In such cases, the compensation order entered in the  case shall specifically find that there is such liability and that there  are no beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, and shall order payment  by the employer into the fund. Compensation orders shall be made and  filed in accordance with the regulations in subpart C of this part 702,  except that for this purpose the district director settling the case  under Sec. 702.315 shall formalize the memorandum of conference in a  compensation order, and shall file such order as provided for in Sec.  702.349.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1) and (2) of this section will be divided by two,  and the resulting percentage multiplied by the probable expenses of the  fund. The Director may, in his or her discretion, condition continuance  or renewal of authorization under part 703 upon prompt payment of the  assessment. However, no action suspending or revoking such authorization  shall be taken without affording such carrier or self-insurer a hearing  before the Director or his/her designee.
