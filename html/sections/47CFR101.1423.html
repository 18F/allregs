                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to Sec. 2.301 of this chapter, MVDDS systems in the United  States within 56 km (35 miles) of the Canadian and Mexican border will  be granted conditional licenses, until final international agreements  are approved. These systems may not cause harmful interference to  stations in Canada or Mexico. MVDDS stations must comply with the  procedures outlined under Sec. Sec. 101.147(p) and 1.928(f)(1) and  (f)(2) of this chapter until final international agreements concerning  MVDDS are signed. Section 1.928(f) of this chapter states that  transmitting antennas can be located as close as five miles (eight  kilometers) of the border if they point within a sector of 160 degrees  away from the border, and as close as thirty-five miles (fifty-six km)  of the border if they point within a sector of 200 degrees toward the  border without coordination with Canada. MVDDS licensees shall apply  this method near the Canadian and Mexican borders. No stations are  allowed within 5 miles of the borders.</p>
