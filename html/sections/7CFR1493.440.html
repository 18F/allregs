the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose of securing business; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of Sec. 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter.
