                            <p class="depth0">Section 108 of the Act requires the Secretary of Energy to select  and perform remedial actions with the concurrence of the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission and the full participation of any State that pays  part of the cost, and in consultation, as appropriate, with affected  Indian Tribes and the Secretary of the Interior. These parties, in their  respective roles under section 108, are referred to hereafter as ``the  implementing agencies.'' The implementing agencies shall establish  methods and procedures to provide ``reasonable assurance'' that the  provisions of Subparts A and B are satisfied. This should be done as  appropriate through use of analytic models and site-specific analyses,  in the case of Subpart A, and for Subpart B through measurements  performed within the accuracy of currently available types of field and  laboratory instruments in conjunction with reasonable survey and  sampling procedures. These methods and procedures may be varied to suit  conditions at specific sites. In particular:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of Subpart A is to provide for long-term  stabilization and isolation in order to inhibit misuse and spreading of  residual radioactive materials, control releases of radon to air, and  protect water. Subpart A may be implemented through analysis of the  physical properties of the site and the control system and projection of  the effects of natural processes over time. Events and processes that  could significantly affect the average radon release rate from the  entire disposal site should be considered. Phenomena that are localized  or temporary, such as local cracking or burrowing of rodents, need to be  taken into account only if their cumulative effect would be significant  in determining compliance with the standard. Computational models,  theories, and prevalent expert judgment may be used to decide that a  control system design will satisfy the standard. The numerical range  provided in the standard for the longevity of the effectiveness of the  control of residual radioactive materials allows for consideration of  the various factors affecting the longevity of control and stabilization  methods and their costs. These factors have different levels of  predictability and may vary for the different sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protection of water should be considered on a case-specific  basis, drawing on hydrological and geochemical surveys and all other  relevant data. The hydrologic and geologic assessment to be conducted at  each site should include a monitoring program sufficient to establish  background groundwater quality through one or more upgradient or other  appropriately located wells. The groundwater monitoring list in Appendix  IX of part 264 of this chapter (plus the additional constituents in  Table A of this paragraph) may be used for screening purposes in place  of Appendix I of part 192 in the monitoring program. New depository  sites for tailings that contain water at greater than the level of  ``specific retention'' should use aliner or equivalent. In considering  design objectives for groundwater protection, the implementing agencies  should give priority to concentration levels in the order listed under  Sec. 192.02(c)(3)(i). When considering the potential for health risks  caused by human exposure to known or suspected carcinogens, alternate  concentration limits pursuant to paragraph 192.02(c)(3)(ii) should be  established at concentration levels which represent an excess lifetime  risk, at a point of exposure, to an average individual no greater than  between 10-4 and 10-6.</p><p class="depth3">Table A to Sec. 192.20(a)(2)--Additional Listed Constituents Nitrate (as N) Molybdenum Combined radium-226 and radium-228 Combined uranium-234 and uranium-238 Gross alpha-particle activity (excluding radon and uranium)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan for remedial action, concurred in by the Commission,  will specify how applicable requirements of subpart A are to be  satisfied. The plan   should include the schedule and steps necessary to complete disposal  operations at the site. It should include an estimate of the inventory  of wastes to be disposed of in the pile and their listed constituents  and address any need to eliminate free liquids; stabilization of the  wastes to a bearing capacity sufficient to support the final cover; and  the design and engineering specifications for a cover to manage the  migration of liquids through the stabilized pile, function without  maintenance, promote drainage and minimize erosion or abrasion of the  cover, and accommodate settling and subsidence so that cover integrity  is maintained. Evaluation of proposed designs to conform to subpart A  should be based on realistic technical judgments and include use of  available empirical information. The consideration of possible failure  modes and related corrective actions should be limited to reasonable  failure assumptions, with a demonstration that the disposal design is  generally amenable to a range of corrective actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The groundwater monitoring list in Appendix IX of part 264 of  this chapter (plus the additional constituents in Table A in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section) may be used for screening purposes in place of  Appendix I of part 192 in monitoring programs. The monitoring plan  required under Sec. 192.03 should be designed to include verification  of site-specific assumptions used to project the performance of the  disposal system. Prevention of contamination of groundwater may be  assessed by indirect methods, such as measuring the migration of  moisture in the various components of the cover, the tailings, and the  area between the tailings and the nearest aquifer, as well as by direct  monitoring of groundwater. In the case of vicinity properties (Sec.  192.01(l)(2)), such assessments may not be necessary, as determined by  the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, considering such  factors as local geology and the amount of contamination present.  Temporary excursions from applicable limits of groundwater  concentrations that are attributable to a disposal operation itself  shall not constitute a basis for considering corrective action under  Sec. 192.04 during the disposal period, unless the disposal operation  is suspended prior to completion for other than seasonal reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with Sec. 192.12(a) and (b) of subpart B, to the  extent practical, should be demonstrated through radiation surveys. Such  surveys may, if appropriate, be restricted to locations likely to  contain residual radioactive materials. These surveys should be designed  to provide for compliance averaged over limited areas rather than point- by-point compliance with the standards. In most cases, measurement of  gamma radiation exposure rates above and below the land surface can be  used to show compliance with Sec. 192.12(a). Protocols for making such  measurements should be based on realistic radium distributions near the  surface rather than extremes rarely encountered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In Sec. 192.12(a), ``background level'' refers to the native  radium concentration in soil. Since this may not be determinable in the  presence of contamination by residual radioactive materials, a surrogate  ``background level'' may be established by simple direct or indirect  (e.g., gamma radiation) measurements performed nearby but outside of the  contaminated location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with Sec. 192.12(b) may be demonstrated by methods  that the Department of Energy has approved for use under Pub. L. 92-314  (10 CFR part 712), or by other methods that the implementing agencies  determine are adequate. Residual radioactive materials should be removed  from buildings exceeding 0.03 WL so that future replacement buildings  will not pose a hazard [unless removal is not practical--see Sec.  192.21(c)]. However, seal ants, filtration, and ventilation devices may  provide reasonable as sur ance of reductions from 0.03 WL to below 0.02  WL. In unusual cases, indoor radiation may exceed the levels specified  in Sec. 192.12(b) due to sources other than residual radioactive  materials. Re medial actions are not required in order to comply with  the standard when there is reasonable assurance that residual  radioactive materials are not the cause of such an excess.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The plan(s) for remedial action will specify how applicable  requirements of subpart B would be satisfied. The plan should include  the schedule and steps necessary to complete the cleanup of groundwater  at the site. It should document the extent of contamination due to  releases prior to final disposal, including the identification and  location of listed constituents and the rate and direction of movement  of contaminated groundwater, based upon the monitoring carried out under  Sec. 192.12(c)(1). In addition, the assessment should consider future  plume movement, including an evaluation of such processes as attenuation  and dilution and future contamination from beneath a disposal site.  Monitoring for assessment and compliance purposes should be sufficient  to establish the extent and magnitude of contamination, with reasonable  assurance, through use of a carefully chosen minimal number of sampling  locations. The location and number of monitoring wells, the frequency  and duration of monitoring, and the selection of indicator analytes for  long-term groundwater monitoring, and, more generally, the design and  operation of the monitoring system, will depend on the potential for  risk to receptors and upon other factors, including characteristics of  the subsurface environment, such as velocity of groundwater flow,  contaminant retardation, time of groundwater or contaminant transit to  receptors, results of statistical evaluations of data trends, and  modeling of the dynamics of the groundwater system. All of these factors  should be incorporated into the design of a site-specific monitoring  program that will achieve the purpose of the regulations in this subpart  in the most cost-effective manner. In the case of vicinity properties  (Sec. 192.01(l)(2)), such assessments will usually not be necessary.  The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, may consider such  factors as local geology and amount of contamination present in  determining criteria to decide when such assessments are needed. In  cases where Sec. 192.12(c)(2) is invoked, the plan should include a  monitoring program sufficient to verify projections of plume movement  and attenuation periodically during the extended cleanup period.  Finally, the plan should specify details of the method to be used for  cleanup of groundwater.  [48 FR 602, Jan. 5, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 2867, Jan. 11, 1995]</p>
