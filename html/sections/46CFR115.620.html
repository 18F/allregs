                                Sec.  115.620  Description of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program provides you with an  alternative to a drydock examination by allowing your vessel's hull to  be examined while it remains afloat. If completed using only divers,  this program has four steps: the application process, the preliminary  examination, the pre-survey meeting, and the hull examination. If the  vessel is already participating in the program or if a remotely operated  vehicle (ROV) is used during the program, the preliminary exam step may  be omitted. Once you complete these steps, the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection (OCMI), will evaluate the results and accept the examination  as a credit hull exam if the vessel is in satisfactory condition. If  only divers are used for the underwater survey portion of the  examination process, you may receive credit for a period of time such  that subsequent AHEs would be conducted at intervals of twice in every  five years, with no more than three years between any two AHEs. The OCMI  may waive an underwater survey in accordance with Sec.  115.655(d)  provided that the interval does not exceed five years between any two  underwater surveys. If an underwater ROV is used as the predominate  method to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you may receive  credit up to five years. At the end of this period, you may apply for  further participation under the AHE Program.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec.  115.620: The expected hull coverage when using an ROV  must be at least 80 percent.
