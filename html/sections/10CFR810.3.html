                            <p class="depth0">As used in part 810:</p><p class="depth0">Accelerator-driven subcritical assembly system is a system comprising a ``subcritical assembly'' and a ``production accelerator'' and which is designed or used for the purpose of producing or processing special nuclear material (SNM) or which a U.S. provider of assistance knows or has reason to know will be used for the production or processing of SNM. In such a system, the ``production accelerator'' provides a source of neutrons used to effect SNM production in the ``subcritical assembly.''</p><p class="depth0">Agreement for cooperation means an agreement with another nation or group of nations concluded under sections 123 or 124 of the Atomic Energy Act.</p><p class="depth0">Atomic Energy Act means the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Classified information means National Security Information classified under Executive Order 12356 or any superseding order, or Restricted Data classified under the Atomic Energy Act.</p><p class="depth0">General authorization means an authorization granted by the Secretary of Energy under section 57b(2) of the Atomic Energy Act to provide certain assistance to foreign atomic energy activities and which is effective without a specific request to the Secretary or the issuance of an authorization to a particular person.</p><p class="depth0">IAEA means the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p class="depth0">Non-nuclear-weapon state is a country not recognized as a nuclear-weapon state by the NPT (i.e., states other than the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China).</p><p class="depth0">NNPA means the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0">NPT means the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p><p class="depth0">Nuclear reactor means an apparatus, other than a nuclear explosive device, designed or used to sustain nuclear fission in a self-supporting chain reaction.</p><p class="depth0">Open meeting means a conference, seminar, trade show or other gathering that all technically qualified members of the public may attend and at which they may make written or other personal record of the proceedings, notwithstanding that (1) a reasonable registration fee may be charged, or (2) a reasonable numerical limit exists on actual attendance.</p><p class="depth0">Operational safety means the capability of a reactor to be operated in a manner that prevents uncontrolled or inadvertent criticality, prevents or mitigates uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the environment, monitors and limits staff exposure to radiation and radioactivity, and protects off-site population from exposure to radiation or radioactivity. Operational safety may be enhanced by providing expert advice, equipment, instrumentation, technology, software, services, analyses, procedures, training, or other assistance that improves the capability of the reactor to be operated in such a manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, Government agency other than the Department of Energy, any State or political entity within a State; and (2) any legal successor, representative, agent or agency of the foregoing.

for the production or processing of SNM or which a U.S. provider of assistance knows or has reason to know will be used for the production or processing of SNM.</p><p class="depth0">Production reactor means a nuclear reactor specially designed or used primarily for the production of plutonium or uranium-233.</p><p class="depth0">Public information means: (1) Information available in periodicals, books or other print or electronic media for distribution to any member of the public, or to a community of persons such as those in a scientific, engineering, or educational discipline or in a particular commercial activity who are interested in a subject matter; (2) Information available in public libraries, public reading rooms, public document rooms, public archives, or public data banks, or in university courses; (3) Information that has been presented at an open meeting (see definition of ``open meeting''); (4) Information that has been made available internationally without restriction on its further dissemination; or (5) Information contained in an application which has been filed with the U.S. Patent Office and eligible for foreign filing under 35 U.S.C. 184 or which has been made available under 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act. Public information must be available to the public prior to or at the same time as it is transmitted to a foreign recipient.
