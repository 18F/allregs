Operational safety may be enhanced by providing expert advice, equipment, instrumentation, technology, software, services, analyses, procedures, training, or other assistance that improves the capability of the reactor to be operated in compliance with such standards, requirements or recommendations.</p><p class="depth0">Person means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any group, government agency other than DOE, or any State or political entity within a State; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any legal successor, representative, agent, or agency of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0">Production means all production phases such as: Construction, production engineering, manufacture, integration, assembly or mounting, inspection, testing, and quality assurance.</p><p class="depth0">Production accelerator means a particle accelerator especially designed, used, or intended for use with a production subcritical assembly.</p><p class="depth0">Production accelerator-driven subcritical assembly system means a system comprised of a production subcritical assembly and a production accelerator and which is especially designed, used, or intended for the production of plutonium or uranium-233. In such a system, the production accelerator target provides a source of neutrons used to effect special nuclear material production in the production subcritical assembly.</p><p class="depth0">Production reactor means a nuclear reactor especially designed or used primarily for the production of plutonium or uranium-233.</p><p class="depth0">Production subcritical assembly means an apparatus that contains source material or special nuclear material to produce a nuclear fission chain reaction that is not self-sustaining and that is especially designed, used, or intended for the production of plutonium or uranium-233.</p><p class="depth0">Publicly available information means information in any form that is generally accessible, without restriction, to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Publicly available technology means technology that is already published or has been prepared for publication; arises during, or results from, fundamental research; or is included in an application filed with the U.S. Patent Office and eligible for foreign filing under 35 U.S.C. 184.</p><p class="depth0">Restricted Data means all data concerning:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The production of special nuclear material; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act.</p><p class="depth0">Secretary means the Secretary of Energy.</p><p class="depth0">Sensitive nuclear technology means any information (including information incorporated in a production or utilization facility or important component part thereof) which is not available to the public (see definition of ``publicly available information'') and which is important to the design, construction, fabrication, operation, or maintenance of a uranium enrichment or nuclear fuel reprocessing facility or a facility for the production of heavy water, but shall not include Restricted Data controlled pursuant to chapter 12 of the Atomic Energy Act.
