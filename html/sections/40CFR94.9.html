                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The general standards and requirements in Sec. 94.7 and the emission standards in Sec. 94.8 apply to each new engine throughout its useful life period. The useful life is specified both in years and in hours of operation, and ends when either of the values (hours of operation or years) is exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum useful life is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 10 years or 1,000 hours of operation for recreational Category 1 engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 10 years or 10,000 hours of operation for commercial Category 1 engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 10 years or 20,000 hours of operation for Category 2 engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 3 years or 10,000 hours of operation for Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer shall specify a longer useful life if the engine is designed to remain in service longer than the applicable minimum useful life

without being rebuilt. A manufacturer's recommended time to remanufacture/rebuild longer than the minimum useful life is one indicator of a longer design life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers may request in the application for certification that we approve a shorter useful life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, the demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, the demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. The demonstration must also include recommended overhaul intervals, any mechanical warranty offered for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. The demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 1,000 hours of operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recommended overhaul interval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The mechanical warranty for the engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification is the process by which manufacturers apply for and obtain certificates of conformity from EPA, which allows the manufacturer to introduce into commerce new marine engines for sale or use in the U.S.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with the applicable emission standards by an engine family shall be demonstrated by the certifying manufacturer before a certificate of conformity may be issued under Sec. 94.208. Manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance using emission data, measured using the procedures specified in Subpart B of this part, from a low hour engine. A development engine that is equivalent in design to the marine engines being certified may be used for Category 2 or Category 3 certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission values to compare with the standards shall be the emission values of a low hour engine, or a development engine, adjusted by the deterioration factors developed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 94.219. Before comparing any emission value with the standard, round it to the same number of significant figures contained in the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator may limit the applicability of exhaust emission requirements of Sec. 94.8(e) as necessary for safety or to otherwise protect the engine.
