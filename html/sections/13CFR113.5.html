                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cooperation and assistance: SBA shall to the fullest extent  practicable seek the cooperation of applicants and recipients in  obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and  guidance to applicants and recipients to help them comply voluntarily  with this part. Recipients are expected to continually evaluate their  compliance status, with the assistance of interested persons, including  handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance reports: Each applicant or recipient shall keep such  records and submit to SBA timely, complete and accurate compliance  reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information,  as SBA may determine to be necessary to enable SBA to ascertain whether  the applicant or recipient has complied or is complying with this part.  In the case of a small business concern which receives financial  assistance from a development company or from a small business  investment company, such concern shall submit to the company such  information as may be necessary to enable the company to meet its  reporting requirements under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to sources of information: Each applicant or recipient  shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its  books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its  facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part.  Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the  exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person; and  such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this  information, the applicant or recipient shall so certify in its report  and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain this information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information to the Public. Each recipient shall make available  to persons entitled under this part to protection against discrimination  by the recipient such information as SBA may find necessary to apprise  them of their rights to such protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In some situations even though past discriminatory practices  have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to  impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts  required of the applicant or recipient under Sec. 113.5(b) to provide  information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights  of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these  consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient  to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to  racial, qualified handicapped, nationality groups and persons who  because of their sex were previously subjected to discrimination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Even though an applicant or recipient has never used  discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates  may not in fact be equally available to some racial, qualified  handicapped, or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient  may properly give special consideration to race, color, religion, sex,  marital status, qualified handicap or national origin to make the  opportunities more widely available to such groups.</p>
