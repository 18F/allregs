                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Positions to be aggregated. The position limits set forth in Sec. 151.4 shall apply to all positions in accounts for which any person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly holds positions or controls trading and to positions held by two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading of the position were done by, a single individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ownership of accounts generally. For the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in Sec. 151.4, except for the ownership interest of limited partners, shareholders, members of a limited liability company, beneficiaries of a trust or similar type of pool participant in a commodity pool subject to the provisos set forth in paragraph (c) of this section or in accounts or positions in multiple pools as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, any person holding positions in more than one account, or holding accounts or positions in which the person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly has a 10 percent or greater ownership or equity interest, must aggregate all such accounts or positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ownership by limited partners, shareholders or other pool participants. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, a person that is a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant with an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in a pooled account or positions who is also a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, a person that is a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant with an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in a pooled account or positions who is also a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pool operator has, and enforces, written procedures to preclude the person from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about the trading or positions of the pool;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person does not have direct, day-to-day supervisory authority or control over the pool's trading decisions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The pool operator has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section on behalf of the person or class of persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A commodity pool operator having ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in an account or positions as a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant must aggregate those accounts or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by the commodity pool operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each limited partner, shareholder, or other similar type of pool participant having an ownership or equity interest of 25 percent or greater in a commodity pool the operator of which is exempt from registration under Sec. 4.13 of this chapter must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identical trading. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in Sec. 151.4, any person that holds or controls the trading of

positions, by power of attorney or otherwise, in more than one account, or that holds or controls trading of accounts or positions in multiple pools with identical trading strategies must aggregate all such accounts or positions that a person holds or controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Trading control by futures commission merchants. The position limits set forth in Sec. 151.4 shall be construed to apply to all positions held by a futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates in a discretionary account, or in an account which is part of, or participates in, or receives trading advice from a customer trading program of a futures commission merchant or any of the officers, partners, or employees of such futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A trader other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each trading decision of the discretionary account or the customer trading program is determined independently of all trading decisions in other accounts which the futures commission merchant or the affiliate holds, has a financial interest of 10 percent or more in, or controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Independent Account Controller. An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in Sec. 151.1, except for the spot month provided in physical-delivery Referenced Contracts, provided, however, that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in Sec. 151.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additional requirements for exemption of Affiliated Entities. If the independent account controller is affiliated with the eligible entity or another independent account controller, each of the affiliated entities must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include document routing and other procedures or security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Market such trading systems separately; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Solicit funds for such trading by separate disclosure documents that meet the standards of Sec. 4.24 or Sec. 4.34 of this chapter, as applicable where such disclosure documents are required under part 4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exemption for underwriting. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice filing for exemption. (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (c), (e), (f), or (i) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice, and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (c), (e), (f), or (i) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice, and shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the relevant circumstances that warrant disaggregation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement certifying that the conditions set forth in the applicable aggregation exemption provision has been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon call by the Commission, any person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section shall provide to

the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event of a material change to the information provided in the notice filed under this paragraph, an updated or amended notice shall promptly be filed detailing the material change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A notice shall be submitted in the form and manner provided for in Sec. 151.10.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exemption for federal law information sharing restriction. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a person is not subject to the aggregation requirements of this section if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation would cause either person to violate Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder and provided that such a person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation. Provided, however, that such person file a prior notice with the Commission detailing the circumstances of the exemption and an opinion of counsel that the sharing of information would cause a violation of Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder.</p>
