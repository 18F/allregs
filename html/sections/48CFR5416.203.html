                                Sec. 5416.203  Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment.

Sec. 5416.203-1  Description.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(S-90)</em> Adjustments based on established prices. Established prices may reflect industry-wide and/or geographically based market price fluctuations for commodity groups, specific supplies or services, or contract end items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(S-90)</em> Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or materials. These price adjustments may also be based on increases or decreases in indexes for commodity groups, specific supplies or services, or contract end items.


Sec. 5416.203-3  Limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(S-90)</em> A fixed price contract with economic price adjustment may also be used to provide for price adjustments authorized in this section.


Sec. 5416.203-4  Contract clauses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(S-90)</em> When the contracting officer determines that an existing EPA clause is not appropriate, the contracting officer may develop and use another EPA clause in accordance with 5416.203-1 (a)(S-90) or (c)(S-90). Established prices and cost indexes need not reflect changes in the costs or established prices of a specific contractor. The established price or cost index may be derived from sales prices in the marketplace, quotes, or assessments as reported or made available in a consistent manner in a publication, electronic database, or other form, by an independent trade association, Governmental body, or other third party independent of the contractor. More than one established price or cost index may be combined in a formula for economic price adjustment purposes in the absence of an appropriate single price or cost index.</p>
