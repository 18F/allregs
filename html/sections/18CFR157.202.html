                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Terms defined in the Natural Gas Policy Act of  1978 (NGPA) shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this subpart  as they have under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subpart F definitions. For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certificate holder means any interstate pipeline with an  effective blanket certificate issued pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Eligible facility means, except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section, any facility subject to the Natural Gas Act  jurisdiction of the Commission that is necessary to provide service  within existing certificated levels. Eligible facility also includes any  gas supply facility or any facility, including receipt points, needed by  the certificate holder to receive gas into its system for further  transport or storage, and interconnecting facilities between  transporters that transport natural gas under part 284 of this chapter.  Further, eligible facility includes main line, lateral, and compressor  replacements that do not qualify under Sec. 2.55(b) of this chapter  because they will result in an incidental increase in the capacity of  main line facilities, or because they will not satisfy the location or  work space requirements of Sec. 2.55(b). Replacements must be done for  sound engineering purposes. Replacements for the primary purpose of  creating additional main line capacity are not eligible facilities;  however, replacements and the modification of facilities to rearrange  gas flows or increase compression for the primary purpose of restoring  service in an emergency due to sudden unforeseen damage to main line  facilities are eligible facilities. Eligible facility also includes  auxiliary installations and observation wells which do not qualify under  Sec. 2.55(a) of this chapter because they will not satisfy the location  or work space requirements of Sec. 2.55(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusions: ``Eligible facility'' does not include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A main line of a transmission system, except replacement  facilities covered under Sec. 157.202(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An extension of a main line, except replacement facilities  covered under Sec. 157.202(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A facility, including compression and looping, that alters the  capacity of a main line, except replacement facilities and facility  modifications covered under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A facility required to test or develop an underground storage  field or that alters the certificated capacity, deliverability, or  storage boundary, or a facility required to store gas above ground in  either a gaseous or liquified state, or a facility used to receive gas  from plants manufacturing synthetic gas or from plants gasifying  liquefied natural gas, or wells needed to utilize an underground storage  field.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Delivery points under Sec. 157.211.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Temporary compression under Sec. 157.209;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A facility that crosses a state line and is constructed for the  primary   purpose of transporting gas which is also transported by an intrastate  pipeline under section 311(a)(2) of the NGPA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facility does not include the items described in Sec. 2.55 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Temporary compression means compressor facilities installed and  operated at existing compressor locations for the limited purpose of  temporarily replacing existing permanent compressor facilities that are  undergoing maintenance or repair or that are pending permanent  replacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Main line means the principal transmission facilities of a  pipeline system extending from supply areas to market areas and does not  include small diameter supply or delivery laterals or gathering lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Miscellaneous rearrangement of any facility means any  rearrangement of a facility, excluding underground storage injection/ withdrawal wells, that does not result in any change of service rendered  by means of the facilities involved, including changes in existing field  operations or relocation of existing facilities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On the same property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When required by highway construction, dam construction,  encroachment of residential, commercial, or industrial areas, erosion,  or the expansion or change of course of rivers, streams or creeks, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To respond to other natural forces beyond the certificate  holder's control when necessary to ensure safety or maintain the  operational integrity of the certificate holder's facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Project means a unit of improvement or construction that is used  and useful upon completion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Project cost means the total actual cost of constructing the  jurisdictional portions of a project. In the case of a project  constructed jointly by more than one interstate pipeline, the project  cost is the total cost, irrespective of the amount paid by each  pipeline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Right-of-way grantor means (i) a person who grants a right-of- way easement to the certificate holder; or (ii) any successor to an  interest which is subject to the easement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Delivery point means a tap and/or metering and appurtenant  facilities, such as heaters, minor gas conditioning, treatment,  odorization, and similar equipment, necessary to enable the certificate  holder to deliver gas to any party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Sensitive environmental area means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The habitats of species which have been identified as endangered  or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (Pub.
