                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator or authorized representative shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review each application received and determine whether such application is complete and properly executed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When appropriate, notify the applicant in writing of any incompleteness or error in the application and return the application for correction and completion;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine, after appropriate investigation, whether the applicant has complied with the requirements of the Act and these regulations, and if appropriate, issue a Certificate of
Registration or a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration authorizing the performance of one or more activities permitted under the Act;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authorize the activity of transporting a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, subject to the maximum number of workers authorized to be transported under the vehicle liability policy and as indicated on the face of the Certificate of Registration, only upon receipt of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement in the manner prescribed by the Secretary identifying each vehicle to be used, or caused to be used, by the applicant for the transportation of any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker during the period for which registration is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written proof that every such vehicle which is under the applicant's ownership or control, is in compliance with the vehicle safety requirements of the Act and these regulations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written proof that every such vehicle is in compliance with the insurance requirements of the Act and these regulations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authorize the activity of driving a vehicle to transport a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker only upon receipt of (1) A doctor's certificate on the prescribed form, with an initial application for a Certificate of Registration or a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate, and, when applying for a renewal, a new completed doctor's certificate if the previous doctor's certificate is more than three years old; and (2) evidence of a valid and appropriate license, as provided by State law, to operate the vehicle; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Authorize the activity of housing a migrant agricultural worker only upon receipt of (1) A statement identifying each facility or real property to be used for housing a migrant agricultural worker during the period for which registration is sought; and (2) if the facility or real property is or will be owned or controlled by the applicant, written proof that the facility or real property complies with the applicable Federal and State standards of health and safety. Such written proof may be either a certification issued by a State or local health authority or other appropriate agency, or a copy of a written request for the inspection of a facility or real property made to the appropriate State or local agency at least forty-five days prior to the date on which the facility or real property is to be occupied by migrant agricultural workers, dated and signed by the applicant or other person who owns or controls the facility or real property. If housing authorization is issued based on a written request for inspection and the housing facility or real property is subsequently inspected and does not meet the appropriate standards, the housing authorization is null and void. Should the required written proof for housing authorization be unavailable at the time of filing an application, the applicant must attest in writing that the applicant will not house any migrant agricultural worker in any facility or real property owned or controlled by the applicant, until such applicant shall have submitted all necessary written proof and obtained a Farm Labor Contractor Certificate of Registration showing that housing in the facility or real property is authorized by the Secretary of Labor. In such event, if otherwise eligible, the applicant will be issued a Certificate of Registration without a housing authorization. This certificate may be amended to include an authorization to house at such time as the required proof is forthcoming.
