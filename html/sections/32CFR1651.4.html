                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An appeal to the district appeal board is determined by the  classification of the registrant in a class other than 1-A or by its  refusal to take such action. No action shall be taken by the board in  the absence of a quorum of its prescribed membership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to the adjudication of an appeal, the clerk of the appeal  board or any compensated employee authorized to perform the  administrative duties of the board shall review the file to insure that  no procedural errors have occurred during the history of the current  claim. Files containing procedural errors will be returned to the local   board that classified the registrant for any additional processing  necessary to correct such errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Files containing procedural errors that were not detected during  the initial screening but which subsequently surfaced during processing  by the appeal board, will be acted on and the board will take such  action necessary to correct the errors and process the appeal to  completion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A board shall consider appeals in the order of their having been  filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of the registrant's file, a board shall ascertain  whether the registrant has requested a personal appearance before the  board. If no such request has been made, the board may classify the  registrant on the bases of the material in his file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Not less than 10 days (unless the registrant requests an earlier  appointment) in advance of the meeting at which his classification will  be considered, the board shall inform any registrant with respect to  whom the Director of Selective Service has appealed or who has requested  a personal appearance that he may appear at such meeting and present  written evidence bearing on his classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> During the personal appearance, only the registrant may address  the board or respond to questions of the board. The registrant will not  be permitted to present witnesses at the personal appearance before the  district appeal board. A registrant may, however, be accompanied by an  advisor of his choosing and may confer with the advisor before  responding to an inquiry or statement by the board: Provided, That,  those conferences do not substantially interfere with or unreasonably  delay the orderly process of the personal appearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If, in the opinion of the board, the informal, administrative  nature of the hearing is unduly disrupted by the presence of an advisor  during the personal appearance, the board chairman may require the  advisor to leave the hearing room. In such case, the board chairman  shall put a statement of reasons for his action in the registrant's  file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a registrant who has filed a claim for whom a personal  appearance has been scheduled, fails to appear in accord with such  schedule, the board shall consider any written explanation of such  failure that has been filed within 5 days (or extension thereof granted  by the board) after such failure to appear. If the board determines that  the registrant's failure to appear was for good cause it shall  reschedule the registrant's personal appearance. If the board does not  receive a timely written explanation of the registrant's failure to  appear for his scheduled personal appearance or if the board determines  that the registrant's failure to appear was not for good cause, the  registrant will be deemed to have abandoned his request for personal  appearance and he will be classified on the basis of the material in his  file. The board will notify the registrant in writing of its action  under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A quorum of the prescribed membership of a board shall be  present during all personal appearances. Only those members of the board  before whom the registrant appears shall classify him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> At any personal appearance, the registrant may: Present his oral  testimony; point out the class or classes in which he thinks he should  have been placed; and direct attention to any information in his file.  The registrant may present any additional written information he  believes will assist the board in determining his proper classification.  The information furnished should be as concise as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The registrant may summarize in writing the oral information  that he presented. Such summary shall be placed in the registrant's  file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A summary will be made of oral testimony given by the registrant  at his personal appearance and such summary shall be placed in the  registrant's file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A district appeal board shall classify a registrant who has  requested a personal appearance after he:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has appeared before the board; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has withdrawn his request to appear; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has abandoned his right to an opportunity to appear; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has failed to appear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> In considering a registrant's appeal, a board shall not receive  or consider any information other than the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information contained in the registrant's file; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oral statements by the registrant during the registrant's  personal appearance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written evidence submitted by the registrant to the board during  his personal appearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> In the event a board classifies the registrant in a class other  than that which he requested, it shall record its reasons therefor in  the file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The making of verbatim transcripts, and the using of cameras or  other recording devices are prohibited in proceedings before the board.  This does not prevent the registrant or Selective Service from making a  written summary of his testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Proceedings before the appeal boards shall be open to the public  only upon the request of or with the permission of the registrant. The  board chairman may limit the number of persons attending the hearing in  order to maintain order. If during the hearing the presence of non- participants in the proceedings becomes disruptive the chairman may  close the hearing.
