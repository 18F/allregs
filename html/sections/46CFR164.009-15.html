                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section contain the  test procedures for each material submitted for approval, except  fiberglass and other materials that melt at 750[deg] 10 [deg]C. Paragraph (l) of this section contains test  procedures for fiberglass and other materials that melt at 750[deg]  10 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of specimens. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated laboratory prepares  5 cylindrical specimens representative of the properties of the sample  submitted for testing. The dimensions of each specimen are as follows:  diameter: 45( + 2/-0) mm height: 50 3 mm volume: 80 5 cm\3\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the height of the sample, except a composite material, is  less than 47 mm, the specimens prepared consist of layers of the sample.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the sample is a composite material and has a height that is  not 50 3mm, the layers of the specimen prepared  are proportional in thickness to the layers of the sample.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The top and bottom faces of each specimen prepared are the faces  of the material as manufactured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it is not practicable to prepare a specimen by the procedures  described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section, the test  is performed on five specimens of each component of the sample made to  the dimensions prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditioning of specimen. Each specimen is conditioned for at  least 20 hours in a ventilated oven maintained at 60 5 [deg]C. and is then cooled to room temperature in a  desiccator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Weight of specimen. The weight of each conditioned specimen  after cooling is determined before it is tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Placement of specimen in holder. After a specimen is conditioned  and weighed, it is placed in the specimen holder. A specimen that is  made of layers of a composite material is held firmly together in the  specimen holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Attachment of thermocouples. After the specimen is placed in the  specimen holder, the thermocouples are attached to the specimen as  follows: A vertical hole with a diameter of 2 mm and a depth that is  half the height of the specimen is made in the center of the top of the  specimen. The specimen thermocouple is then inserted into the hole so  that its hot junction is at the center of the specimen. The surface  thermocouple is put in contact with the surface of the specimen at its  mid-height.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Preparation of the apparatus. The apparatus is examined to  determine whether it is in good working order and to ensure that the  equipment is protected against drafts and is not exposed to direct  sunlight or artificial illumination. The furnace temperature is  stabilized at 750 [deg]C. 10 [deg]C. and kept at  that temperature for the duration of the test. The furnace temperature  is stabilized when no adjustments are needed in the energy input to the  furnace to keep the temperature constant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Insertion of specimen. After the furnace temperature is  stabilized for at least 10 minutes, the specimen is inserted into the  furnace. The insertion is completed within 5 seconds. The specimen is  positioned so that the hot junction of the surface thermocouple is  diametrically opposite the hot junction of the furnace thermocouple.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Heating period. The heating period begins upon insertion of the  specimen into the furnace and continues for 20 minutes, or until peak  temperatures have passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Test observations. Temperature measurements at each thermocouple  are made at intervals of not more than 10 seconds during the heating  period, and note is taken of the occurrence and duration of any flaming.  At the end of the heating period, the specimen is removed from the  furnace and weighed while still hot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Test results. Material is approved under this subpart if the  test results of the sample submitted are within the following limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The highest temperature recorded for each specimen during the  test by the furnace thermocouple, when averaged with the highest  temperatures recorded for the other specimens, is not more than 50  [deg]C. above the stabilized furnace temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The highest temperature recorded for each specimen during the  test by the surface thermocouple, when averaged with the highest  temperatures recorded for the other specimens, is not more than 50  [deg]C. above the stabilized furnace temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The duration of flaming of each specimen during the test, when  averaged with duration of flaming recorded for the other specimens, is  not more than 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The average weight loss of the specimens after heating is not  more than 50 percent of their average weight after conditioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Fiberglass and other materials that melt at 750 [deg]C. 10 [deg]C. If the material submitted for approval is  fiberglass or other material that melts at 750[deg] 10 [deg]C., it is tested as described in paragraphs (b)  through (k) of this section, except the average weight loss of the  sample is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Five cylindrical specimens in addition to the five cylindrical  specimens required in paragraph (b) of this section are prepared as  described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each of the additional specimens is placed on a weighing dish  and both the specimen and the weighing dish are conditioned as described  in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The weight of each specimen and its weighing dish is determined  as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After a specimen and weighing dish are conditioned and weighed,  they are placed in the specimen holder with the specimen supported by  weighing dish. No specimen thermocouple or surface thermocouple is  attached to the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The apparatus is prepared as described in paragraph (g) of this  section, and after the furnace temperature has stabilized for at least  10 minutes, the specimen and weighing dish are inserted into the  furnace. The specimen and weighing dish are then heated for 20 minutes  or until peak temperatures have passed. At the end of the heating  period, the specimen and weighing dish are removed from the furnace and  weighed while still hot.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The average weight loss of the specimens after heating may not  be more than 50 percent of their average weight before heating.</p>
