The information in paragraph (b)(4) shall be stated for that period as well as for the statement period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statement disclosures. If a credit union mails or delivers a periodic statement, the statement shall include the following disclosures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual percentage yield earned.

Except as provided in Sec. 707.11(a)(1) of this part, when fees of the same type are imposed more than once in a statement period, a credit union may itemize each fee separately or group the fees together and disclose a total dollar amount for all fees of that type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Length of period. The total number of days in the statement period, or the beginning and ending dates of the period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Aggregate fee disclosure.
