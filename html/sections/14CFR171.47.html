For example, if a reflector screen for the  antenna array is required to overcome a siting problem, the area to the  rear of the localizer may be made unusable and should be so advertised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A third marker beacon (inner marker) is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The frequency tolerance of the radio frequency carrier must not  exceed plus or minus 0.002 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ground inspection consists of an examination of the design  features of the equipment to determine that there will not be conditions  that will allow unsafe operations because of component failure or  deterioration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The monitor is checked periodically, during the in-service test  evaluation period, for calibration and stability. These tests, and  ground checks of glide slope and localizer radiation characteristics,  are conducted in accordance with FAA Handbooks AF P 6750.1 and AF P  6750.2 ``Maintenance Instructions for ILS Localizer Equipment'' and  ``Maintenance Instructions for ILS Glide Slope Equipment''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Flight tests to determine the facility's adequacy for  operational requirements and compliance with applicable ``Standards and  Recommended Practices'' are conducted in accord- ance with the ``U.S.  Standard Flight Inspection Manual'', particularly section 217.
