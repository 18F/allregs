                            <p class="depth0">The terms of settlement in lieu of restoration, negotiated with the  lessor, will be embodied in a supplemental agreement to the lease,  antedating termination, substantially in accordance with ENG Form 341,  Supplemental Agreement Transferring Improvements to Lessor. Supplemental  agreements may be used to effect restoration settlements of obligations  incurred under permits, trespass right agreements, and other unnumbered  contracts for the temporary use of land. Restoration settlements may  also be effected even though the premises were occupied rent free and  without formal contract, provided use of the premises was authorized  properly by the Government (Decision of the Comptroller General B-63340,  February 1947). Care should be exercised in determining the existence   and extent of the legal obligation of the Government to restore. Payment  will not be made for doubtful items; instead, the other party to the  agreement will be advised of his right to submit a claim. On the other  hand, every effort will be made to agree upon a reasonable settlement as  to items for which the Government is legally responsible.</p>
