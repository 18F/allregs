A brewer may be refunded the tax excessively paid on beer subject to the conditions outlined in Sec. 25.285.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rate of tax. Brewers who have filed the notice required by Sec. 25.167 and who have paid the tax on beer at the reduced rate of tax shall make claims for refund or relief of tax, or adjustments on the tax return, based upon the lower rate of tax. However, a brewer may make adjustments or claims for refund or relief of tax based on the higher rate of tax if the brewer can establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the tax was paid or determined at the higher rate of tax.
