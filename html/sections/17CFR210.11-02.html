                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Objective. Pro forma financial information should provide  investors with information about the continuing impact of a particular  transaction by showing how it might have affected historical financial  statements if the transaction had been consummated at an earlier time.  Such statements should assist investors in analyzing the future  prospects of the registrant because they illustrate the possible scope  of the change in the registrant's historical financial position and  results of operations caused by the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and content. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pro forma financial information shall  consist of a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma condensed  statements of income, and accompanying explanatory notes. In certain  circumstances (i.e., where a limited number of pro forma adjustments are  required and those adjustments are easily understood), a narrative  description of the pro forma effects of the transaction may be furnished  in lieu of the statements described herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pro forma financial information shall be accompanied by an  introductory paragraph which briefly sets forth a description of (i) the  transaction, (ii) the entities involved, and (iii) the periods for which  the pro forma information is presented. In addition, an explanation of  what the pro forma presentation shows shall be set forth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pro forma condensed financial information need only include  major captions (i.e., the numbered captions) prescribed by the  applicable sections of this Regulation. Where any major balance sheet  caption is less than 10 percent of total assets, the caption may be  combined with others. When any major income statement caption is less  than 15 percent of average net income attributable to the registrant for  the most recent three fiscal years, the caption may be combined with  others. In calculating average net income attributable to the  registrant, loss years should be excluded unless losses were incurred in  each of the most recent three years, in which case the average loss  shall be used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, de  minimis amounts need not be shown separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pro forma statements shall ordinarily be in columnar form  showing   condensed historical statements, pro forma adjustments, and the pro  forma results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The pro forma condensed income statement shall disclose income  (loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or credits  directly attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurring charges  or credits and related tax effects which result directly from the  transaction and which will be included in the income of the registrant  within the 12 months succeeding the transaction shall be disclosed  separately. It should be clearly indicated that such charges or credits  were not considered in the pro forma condensed income statement. If the  transaction for which pro forma financial information is presented  relates to the disposition of a business, the pro forma results should  give effect to the disposition and be presented under an appropriate  caption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed income  statement shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at  the beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall include adjustments  which give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the  transaction, (ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the  registrant, and (iii) factually supportable. Pro forma adjustments  related to the pro forma condensed balance sheet shall be computed  assuming the transaction was consummated at the end of the most recent  period for which a balance sheet is required by Sec. 210.3-01 and shall  include adjustments which give effect to events that are directly  attributable to the transaction and factually supportable regardless of  whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring. All  adjustments should be referenced to notes which clearly explain the  assumptions involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Historical primary and fully diluted per share data based on  continuing operations (or net income if the registrant does not report  either discontinued operations, extraordinary items, or the cumulative  effects of accounting changes) for the registrant, and primary and fully  diluted pro forma per share data based on continuing operations before  nonrecurring charges or credits directly attributable to the transaction  shall be presented on the face of the pro forma condensed income  statement together with the number of shares used to compute such per  share data. For transactions involving the issuance of securities, the  number of shares used in the calculation of the pro forma per share data  should be based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during the period adjusted to give effect to shares subsequently issued  or assumed to be issued had the particular transaction or event taken  place at the beginning of the period presented. If a convertible  security is being issued in the transaction, consideration should be  given to the possible dilution of the pro forma per share data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the transaction is structured in such a manner that  significantly different results may occur, additional pro forma  presentations shall be made which give effect to the range of possible  results.  Instructions: 1. The historical statement of income used in the pro  forma financial information shall not report operations of a segment  that has been discontinued, extraordinary items, or the cumulative  effects of accounting changes. If the historical statement of income  includes such items, only the portion of the income statement through  ``income from continuing operations'' (or the appropriate modification  thereof) should be used in preparing pro forma results.</p><p class="depth3">2. For a business combination, pro forma adjustments for the income  statement shall include amortization, depreciation and other adjustments  based on the allocated purchase price of net assets acquired. In some  transactions, such as in financial institution acquisitions, the  purchase adjustments may include significant discounts of the historical  cost of the acquired assets to their fair value at the acquisition date.  When such adjustments will result in a significant effect on earnings  (losses) in periods immediately subsequent to the acquisition which will  be progressively eliminated over a relatively short period, the effect  of the purchase adjustments on reported results of operations for each  of the next five years should be disclosed in a note.</p><p class="depth3">3. For a disposition transaction, the pro forma financial  information shall begin with the historical financial statements of the  existing entity and show the deletion of the business to be divested  along with the pro forma adjustments necessary to arrive at the   remainder of the existing entity. For example, pro forma adjustments  would include adjustments of interest expense arising from revised debt  structures and expenses which will be or have been incurred on behalf of  the business to be divested such as advertising costs, executive  salaries and other costs.</p><p class="depth3">4. For entities which were previously a component of another entity,  pro forma adjustments should include adjustments similar in nature to  those referred to in Instruction 3 above. Adjustments may also be  necessary when charges for corporate overhead, interest, or income taxes  have been allocated to the entity on a basis other than one deemed  reasonable by management.</p><p class="depth3">5. Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of real estate operations  or properties for the pro forma income statement shall include a  depreciation charge based on the new accounting basis for the assets,  interest financing on any additional or refinanced debt, and other  appropriate adjustments that can be factually supported. See also  Instruction 4 above.</p><p class="depth3">6. When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred or is  probable during a fiscal year, the pro forma financial information may  be presented on a combined basis; however, in some circumstances (e.g.,  depending upon the combination of probable and consummated transactions,  and the nature of the filing) it may be more useful to present the pro  forma financial information on a disaggregated basis even though some or  all of the transactions would not meet the tests of significance  individually. For combined presentations, a note should explain the  various transactions and disclose the maximum variances in the pro forma  financial information which would occur for any of the possible  combinations. If the pro forma financial information is presented in a  proxy or information statement for purposes of obtaining shareholder  approval of one of the transactions, the effects of that transaction  must be clearly set forth.</p><p class="depth3">7. Tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally should be  calculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for which  pro forma condensed income statements are presented and should be  reflected as a separate pro forma adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periods to be presented. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pro forma condensed balance sheet  as of the end of the most recent period for which a consolidated balance  sheet of the registrant is required by Sec. 210.3-01 shall be filed  unless the transaction is already reflected in such balance sheet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be filed for  only the most recent fiscal year and for the period from the most recent  fiscal year end to the most recent interim date for which a balance  sheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of income may be  filed for the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year.  A pro forma condensed statement of income shall not be filed when the  historical income statement reflects the transaction for the entire  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a business combination accounted for as a pooling of  interests, the pro forma income statements (which are in effect a  restatement of the historical income statements as if the combination  had been consummated) shall be filed for all periods for which  historical income statements of the registrant are required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be presented  using the registrant's fiscal year end. If the most recent fiscal year  end of any other entity involved in the transaction differs from the  registrant's most recent fiscal year end by more than 93 days, the other  entity's income statement shall be brought up to within 93 days of the  registrant's most recent fiscal year end, if practicable. This updating  could be accomplished by adding subsequent interim period results to the  most recent fiscal year-end information and deducting the comparable  preceding year interim period results. Disclosure shall be made of the  periods combined and of the sales or revenues and income for any periods  which were excluded from or included more than once in the condensed pro  forma income statements (e.g., an interim period that is included both  as part of the fiscal year and the subsequent interim period). For  investment companies subject to Sec. Sec. 210.6-01 to 210.6-10, the  periods covered by the pro forma statements must be the same.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whenever unusual events enter into the determination of the  results shown for the most recently completed fiscal year, the effect of  such unusual events should be disclosed and consideration should be  given to presenting a pro forma condensed income statement for the most  recent twelve-month period in addition to those required in   paragraph (c)(2)(i) above if the most recent twelve-month period is more  representative of normal operations.  [47 FR 29837, July 9, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 49533, Dec. 3, 1985; 74  FR 18616, Apr. 23, 2009]</p>
