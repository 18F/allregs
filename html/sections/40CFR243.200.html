                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All solid wastes (or materials which have been separated for the purpose of recycling) shall be stored in such a manner that they do not constitute a fire, health, or safety hazard or provide food or harborage for vectors, and shall be contained or bundled so as not to result in spillage. All solid waste containing food wastes shall be securely stored in covered or closed containers which are nonabsorbent, leakproof, durable, easily cleanable (if reusable), and designed for safe handling. Containers shall be of an adequate size and in sufficient numbers to contain all food wastes, rubbish, and ashes that a residence or other establishment generates in the period of time between collections. Containers shall be maintained in a clean condition so that they do not constitute a nuisance, and to retard the harborage, feeding, and breeding of vectors. When serviced, storage containers should be emptied completely of all solid waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Storage of bulky wastes shall include, but is not limited to, removing all doors from large household appliances and covering the item(s) to reduce the problems of an attractive nuisance, and the accumulation of solid waste and water in and around the bulky items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reusable waste containers which are emptied manually shall not exceed 75 pounds (34.05 kg) when filled, and shall be capable of being serviced without the collector coming into physical contact with the solid waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the design of all buildings or other facilities which are constructed, modified, or leased after the effective date of these guidelines, there shall be provisions for storage in accordance with these guidelines which will accommodate the volume of solid waste anticipated, which may be easily cleaned and maintained, and which will allow for efficient, safe collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Waste containers used for the storage of solid waste (or materials which have been separated for recycling) must meet the standards established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for waste containers as follows: Waste Containers--Safety Requirements, 1994, American National Standards Institute, ANSI Z245.30-1994; and Waste Containers--Compatibility Dimensions, 1996, American National Standards Institute, ANSI Z245.60-1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may obtain a copy from American National Standards Institute, 11 W. 42nd Street, New York, NY 10036. You may inspect a copy at the Environmental Protection Agency's RCRA Information Center, 1235 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

[41 FR 6769, Feb. 13, 1976, as amended at 64 FR 70606, Dec. 17, 1999; 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004]


Sec. 243.200-2  Recommended procedures: Design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reusable waste containers should be constructed of corrosion resistant metal or other material which will not absorb water, grease, or oil. The containers should be leakproof, including sides, seams, and bottoms, and be durable enough to withstand anticipated usage without rusting, cracking, or deforming in a manner that would impair serviceability. The interior of the container should be smooth without interior projections or rough seams which would make it difficult to clean or interfere with its emptying. The exterior of the container should be safe for

handling with no cracks, holes, or jagged edges. Containers should be stored on a firm, level, well-drained surface which is large enough to accommodate all of the containers and which is maintained in a clean, spillage-free condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reusable waste containers which are emptied manually should have a capacity of no more than 35 gallons (132.51) in volume, unless they are mounted on casters and can be serviced by being rolled to the collection vehicle and tilted for emptying. The containers should be constructed with rounded edges and tapered sides with the larger diameter at the top of the container to facilitate discharge of the solid waste by gravity. Containers should have two handles or bails located directly opposite one another on the sides of the container. Containers should have covers which are tight-fitting to resist the intrusion of water and vectors, and should be equipped with a suitable handle. Containers should be designed so that they cannot be tipped over easily.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reusable waste containers which are emptied mechanically should be designed or equipped to prevent spillage or leakage during on-site storage, collection, or transport. The container should be easily cleanable and designed to allow easy access for depositing the waste and removing it by gravity or by mechanical means. The containers should be easily accessible to the collection vehicle in an area which can safely accommodate the dimensions and weight of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Single-use plastic and paper bags should meet the National Sanitation Foundation Standard No. 31 for polyethylene refuse bags and Standard No. 32 for paper refuse bags, respectively. However, such bags do not need to have been certified by the National Sanitation Foundation. Single-use bags containing food wastes should be stored within the confines of a building or container between collection periods.</p>
