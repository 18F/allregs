                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Trade secrets. You may be able to withhold the name of a  specific chemical when submitting MSDS reporting or inventory reporting  information if that chemical name is claimed as a trade secret. The  requirements for withholding trade secret information are set forth in  EPCRA section 322 and implemented in 40 CFR part 350. If you are  withholding the name of a specific chemical as a trade secret in  accordance with trade secrecy requirements, you must report the generic  class or category that is structurally descriptive of the chemical along  with all other required information. You must also submit the withheld  information to EPA and must adequately substantiate your claim. A Form  for substantiating trade secret claims is available at the Agency Web  site at http://www.epa.gov/emergencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Confidential location information. You may request that the SERC  or the LEPC not disclose to the public the location of any specific  chemical required to be submitted in Tier II information. If you make  such a request, the SERC or LEPC must not disclose the location of the  specific chemical. If you use the Tier II Form to report your inventory  information, you can choose to report confidential location information  for a specific chemical on the Confidential Location Information Sheet,  which must be attached to the other Tier II information you are  reporting. Although you may request that location information with  respect to a specific chemical be withheld from the public, you may not  withhold this information from the SERC, the LEPC, or the local fire  department. The Confidential Location Information Sheet is available on  the Agency Web site at http://www.epa.gov/emergencies.</p>
