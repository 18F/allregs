                            <p class="depth0">The Agency encourages applicants to contact their State Office well in advance of the application submission deadline, to ask questions and to discuss applicant and project eligibility potential. At its option, the Agency may establish a preliminary review deadline so that it may informally assess the eligibility of the application and its completeness. The result of the preliminary review is not binding on the Agency. To implement this section, the Agency will issue a notification addressing this issue in accordance with Sec. 4284.915.</p>
