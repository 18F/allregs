At a minimum, this showing must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of how the licensee has complied with the ``substantial service'' requirement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.
