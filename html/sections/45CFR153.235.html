                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allocation of reinsurance contributions. HHS will allocate and disburse to each State operating reinsurance (and will distribute directly to issuers if HHS is operating reinsurance on behalf of a State), reinsurance contributions collected from contributing entities under the national contribution rate for reinsurance payments. The disbursed funds would be based on the total requests for reinsurance payments made under the national reinsurance payment parameters in all States and submitted under Sec. 153.410, net of any adjustment under Sec. 153.230(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excess reinsurance contributions. Any reinsurance contributions collected from contributing entities under the national contribution rate for reinsurance payments for any benefit year but unused for the applicable benefit year will be used for reinsurance payments under the national reinsurance payment parameters for subsequent benefit years.
