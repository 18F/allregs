                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If wing flaps are to be used during takeoff, approach, or landing, at the design flap speeds established for these stages of flight under Sec. 25.335(e) and with the wing flaps in the corresponding positions, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts. The resulting limit loads must correspond to the conditions determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor of 2.0; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Positive and negative gusts of 25 ft/sec EAS acting normal to the flight path in level flight. Gust loads resulting on each part of the structure must be determined by rational analysis. The analysis must take into account the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and rigid body motions of the aircraft. The shape of the gust must be as described in Sec. 25.341(a)(2) except that--
Uds = 25 ft/sec EAS;H = 12.5 c; andc = mean geometric chord of the wing (feet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The airplane must be designed for the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the airplane load factor need not exceed 1.0,

taking into account, as separate conditions, the effects of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Propeller slipstream corresponding to maximum continuous power at the design flap speeds VF, and with takeoff power at not less than 1.4 times the stalling speed for the particular flap position and associated maximum weight; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A head-on gust of 25 feet per second velocity (EAS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If flaps or other high lift devices are to be used in en route conditions, and with flaps in the appropriate position at speeds up to the flap design speed chosen for these conditions, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts within the range determined by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor as prescribed in Sec. 25.337(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vertical gust and turbulence conditions prescribed in Sec. 25.341(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The airplane must be designed for a maneuvering load factor of 1.5 g at the maximum take-off weight with the wing-flaps and similar high lift devices in the landing configurations.
