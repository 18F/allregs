We will make a  preliminary finding that your permit was improvidently issued if, under  the permit eligibility criteria of the applicable regulations  implementing section 510(c) of the Act in effect at the time of permit  issuance, your permit should not have been issued because you or your  operator owned or controlled a surface coal mining and reclamation  operation with an unabated or uncorrected violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will make a finding under paragraph (a) of this section only  if you or your operator--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continue to own or control the operation with the unabated or  uncorrected violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The violation remains unabated or uncorrected; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The violation would cause you to be ineligible under the permit  eligibility criteria in our current regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When we make a preliminary finding under paragraph (a) of this  section, we must serve you with a written notice of the preliminary  finding, which must be based on evidence sufficient to establish a prima  facie case that your permit was improvidently issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 30 days of receiving a notice under paragraph (c) of this  section, you may challenge the preliminary finding by providing us with  evidence as to why the permit was not improvidently issued under the  criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of Sec. Sec. 773.25 through 773.27 of this part  apply when a challenge under paragraph (d) of this section concerns a  preliminary finding under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section that  you or your operator currently own or control, or owned or controlled, a  surface coal mining operation.
