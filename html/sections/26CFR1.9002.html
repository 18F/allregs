                            <p class="depth0">Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the ``Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960''.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 2. Persons to whom this Act applies. This Act shall apply to any person who, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Computed, or was required to compute, taxable income under an accrual method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treated any dealer reserve income, which should have been taken into account (under the accrual method of accounting) for such taxable year, as accruable for a subsequent taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Before September 1, 1960, makes an election under section 3(a) or 4(a) of this Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the year of the change (determined under subsection (b)), the treatment of dealer reserve income by any person to whom this Act applies is changed to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting (whether or not such person initiated the change),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such person makes an election under this subsection, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such person does not make the election provided by section 4(a),
then, for purposes of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the change described in paragraph (1) shall be treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Year of change, etc. In applying section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for

purposes of this section, the ``year of the change'' in the case of any person is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (2), the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The earliest taxable year (whether the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to such year) for which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On or before June 22, 1959:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate issued a notice of deficiency, or a written notice of a proposed deficiency, with respect to dealer reserve income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such person filed with the Secretary or his delegate a claim for refund or credit with respect to dealer reserve income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not, on June 21, 1959, prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.
For purposes of this section, section 481 of such Code shall be treated as applying to any year of the change to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If a person to whom this Act applies makes an election under this subsection, then for purposes of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) a change in the treatment of dealer reserve income to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting shall be treated as not a change in method of accounting in respect of which section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. Any election under this subsection shall apply to all taxable years ending on or before June 22, 1959 (whether the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the corresponding provisions of prior law apply), for which the assessment of any deficiency, or for which refund or credit of any overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not, on June 21, 1959, prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election to pay tax in installments--(1) Eligibility. If the net increase in tax (as defined in paragraph (2)) which results solely from the effect of the election provided by subsection (a) exceeds $2,500, then the taxpayer may elect (at the time the election is made under subsection (a)) to pay in two or more (but not to exceed 10) equal annual installments any portion of such net increase which (on the date of such election) is unpaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility. If the net increase in tax (as defined in paragraph (2)) which results solely from the effect of the election provided by subsection (a) exceeds $2,500, then the taxpayer may elect (at the time the election is made under subsection (a)) to pay in two or more (but not to exceed 10) equal annual installments any portion of such net increase which (on the date of such election) is unpaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net increase in tax defined. For purposes of this section, the term ``net increase in tax'' means the amount (if any) by which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election, exceeds</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election.
For purposes of this paragraph, interest for the period before the date of the election shall be computed as provided in Chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Due date for installments. If an election is made under subsection (b), the first installment shall be paid on or before the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made, and each succeeding installment shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date prescribed by this subsection for payment of the preceding installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of subsequent redetermination of tax--(1) Redetermination. If:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer makes an election under subsection (b), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> There is a redetermination of the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year to which the election provided by subsection (a) applies,
then the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2) shall be redetermined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of increase. If the redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B) results in an increase in the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), the resulting increase shall be prorated to all the installments. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installment. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of decrease. For treatment of a decrease in the net increase in tax as the result of a redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B), see section 6403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to overpayment of installment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Suspension of interest--(1) In general. If an election under subsection (a) applies and there is a net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to such election for the period beginning on the date of such election and ending on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If an election under subsection (a) applies and there is a net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to such election for the period beginning on the date of such election and ending on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No interest during installment period. If an election under subsection (b) applies, no interest shall be imposed for the period on or after the date fixed for payment of the first

installment unless payment of unpaid installments is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest where payment is accelerated. If payment is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g), interest determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 on the entire unpaid tax shall be payable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If payment is accelerated under subsection (f), from the date of notice and demand provided by such subsection to the date such tax is paid, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If payment is accelerated under subsection (g), from the date fixed for paying the unpaid installment to the date such tax is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Termination of installment payment privilege. The extension of time provided by this section for payment of tax shall cease to apply, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a taxpayer who is an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in a trade or business,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a taxpayer who is a partner, the entire interest of such partner is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a taxpayer which is a corporation, the taxpayer ceases to engage in a trade or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments is required to be taken into account by the acquiring corporation under section 5(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Failure to pay installment. If any installment under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time for payment of such installment), the unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Suspension of running of periods of limitation. The running of the periods of limitation provided by section 6502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or corresponding provision of prior law) for the collection of any amount of tax payable in installments under this section shall be suspended for the period of any extension of time for payment granted under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Dealer reserve income. For purposes of this Act, the term ``dealer reserve income'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That part of the consideration derived by any person from the sale or other disposition of customers' sales contracts, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness (or derived from customers' finance charges connected with such sales or other dispositions) which is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Attributable to the sale by such person to such customers, in the ordinary course of his trade or business, of real property or tangible personal property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Held in a reserve account, by the financial institution to which such person disposed of such evidences of indebtedness, for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customers, or both; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That part of the consideration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Derived by any person from a sale described in paragraph (1)(A) in respect of which part or all of the purchase price of the property sold is provided by a financial institution to or for the customer to whom such property is sold, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Derived by such person from finance charges connected with the financing of such sale,
which is held in a reserve account by such financial institution for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customer, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Financial institution. For purposes of this Act, the term ``financial institution'' means any person regularly engaged in the business of acquiring evidences of indebtedness of the kind described in subsection (a)(1), or of financing sales of the kind described in subsection (a)(2), or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other terms; application of other laws. Except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended, terms used in this Act shall have the same meaning as when used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and all provisions of law shall apply with respect to this Act as if this Act were a part of such Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acquiring corporation. In the case of the acquisition of assets of a corporation by another corporation in a distribution or transfer described in section 381(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the acquiring corporation shall, for purposes of this Act, be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Statutes of limitations--(1) Extension of period for assessment and refund or credit.

Sec. 1.9002-1  Purpose, applicability, and definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124) contains transitional provisions relating to adjustments to income resulting from a change in the income tax treatment of dealer reserve income. The purpose of the Act is to provide eligible taxpayers who elect to have its provisions apply with two alternatives for accounting for the adjustments to income resulting from a change to a proper method of reporting dealer reserve income. The Act also provides certain taxpayers with an election to pay in installments any net increase in tax. Eligible taxpayers must make any election under the provisions of the Act prior to September 1, 1960. If any election is made, then the applicable provisions of the Act and Sec. Sec. 1.9002-1 to 1.9002-8, inclusive, shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility to elect. In order to be eligible to make any of the elections provided by the Act, a taxpayer must have, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959, (1) computed, or been required to compute, taxable income under an accrual method of accounting, and (2) treated dealer reserve income (or portions thereof) which should have been taken into account (under the accrual method of accounting) for such most recent taxable year as accruable for a subsequent taxable year. Thus, the elections provided by the Act are not available to a person who, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959, reported dealer reserve income under a method proper under the accrual method of accounting or who was not required to compute taxable income under the accrual method of accounting. An election may be made even though the taxpayer is litigating his liability for income tax based upon his treatment of dealer reserve income, whether in The Tax Court of the United States or any other court, and an election filed by a taxpayer who is litigating his liability for income tax based upon his treatment of dealer reserve income does not constitute a waiver of his right to continue pending litigation until final judicial determination. He must, however, comply with the provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of the Act and Sec. Sec. 1.9002-1 to 1.9002-8, inclusive:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Act. The term the Act means the Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dealer reserve income. The term dealer reserve income means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That part of the consideration derived by any person from the sale or other disposition of customers' sales contracts, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness (or derived from customers' finance charges connected with such sales or other dispositions) which is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Attributable to the sale by such person to such customers, in the ordinary course of his trade or business, of real property or tangible personal property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Held in a reserve account, by the financial institution to which such person disposed of such evidences of indebtedness, for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customers, or both; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That part of the consideration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Derived by any person from a sale described in subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph in respect of which part or all of the purchase price of the property sold is provided by a financial institution to or for the customer to whom such property is sold, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Derived by such person from finance charges connected with the financing of such sale, which is held in a reserve account by such financial institution for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customer, or both. Thus, the term includes amounts held in a reserve account by a financial institution in transactions in which the customer becomes obligated to the institution as well as such

amounts so held by a financial institution in transactions in which the taxpayer is the obligee on the contract, note, or other evidence of indebtedness. For purposes of the definition of the term ``dealer reserve income'' it is immaterial whether or not the taxpayer guarantees the customer's obligation in excess of the reserve retained by the financial institution. The term does not include the consideration derived from transactions relating to the sale of intangible property such as stocks, bonds, copyrights, patents, etc. Further, the term does not include consideration derived by the taxpayer from transactions relating to the sale of property by a person not the taxpayer or to casual sales of property not in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Financial institution. The term financial institution means any person regularly engaged in the business of acquiring evidences of indebtedness of the kind described in section 5(a)(1) of the Act, or of financing sales of the kind described in section 5(a)(2) of the Act, or both. It thus includes banking institutions, finance companies, building and loan associations, and other similar type organizations, as well as an individual or partnership regularly engaged in the described business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Taxpayer. The term taxpayer means any person to whom the Act applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other terms. All other terms which are not specifically defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Code except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended.

Sec. 1.9002-2  Election to have the provisions of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 3(a) of the Act provides that if the income tax treatment of dealer reserve income by the taxpayer is changed (whether or not such change is initiated by the taxpayer) to a proper method under the accrual method of accounting, then the taxpayer may elect to have such change treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer to which the provisions of section 481 of the Code apply. This election may be made only when the alternative election under section 4(a) of the Act has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Year of change. Where an election has been made under section 3(a) of the Act to have section 481 of the Code apply, then for purposes of applying section 481 of the Code the year of change shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 3(b) of the Act. Section 3(b) provides that the year of change is the earlier of (1) the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or (2) the earliest taxable year for which, on or before June 22, 1959,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There was issued a notice of deficiency or written notice of a proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous treatment of dealer reserve income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer filed a claim for refund or credit with respect to the treatment of such income,

and in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment, was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The written notice of proposed deficiency includes a 15- or 30-day letter issued under established procedure or other similar written notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application to pre-1954 Code years. If the earliest year described in paragraph (b) of this section is a year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 in respect of which assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law, section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be treated as applying in the same manner it would have applied had it been enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The operation of this section in determining the year of change may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D, a taxpayer on the calendar year basis who employs the accrual method of accounting, voluntarily changed to the proper method of accounting for dealer reserve income for the taxable year 1959. A statutory notice of deficiency, however, was issued prior to June 23, 1959, relating to the erroneous treatment of such income for the

taxable year 1956, which was the earliest taxable year in respect of which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment was not prevented on June 21, 1959. Prior to September 1, 1960, D properly exercises his election under section 3 of the Act to have the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer to which section 481 of the Code applies. Under these facts, 1956 is the year of the change for purposes of applying section 481. Accordingly, the net amount of any adjustment found necessary as a result of the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income which is attributable to taxable years subject to the 1954 Code shall be taken into account for the year of change in accordance with section 481. The net amount of the adjustments attributable to pre-1954 Code years is to be disregarded. The income of each taxable year succeeding the year of change in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment is not prevented will be recomputed under the proper method of accounting initiated by the change.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except that no notice of a proposed deficiency of any type has been issued, and assume further that no claim for refund has been filed. Since there was no earlier year open on June 21, 1959, for which the taxpayer either was notified of a proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous treatment of dealer reserve income or for which he had filed a claim for refund or credit with respect to the treatment of such income, the year of change is 1959, the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959. Accordingly, the net amount of any adjustment found necessary as a result of the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income which is attributable to taxable years subject to the 1954 Code shall be taken into account for the year of the change in accordance with section 481. The net amount of the adjustments attributable to pre-1954 Code years is to be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except that a refund claim specifying adjustments relative to dealer reserve income was timely filed for the taxable year 1951, which was the earliest taxable year for which a refund or credit of an overpayment or assessment of a deficiency was not prevented on June 21, 1959. Under this factual situation, the year of change for purposes of applying section 481 would be 1951. Section 481 would be applied to 1951 and be given effect for that year in the same manner as it would have applied had it been enacted as a part of the 1939 Code and as if the change to the proper method of accounting had not been initiated by the taxpayer. Any adjustment with regard to dealer reserve income attributable to pre-1951 years is disregarded. The income of each taxable year succeeding the year of change in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment is not prevented will be recomputed under the proper method of accounting initiated by the change.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8371, Sept. 1, 1960]


Sec. 1.9002-3  Election to have the provisions of section 481 of theInternal Revenue Code of 1954 not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4(a) of the Act provides that in the treatment of dealer reserve income by the taxpayer is changed to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting, then the taxpayer may elect to have such change treated as not a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply. This election shall apply to all taxable years ending on or before June 22, 1959, for which the assessment of any deficiency, or for which refund or credit of any overpayment, was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law. This election may be made only if the alternative election under section 3(a) of the Act has not been exercised. If an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act, taxable income (or net income in the case of a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies) shall be recomputed under a proper method of accounting for dealer reserve income for each taxable year to which the election applies, without regard to section 481.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8372, Sept. 1, 1960]


Sec. 1.9002-4  Election to pay net increase in tax in installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election. If an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act and if the net increase in tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section exceeds $2,500, the taxpayer may also make an election under section 4(b) of the Act prior to September 1, 1960, to pay any portion of such net increase in tax, unpaid on the date of the election, in 2 or more, but not to exceed 10, equal annual installments. If the taxpayer making the election under section 4(a) of the Act is a partnership or a small business corporation electing under Subchapter S, Chapter 1

of the Code, the determination as to whether the net increase in tax exceeds $2,500 shall be made separately as to each partner or shareholder, respectively, with regard to his individual liability. Thus, if a partnership makes an election under section 4(a) of the Act, and partners A and B had a net increase in tax of $3,000 and $2,000, respectively, as a result of dealer reserve income adjustments to partnership income, partner A may elect under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in 2 or more, but not exceeding 10, equal annual installments to the extent that such tax was unpaid on the date of the election. Partner B may not make the election since his net increase in tax does not exceed $2,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Net increase in tax. (1) The term ``net increase in tax'' means the amount by which the sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under section 4(a) of the Act applies and which is attributable to the election exceeds the sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under such section applies and which is attributable to the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``net increase in tax'' means the amount by which the sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under section 4(a) of the Act applies and which is attributable to the election exceeds the sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under such section applies and which is attributable to the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In determining the net increase in tax, the tax and interest for each taxable year to which the election applies is computed by taking into account all adjustments necessary to reflect the change to the proper treatment of dealer reserve income. If the computation results in additional tax for a taxable year, then interest is computed under section 6601 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) on such additional tax for the taxable year involved from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for such taxable year to the date the election is made. The interest so computed is then added to the additional tax determined for such taxable year. The sum of these two items (tax plus interest) represents the increase in tax for such taxable year. If the computation of the tax after taking into account the appropriate dealer reserve income adjustments results in a reduction in tax for any taxable year to which the election applies, interest under section 6611 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) is computed from the date of the overpayment of the tax for such year to the date of the election. The amount of the interest so computed is then added to the reduction in tax to determine the total decrease in tax for such year. The net increase in tax is then determined by adding together the total increases in tax for each year to which the election applies and from the resulting total subtracting the sum of the total decreases in tax for each year. If the total increases in tax for all such years do not exceed the total decreases in tax, there is no net increase in tax for purposes of section 4(b) of the Act. For purposes of determining the net increase in tax, net operating losses affecting the computation of tax for any prior taxable year not otherwise affected shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time for paying installments. If the election under this section is made to pay the unpaid portion of the net increase in tax in installments, the first installment shall be paid on or before the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Code for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which such election is made. Each succeeding installment shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date prescribed for the payment of the preceding installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Termination of installment privilege--(1) For nonpayment of installment. The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director if any installment under such section is not paid by the taxpayer on or before the date fixed for its payment, including any extension of time for payment of any such installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For nonpayment of installment. The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director if any installment under such section is not paid by the taxpayer on or before the date fixed for its payment, including any extension of time for payment of any such installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For other reasons. The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in any trade or business,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a partner, his entire interest in the partnership is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a corporation, it ceases to engage in a trade or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments is required to be taken into account by an acquiring corporation under section 5(d) of the Act.

The installment privilege is not terminated under this subparagraph even though the taxpayer terminates the trade or business in respect of which the dealer reserve income is attributable provided the taxpayer continues in a trade or business. Further, the privilege is not terminated by a transfer of a part of a partnership interest so long as the partner retains any interest in the partnership. Also, the privilege is not terminated by a transaction falling within the provisions of section 381(a) of the Code if, under section 5(d) of the Act, the acquiring corporation is required to take into account the unpaid portion of the net increase in tax. In such a case the privilege may be continued by the acquiring corporation in the same manner and under the same conditions as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Redetermination of tax subsequent to exercise of installment election. Section 4(d) of the Act provides that where a taxpayer has elected to pay the net increase in tax in installments and thereafter it becomes necessary to redetermine the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year to which the election provided by section 4(a) of the Act applies, then the net increase in tax shall be redetermined. Where the redetermination does not involve adjustments affecting the treatment of dealer reserve income, then the net increase in tax previously computed will not be disturbed. The net increase in tax is limited to the amount of tax computed under section 4(b)(2) of the Act as a result of the change in treatment accorded dealer reserve income. If the redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election applies results in an addition to the net increase in tax previously computed, then such addition shall be prorated to all of the installments whether paid or unpaid. The part of the addition, prorated to installments which are not yet due, shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installments. The part of the addition prorated to installments, the time for payment of which has arrived, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director. Under section 4(g) of the Act, failure to make such payment within 10 days after issuance of notice and demand will terminate the installment privilege. The imposition of interest on the addition to the net increase in tax as a result of the redetermination will be determined in the same manner as interest on the previously computed net increase in tax. Thus, no interest will be imposed on the amount of the addition to the net increase in tax prorated to installments not yet due unless the installment privilege is terminated under subsection (f) or (g) of section 4 of the Act. If a reduction in the net increase in tax results from a redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election applies, the entire amount of such reduction shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 6403 of the Code (relating to overpayment of installments), be prorated to the installments which are not yet due, resulting in a pro rata reduction in each of such installments. Where the redetermination does not involve adjustments pertaining to dealer reserve income, then any resulting deficiency pertaining to the year to which the election applies will be assessed and collected, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) without regard to any election made under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Periods of limitation. Section 4(h) of the Act provides that where there is an extension of time for payment of tax under the provisions of section 4(b) of the Act, the running of the periods of limitation provided by section 6502 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) for collection of such tax is suspended for the period of time for which the extension is granted.

Sec. 1.9002-5  Special rules relating to interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Where an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act interest is computed under section 6601 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) on any increase in tax attributable to such election for each taxable year involved for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for such year (determined without regard to any extensions of time for filing the return) through the date preceding the date on which the election is made. Where the election under section 4(a) of the Act results in a decrease in tax for any year to which the election applies, interest is computed in accordance with section 6611 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) from the date of overpayment through the date preceding the date on which the election is made. Where there is a net increase in tax as a result of the election under section 4(a) of the Act, no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to the dealer reserve income adjustment for any year to which the election applies for the period commencing with the date such election is made and ending on the date prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to extensions of time) for the taxable year in which the election is made. This rule applies regardless of whether the election under section 4(b) of the Act is made. If there is no net increase in tax, interest on any underpayment or overpayment attributable to the dealer reserve income adjustment for any taxable year to which the election applies for the period commencing with the date of the election shall be determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.6601-1 and 301.6611-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Installment period--(1) Where payment is not accelerated. If the election under section 4(b) of the Act is made to pay the net increase in tax in installments, no interest will be imposed on such net increase in tax for the period beginning with the due date fixed under section 4(c) of the Act for the first installment payment and ending with the date fixed under such section for the last installment payment unless payment of the unpaid installments is accelerated under other provisions of the Act. See subsections (f) and (g) of section 4 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where payment is not accelerated. If the election under section 4(b) of the Act is made to pay the net increase in tax in installments, no interest will be imposed on such net increase in tax for the period beginning with the due date fixed under section 4(c) of the Act for the first installment payment and ending with the date fixed under such section for the last installment payment unless payment of the unpaid installments is accelerated under other provisions of the Act. See subsections (f) and (g) of section 4 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where payment is accelerated. Where payment of the unpaid installments is accelerated because of the termination of the installment privilege, interest will be computed under section 6601 of the Code on the entire unpaid net increase in tax for the applicable period set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of acceleration under section 4(f) of the Act for reasons other than nonpayment of an installment, from the date of the notice and demand for payment of the unpaid tax to the date of payment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of acceleration under section 4(g) of the Act for nonpayment of an installment, from the date fixed for payment of the installment to the date of payment.

When payment is accelerated under section 4(f) of the Act, however, no interest will be charged where payment of the unpaid installments is made within 10 days of issuance of the notice and demand for such payment.

Sec. 1.9002-7  Statute of limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Extension of period for assessment and refund or credit. Under section 5(e) of the Act, if an election is made to have the Act apply, and if the assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment attributable to the election, for any taxable year to which the Act applies was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, relating to closing agreements

and compromises), but would be so prevented prior to September 1, 1961, the period within which such assessment, or such refund or credit, may be made with respect to such taxable year shall not expire prior to September 1, 1961. An election under either section 3 or 4 of the Act will be considered to be a consent to the extension of the period of limitation for purposes of assessment for any year to which the Act applies. Thus, for example, if, as the result of an election under section 4(a) of the Act, assessment of a deficiency for the taxable year 1955 was not prevented by the statute of limitations, a judicial decision that had become final, or otherwise, on June 21, 1959, but would (except for section 5(e) of the Act) be prevented on a later date, as for instance September 1, 1959, then for purposes of applying section 4 of the Act, assessment may be made at any time prior to September 1, 1961, with respect to such year if the taxpayer made an election under the Act prior to September 1, 1960. Section 5(e) of the Act will, in no event, operate to shorten the period of limitation otherwise applicable with respect to any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Years closed by closing agreement or compromise. For purposes of the Act, if the assessment of any deficiency or a refund or credit of any overpayment for any taxable year was not prevented on June 21, 1959, but is prevented on the date of an election under section 3 or 4 of the Act by the operation of the provisions of chapter 74 of the Code (relating to closing agreements and compromises), assessment, refund, or credit will, nevertheless, be considered as being prevented on June 21, 1959.
