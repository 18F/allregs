                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a result of the Assistant Secretary's determination granting final approval to the Alaska plan under section 18(e) of the Act, effective September 26, 1984, occupational safety and health standards which have been promulgated under section 6 of the Act do not apply with respect to issues covered under the Alaska plan. This determination also relinquishes concurrent Federal OSHA authority to issue citations for violation of such standards under sections 5(a)(2) and 9 of the Act; to conduct inspections and investigations under section 8 (except those necessary to conduct evaluation of the plan under section 18(b) and other inspections, investigations, or proceedings necessary to carry out Federal responsibilities not specifically preempted by section 18(e)); to conduct enforcement proceedings in contested cases under section 10; to institute proceedings to correct imminent dangers under section 13; and to propose civil penalties or inititate criminal proceedings for violations of the Federal Act under section 17. The Assistant Secretary may retain jurisdiction under the above provisions in any proceeding commenced under section 9 or 10 before the effective date of the 18(e) determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In accordance with section 18(e), final approval relinquishes Federal OSHA authority only with regard to occupational safety and health issues

covered by the Alaska plan. OSHA retains full authority over issues which are not subject to State enforcement under the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal OSHA retains its authority relative to safety and health in private sector maritime activities and will continue to enforce all provisions of the Act, rules or orders, and all Federal standards, current or future, specifically directed to maritime employment (29 CFR Part 1915, shipyard employment; Part 1917, marine terminals; Part 1918, longshoring; Part 1919, gear certification) as well as provisions of general industry and construction standards (29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926) appropriate to hazards found in these employments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal jurisdiction will be retained over marine-related private sector employment at worksites on the navigable waters, such as floating seafood processing plants, marine construction, employments on artificial islands, and diving operations in accordance with section 4(b)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Federal jurisdiction is also retained and exercised by the Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor (Secretary's Order 5-96, December 27, 1996) with respect to the field sanitation standard, 29 CFR 1928.110, and the enforcement of the temporary labor camps standard, 29 CFR 1910.142, in agriculture, as described in Sec. 1952.243(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Federal jurisdiction is also retained for Native health care facilities that are Federally owned and contractor operated, including those owned by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Health Service; the U.S. Department of Defense; or the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and operated by Tribal organizations under contract with the Indian Health Service. However, the State retains jurisdiction over construction and contract maintenance activities at these facilities with the exception of the Metlakatla Indian Community, Annette Island Service Unit, which is entirely under Federal jurisdiction. (The State also retains jurisdiction over Native health care facilities that are leased or owned by Tribal organizations, except for the Metlakatla Indian Community.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Federal jurisdiction is also retained with regard to the operations of private contractors at Cape Lisburne Long Range Missile Base, Point Lay Short Range Missile Base, Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island, Fort Greeley Missile Defense in Delta Junction, the U.S. Coast Guard Integrated Support Commands in Kodiak and Ketchikan, the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, and the U.S. Coast Guard 17th District Command in Juneau.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Federal jurisdiction is also retained for private sector worksites located within the Annette Islands Reserve of the Metlakatla Indian Community, for private sector worksites located within the Denali (Mount McKinley) National Park, for Federal government employers, and for the U.S. Portal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal authority under provisions of the Act not listed in section 18(e) is unaffected by final approval of the plan. Thus, for example, the Assistant Secretary retains his authority under section 11(c) of the Act with regard to complaints alleging discrimination against employees because of the exercise of any right afforded to the employee by the Act, although such complaints may be referred to the State for investigation. The Assistant Secretary also retains his authority under section 6 of the Act to promulgate, modify or revoke occupational safety and health standards which address the working conditions of all employees, including those in States which have received an affirmative 18(e) determination, although such standards may not be Federally applied. In the event that the State's 18(e) status is subsequently withdrawn and Federal authority reinstated, all Federal standards, including any standards promulgated or modified during the 18(e) period, would be Federally enforceable in that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As required by section 18(f) of the Act, OSHA will continue to monitor the operations of the Alaska State program to assure that the provisions of

the State plan are substantially complied with and that the program remains at least as effective as the Federal program. Failure by the State to comply with its obligations may result in the revocation of the final determination under section 18(e), resumption of Federal enforcement, and/or proceedings for withdrawal of plan approval.
