Such funds may be carried over for a maximum period of  two years beyond the initial grant funding period and must be utilized  only for the intent, purpose and scope of the original grant. These  carry-over grant funds shall not be reprogrammed into other  appropriation activities or subactivities. Funds carried over into  another fiscal year will be added to the grantee's new fiscal year  funding amount.</p>
