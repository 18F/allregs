                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives are allowed to satisfy the testing requirements in Sec. Sec. 79.52, 79.53, and 79.54 and the associated reporting requirements in Sec. 79.59 on an individual or group basis, provided that such products meet the criteria in this section for enrollment in the same fuel/additive group. However, each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive must individually comply with the notification requirements of Sec. 79.59(b). Further, if a manufacturer elects to comply by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be individually subject to the information requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The use of the grouping provision to comply with Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing requirements is voluntary. No manufacturer is prohibited from testing and submitting its own data for its own product registration, despite its qualification for membership in a particular group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The only groups permitted are those established in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each manufacturer who chooses to enroll a fuel or fuel additive in a group of similar fuels and fuel additives as designated in this section may satisfy the registration requirements through a group submission of jointly-sponsored testing and analysis conducted on a product which is representative of all products in that group, provided that the group representative is chosen according to the specifications in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The health effects information submitted by a group shall be considered applicable to all fuels and fuel additives in the group. A fuel or fuel additive manufacturer who has chosen to participate in a group may subsequently choose to perform testing of such fuel or fuel additive on an individual basis; however, until such independent registration information has

been received and reviewed by EPA, the information initially submitted by the group on behalf of the manufacturer's fuel or fuel additive shall be considered applicable and valid for that fuel or fuel additive. It could therefore be used to support requirements for further testing under the provisions of Tier 3 or to support regulatory decisions affecting that fuel or fuel additive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers are responsible for determining the appropriate groups for their products according to the criteria in this section and for enrolling their products into those groups under industry-sponsored or other independent brokering arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers who enroll a fuel or fuel additive into a group shall share the applicable costs according to appropriate arrangements established by the group. The organization and administration of group functions and the development of cost-sharing arrangements are the responsibility of the participating manufacturers. If manufacturers are unable to agree on fair and equitable cost sharing arrangements and if such dispute is referred by one or more manufacturers to EPA for resolution, then the provisions in Sec. 79.56(c) (1) and (2) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In complying with the registration requirements for a given fuel or fuel additive, notwithstanding the enrollment of such fuel or additive in a group, a manufacturer may make use of available information for any product which conforms to the same grouping criteria as the given product. If, for this purpose, a manufacturer wishes to rely upon the information previously submitted by another manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) for registration of a similar product (or group of products), then the previous submitter is entitled to reimbursement by the manufacturer for an appropriate portion of the applicable costs incurred to obtain and report such information. Such entitlement shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen years following the date on which the original information was submitted. Pursuant to Sec. 79.59(b)(4)(ii), the manufacturer who relies on previously-submitted registration data shall certify to EPA that the original submitter has been notified and that appropriate reimbursement arrangements have been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When private efforts have failed to resolve a dispute about a fair amount or method of cost-sharing or reimbursement for testing costs incurred under this subpart, then any party involved in that dispute may initiate a hearing by filing two signed copies of a request for a hearing with a regional office of the American Arbitration Association and mailing a copy of the request to EPA. A copy must also be sent to each person from whom the filing party seeks reimbursement or who seeks reimbursement from that party. The information and fees to be included in the request for hearing are specified in 40 CFR 791.20(b) and (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional procedures and requirements governing the hearing process are those specified in 40 CFR 791.22 through 791.50, 791.60, 791.85, and 791.105, excluding 40 CFR 791.39(a)(3) and 791.48(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Basis for classification. (1) Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to fuels and fuel additives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to fuels and fuel additives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuels shall be classified pursuant to Sec. 79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of such fuels in their uncombusted state. The classification of a fuel product must take into account the components of all bulk fuel additives which are listed in the registration application or basic registration data submitted for the fuel product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fuel additives shall be classified pursuant to Sec. 79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of the respective uncombusted additive/base fuel mixture pursuant to Sec. 79.51(h)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In determining the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts shall be ignored unless otherwise noted. Impurities are those substances which are present through contamination or which remain in the fuel

or additive naturally after processing is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reference standards.

A separate non-baseline gasoline group is defined for each such oxygenating compound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each unique methanol and co-solvent combination (whether one, two, or more additional oxygenate compounds) used in a non-baseline fuel shall also define a separate group. An oxygenate compound used as a co-solvent for methanol in a non-baseline gasoline formulation must be identified as such in its registration. If the oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, then the compound shall be regarded by EPA as defining a separate non-baseline gasoline group. Examples of methanol/co-solvent combinations occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include methanol/isopropyl alcohol, methanol/butanol, and methanol with alcohols up to C8/octanol (Octamix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be a formulation consisting of the gasoline base fuel blended with the relevant oxygenate compound (or methanol/co-solvent combination) in an amount equivalent to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the oxygenate (or methanol/co-solvent combination) recorded in the basic registration data of any member fuel or additive product. In the event that two or more products in the same group contain the same and highest amount of the oxygenate or methanol/co-solvent blend, then the representative shall be chosen at random for such candidate products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent combination to be blended with the gasoline base fuel for testing purposes shall be chemical-grade quality, at a minimum, and shall not contain a significant amount of other contaminating oxygenate compounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separate non-baseline gasoline groups shall also be defined for gasoline formulations derived from each particular petroleum source not listed in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such groups may include, but are not limited to, those derived from shale, used oil, waste plastics, and other recycled chemical/petrochemical products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 79.51(i), non-baseline gasoline products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-Baseline Diesel. The Non-Baseline diesel fuels and associated additives shall sort into groups according to the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For diesel fuel and additive products which contain 1.0 percent or more oxygen by weight in the form of alcohol(s) and/or ether(s):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A separate non-baseline diesel group shall be defined by each individual alcohol or ether listed as a component in the registration application or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the relevant alcohol or ether in an amount equivalent to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the alcohol or ether recorded in the basic registration data of any member fuel or additive product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A separate non-baseline diesel group is also defined for each of the following classes of oxygenating compounds: mixed nitroso-compounds; mixed nitro-compounds; mixed alkyl nitrates; mixed alkyl nitrites; peroxides; furans; mixed alkyl esters of plant and/or animal origin (biodiesel). For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be formulated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From the class of compounds which defines the group, a particular oxygenate compound shall be chosen from among all such compounds recorded in the registration application

or basic registration data of any fuel or additive in the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The selected compound shall be the one recorded in any member product's registration application with the highest actual or recommended maximum concentration-in-use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event that two or more oxygenate compounds in the relevant class have the highest recorded concentration-in-use, then the oxygenate compound to be used in the group representative shall be chosen at random from the qualifying candidate compounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The compound thus selected shall be the group representative, and shall be used in testing at the following concentration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For biodiesel groups, the representative shall be 100 percent biodiesel fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Otherwise, the group representative shall be the selected compound mixed into diesel base fuel at the maximum recommended concentration-in-use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separate non-baseline diesel groups shall also be defined for diesel formulations derived from each particular petroleum source not listed in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such groups may include, but are not limited to, those derived from shale, used oil, waste plastics, and other recycled chemical/petrochemical products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In any such group, the first product to be registered or to apply for EPA registration shall be the representative of that group. If two or more products are registered or apply for first registration simultaneously, then the representative shall be chosen by a random method from among such candidate products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 79.51(i), non-baseline diesel products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Non-baseline methanol. The Non-Baseline methanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s) of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall define a separate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The representative of each such non-baseline methanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by volume of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s), the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Non-Baseline Ethanol. The Non-Baseline ethanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s) of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall define a separate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The representative of each such non-baseline ethanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by volume of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s), the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Non-Baseline Methane. The Non-Baseline methane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of non-methane hydrocarbons. If two or more member products have the same and the highest concentration-in-use, then the representative shall be chosen at random from such products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Non-baseline propane. The Non-Baseline propane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of butane and higher hydrocarbons. If two or more products have the same and the highest concentration-in-use, then the representative shall be chosen at random from such products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Atypical groups. (A) As defined for each individual fuel family in Sec. 79.56(e)(3), fuels and additives meeting any one of the following criteria are considered atypical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more elements in

addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Diesel Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Methanol Atypical fuels and additives contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> chlorine in excess of 0.0001 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ethanol Atypical fuels and additives contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and copper, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> contain chlorine (as chloride) in excess of 0.0004 percent by weight, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> contain copper in excess of 0.07 mg/L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Methane Atypical fuels and additives contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> sulfur in excess of 16 ppm by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Propane Atypical fuels and additives contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> sulfur in excess of 123 ppm by weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> General rules for sorting these atypical fuels and additives into separate groups are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 79.51(j), a given atypical product may belong to more than one atypical group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuels and additives in different fuel families may not be grouped together, even if they contain the same atypical element(s) or other atypical characteristic(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A fuel or additive containing one or more atypical elements attached to a polymer compound must be sorted into a separate group from atypical fuels or fuel additives containing the same atypical element(s) in non-polymer form. However, the occurrence of a polymer compound which does not contain an atypical element does not affect the grouping of a fuel or additive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Specific rules for sorting each family's atypical fuels and additives into separate groups, and for choosing each such group's representative for testing, are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A separate group is created for each atypical element (or other atypical characteristic) occurring separately, i.e., in the absence of any other atypical element or characteristic, in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given fuel family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in Sec. 79.56(d), a fuel product which is classified as atypical because its basic registration data or application lists a bulk additive containing an atypical characteristic, may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and additives containing the same atypical characteristic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within a group of products containing only one atypical element or characteristic, the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture with the highest concentration-in-use or recommended concentration-in-use of the atypical element or characteristic shall be the designated representative of that group. In the event that two or more fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures within the group contain the same and highest concentration of the single atypical element or characteristic, then the group representative shall be selected by a random method from among such candidate products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A separate group is also created for each unique combination of atypical elements (and/or other specified atypical characteristics) occurring together in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given fuel family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in Sec. 79.56(d), a fuel which is classified as atypical because its basic registration data lists one bulk additive containing two or more atypical characteristics, may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and/or additives containing

the same combination of atypical characteristics. Grouping of fuels containing more than one atypical additive shall be guided by provisions of Sec. 79.51(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical elements or characteristics, the designated representative shall be the product within the group which contains the highest total concentration of the atypical elements or characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event that two or more products within a given atypical group contain the same and highest concentration of the same atypical elements or characteristics then, among such candidate products, the designated representative shall be the product which, first, has the highest total concentration of metals, followed in order by highest total concentration of halogens, highest total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur concentration, as applicable), highest total concentration of polymers containing atypical elements, and, lastly, highest total concentration of oxygen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If two or more products have the same and highest concentration of the variable identified in the preceding paragraph, then, among such products, the one with the greatest concentration of the next highest variable on the list shall be the group representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> This decision-making process shall continue until a single product is determined to be the representative. If two or more products remain tied at the end of this process, then the representative shall be chosen by a random method from among such remaining products.
