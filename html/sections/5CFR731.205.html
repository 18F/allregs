An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agency, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency is responsible for enforcing the period of debarment and taking appropriate action if a person applies for, or is inappropriately appointed to, a position at that agency during the debarment period. This responsibility does not limit OPM's authority to exercise jurisdiction itself and take any action OPM deems appropriate.</p>
