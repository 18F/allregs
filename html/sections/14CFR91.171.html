                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person may operate a civil aircraft under IFR using the VOR system of radio navigation unless the VOR equipment of that aircraft--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is maintained, checked, and inspected under an approved procedure; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has been operationally checked within the preceding 30 days, and was found to be within the limits of the permissible indicated bearing error set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each person conducting a VOR check under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use, at the airport of intended departure, an FAA-operated or approved test signal or a test signal radiated by a certificated and appropriately rated radio repair station or, outside the United States, a test signal operated or approved by an appropriate authority to check the VOR equipment (the maximum permissible indicated bearing error is plus or minus 4 degrees); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use, at the airport of intended departure, a point on the airport surface designated as a VOR system checkpoint by the Administrator, or, outside the United States, by an appropriate authority (the maximum permissible bearing error is plus or minus 4 degrees);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If neither a test signal nor a designated checkpoint on the surface is available, use an airborne checkpoint designated by the Administrator or, outside the United States, by an appropriate authority (the maximum permissible bearing error is plus or minus 6 degrees); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If no check signal or point is available, while in flight--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Select a VOR radial that lies along the centerline of an established VOR airway;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Select a prominent ground point along the selected radial preferably more than 20 nautical miles from the VOR ground facility and maneuver the aircraft directly over the point at a reasonably low altitude; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Note the VOR bearing indicated by the receiver when over the ground point (the maximum permissible variation between the published radial and the indicated bearing is 6 degrees).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If dual system VOR (units independent of each other except for the antenna) is installed in the aircraft, the person checking the equipment may check one system against the other in place of the check procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Both systems shall be tuned to the same VOR ground facility and note the indicated bearings to that station. The maximum permissible variation between the two indicated bearings is 4 degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each person making the VOR operational check, as specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, shall enter the date, place, bearing error, and sign the aircraft log or other record. In addition, if a test signal radiated by a repair station, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is used, an entry must be made in the aircraft log or other record by the repair station certificate holder or the certificate holder's representative certifying to the bearing transmitted by the repair station for the check and the date of transmission.
