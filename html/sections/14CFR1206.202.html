                            <p class="depth0">Publication in the Federal Register is a means of making certain Agency records are available to the public in accordance with 5 U.S.C.552(a)(2) without requiring the filing of a FOIA request. NASA has a FOIA Electronic Library Web site at NASA Headquarters and each of its Centers. The FedBizOpps (FBO) (formerly Commerce Business Daily), is also a source of information concerning Agency records or actions. Various other NASA publications and documents, and indexes thereto, are available from other sources, such as the U.S. Superintendent of Documents and the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (Department of the Interior). Such publications and documents are not required to be made available or reproduced in response to a request unless they cannot be purchased readily from available sources.</p>
