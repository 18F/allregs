                            <p class="depth0">Yes. There are four limitations concerning job search and job readiness assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance counts for a maximum of six weeks in the preceding 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the State's total unemployment rate is at least 50 percent greater than the United States' total unemployment rate or if the State meets the definition of a ``needy State'', specified at Sec. 260.30 of this chapter, then an individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance counts for a maximum of 12 weeks in that 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a week equals 20 hours for a work-eligible individual who is a single custodial parent with a child under six years of age and equals 30 hours for all other work-eligible individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance does not count for a week that immediately follows four consecutive weeks in which the State reports any hours of such participation in the preceding 12-month period. For purposes of this paragraph a week means seven consecutive days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Not more than once for any individual in the preceding 12-month period, a State may count three or four days of job search and job readiness assistance during a week as a full week of participation. We calculate a full week of participation based on the average daily hours of participation for three or four days and will prorate participation at that level for the remaining one or two days to determine the total hours for a five-day week. Any prorated hours of participation must be included in the calculation of total hours permitted under the limitation in this section.
