                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em> requires each manufacturer, importer, or private labeler  of a product which is subject to a consumer product safety standard to  issue a certificate of compliance with the applicable standard and to  base that certificate upon a test of each item or upon a reasonable  testing program. Because it is not practical to test each item subject  to the standard, a reasonable testing program shall be used to support  certificates of compliance for cellulose insulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements of testing program. A reasonable testing program  for cellulose insulation is one which demonstrates with reasonable  certainty that insulation certified to comply with the standard will  meet all requirements of the standard. Manufacturers, private labelers,  and importers shall determine the types and frequency of testing for  their own reasonable testing programs. A reasonable testing program may  include either the tests prescribed by the standard, or any other  reasonable test procedures. However, a reasonable testing program cannot  consist of tests which the party issuing the certificate of compliance  knows (or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should know) will  pass or accept insulation which will yield failing results when  subjected to any of the tests in the standard. All reasonable testing  programs shall consist of four elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualification tests which must be performed on samples of the  manufacturer's cellulose insulation to demonstrate that the product is  capable of passing the tests prescribed by the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the cellulose insulation which passed the  qualification testing. This description is known as the ``product  specification.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Production tests, which must be performed at appropriate  production intervals as long as the cellulose insulation is being  manufactured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Corrective action, which must be taken whenever samples of the  cellulose insulation yield unacceptable or failing test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commission testing. The Commission will test for compliance with  the standard by using the test procedures contained in the standard, and  will base enforcement actions for violation of the standard on the  results of such testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Testing by third parties. At the option of the manufacturer,  importer, or private labeler, some or all of the testing for the  reasonable testing program may be performed by a commercial testing  laboratory. However, the manufacturer, importer, or private labeler is  responsible for ensuring that all testing used to support the  certificate of compliance has been properly performed with passing or  acceptable results and for maintaining all records of   such tests in accordance with Sec. 1209.38 below.</p>
