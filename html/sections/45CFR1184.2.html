                                Sec. 1184.2  What are IMLS's general policies with respect to FOIA?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, IMLS records subject to the  FOIA are available to any person who requests them in accordance with  these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records available at the IMLS FOIA Electronic Reading Room. IMLS  makes records available on its Web site in accordance with 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(2), as amended, and other documents that, because of the nature  of their subject matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests.  IMLS establishes categories of records that can be disclosed regularly  and proactively identifies and discloses additional records of interest  to the public. To save time and money, IMLS strongly urges you to review  documents available at the IMLS FOIA Electronic Reading Room before  submitting a FOIA request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this part, all of the terms defined  in the Freedom of Information Act, and the OMB Guidelines apply, unless  otherwise defined in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use request. A request by or on behalf of anyone who  seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her  commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering  those interests through litigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct costs. Those expenses that IMLS actually incurs in  searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use  requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request.  Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing  the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16.1 percent of  that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication  machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as  the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the  records are kept.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication. The making of a copy of a record, or of the  information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request.  Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic  records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Educational institution. Any school that operates a program of  scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the  request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a  qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a  commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fee waiver. The waiver or reduction of processing fees if a  requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied  including that the information is in the public interest and is not  requested for a commercial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> FOIA Public Liaison. An IMLS official who is responsible for  assisting in   reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status  of FOIA requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Non-commercial scientific institution. An institution that is  not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of  conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to  promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category  must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the  auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to  further scientific research and not for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Representative of news media. Any person or entity organized and  operated to publish or broadcast news to the public that actively  gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public,  uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work,  and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means  information that is about current events or that would be of current  interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include  television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large  and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their  products available through a variety of means to the general public. A  request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the  requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use.  ``Freelance'' journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting  publication through a news media entity will be considered as working  for that entity. A publishing contract would provide the clearest  evidence that publication is expected; however, IMLS will also consider  a requester's past publication record in making this determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Requester Category. One of the three categories that IMLS places  requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be  charged fees for search, review and duplication, and include commercial  requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or  news media requesters, and all other requesters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Review. The examination of a record located in response to a  request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from  disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure,  such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for  disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking  the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a  record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent  both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made  by a confidential business information submitter under Sec. 1184.8 but  it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues  regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Search. The process of looking for and retrieving records or  information responsive to a FOIA request. Search time includes page-by- page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and  the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from  electronic records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Working day. A regular Federal working day. It does not include  Saturdays, Sundays, or legal Federal holidays.</p>
