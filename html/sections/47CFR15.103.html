                            <p class="depth0">The following devices are subject only to the general conditions of  operation in Secs. 15.5 and 15.29 and are exempt from the specific  technical standards and other requirements contained in this part. The  operator of the exempted device shall be required to stop operating the  device upon a finding by the Commission or its representative that the  device is causing harmful interference. Operation shall not resume until  the condition causing the harmful interference has been corrected.  Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that the manufacturer  of an exempted device endeavor to have the device meet the specific  technical standards in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A digital device utilized exclusively in any transportation  vehicle including motor vehicles and aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A digital device used exclusively as an electronic control or  power system utilized by a public utility or in an industrial plant. The  term public utility includes equipment only to the extent that it is in  a dedicated building or large room owned or leased by the utility and  does not extend to equipment installed in a subscriber's facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A digital device used exclusively as industrial, commercial, or  medical test equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A digital device utilized exclusively in an appliance, e.g.,  microwave oven, dishwasher, clothes dryer, air conditioner (central or  window), etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Specialized medical digital devices (generally used at the  direction of or under the supervision of a licensed health care  practitioner) whether used in a patient's home or a health care  facility. Non-specialized medical devices, i.e., devices marketed  through retail channels for use by the general public, are not exempted.  This exemption also does not apply to digital devices used for record  keeping or any purpose not directly connected with medical treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Digital devices that have a power consumption not exceeding 6  nW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Joystick controllers or similar devices, such as a mouse, used  with digital devices but which contain only non-digital circuitry or a  simple circuit to convert the signal to the format required (e.g., an  integrated circuit for   analog to digital conversion) are viewed as passive add-on devices, not  themselves directly subject to the technical standards or the equipment  authorization requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Digital devices in which both the highest frequency generated  and the highest frequency used are less than 1.705 MHz and which do not  operate from the AC power lines or contain provisions for operation  while connected to the AC power lines. Digital devices that include, or  make provision for the use of, battery eliminators, AC adaptors or  battery chargers which permit operation while charging or that connect  to the AC power lines indirectly, obtaining their power through another  device which is connected to the AC power lines, do not fall under this  exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Responsible parties should note that equipment containing more  than one device is not exempt from the technical standards in this part  unless all of the devices in the equipment meet the criteria for  exemption. If only one of the included devices qualifies for exemption,  the remainder of the equipment must comply with any applicable  regulations. If a device performs more than one function and all of  those functions do not meet the criteria for exemption, the device does  not qualify for inclusion under the exemptions.</p>
