L. 111-84), which authorizes DoD to implement a Pilot Program for the Temporary Exchange of Information Technology (IT) Personnel. This statute authorizes the temporary assignment of DoD IT employees to private sector organizations. This statute also gives DoD the authority to accept private sector IT employees assigned under the Pilot. This program is referred to as the Information Technology Exchange Program (ITEP) pilot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DoD Component authorized approving official may approve assignments as a mechanism for improving the DoD workforce's competency in using IT to deliver government information and services. DoD Component authorized approving official may not make assignments under this part to circumvent personnel ceilings, or as a substitute for other more appropriate personnel decisions or actions. Approved assignments must meet the strategic program goals of the DoD Components. The benefits to the DoD

Components and the private sector organizations are the primary considerations in initiating assignments; not the desires or personal needs of an individual employee.</p>
