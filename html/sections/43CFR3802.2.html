                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any operator who conducts mining operations under an approved  plan of operations shall, if required to do so by the authorized  officer, furnish a bond in an amount determined by the authorized  officer. The authorized officer may determine not to require a bond  where mining operations would cause nominal environmental damage, or the  operator has an excellent past record for reclamation. In determining  the amount of the bond, the authorized officer shall consider the  estimated cost of stabilizing and reclaiming all areas disturbed by the  operations consistent with Sec. 3802.3-2(h) of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit and maintain in a  Federal depository account of the United States Treasury, as directed by  the authorized officer, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar  amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having  a face and market value at the time of deposit of not less than the  required dollar amount of the bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In place of the individual bond on each separate operation, a  blanket bond covering hardrock mining operations may be furnished, at  the option of the operator, if the terms and conditions as determined by  the authorized officer are sufficient to comply with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that an approved plan of operations is modified in  accordance with Sec. 3802.1-5 of this title, the authorized officer  shall review the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, shall  require that the amount of bond be adjusted to conform to the plan of  operations, as modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a mining claim is patented, except for the California  Desert Conservation Area, the authorized officer shall release the  operator from that portion of the performance bond and plan of  operations which applies to operations within the boundaries of the  patented land. The authorized officer shall release the operator from  the remainder of the performance bond and plan of operations (covering  approved means of access outside the boundaries of the mining claim)  when the operator has either completed reclamation in accordance with  paragraph (f) of this section or those requirements are waived by the  authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When all or any portion of the reclamation has been completed in  accordance with paragraph (h) of Sec. 3802.3-2 of this title, the  operator shall notify the authorized officer who shall promptly make a  joint inspection with the operator. The authorized officer shall then  notify the operator whether the performance under the plan of operations  is accepted. When the authorized officer has accepted as completed any  portion of the reclamation, he shall reduce proportionally the amount of  bond with respect to the remaining reclamation.</p>
