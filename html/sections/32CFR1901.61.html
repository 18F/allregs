                            <p class="depth0">Purpose of exemptions. This part sets forth those systems of records  or portions of systems of records which the Director of Central  Intelligence has determined to exempt from the procedures established by  this regulation and from certain provisions of the Privacy Act:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the following specified general exemption of  polygraph records is to prevent access and review of records which  intimately reveal CIA operational methods. The purpose of the general  exemption from the provisions of sections (c)(3) and (e)(3) (A)-(D) of  the Privacy Act is to avoid disclosures that may adversely affect  ongoing operational relationships with other intelligence and related  organizations and thus reveal or jeopardize intelligence sources and  methods or risk exposure of intelligence sources   and methods in the processing of covert employment applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of the general exemption from sections (d),  (e)(4)(G), (f)(1), and (g) of the Privacy Act is to protect only those  portions of systems of records which if revealed would risk exposure of  intelligence sources and methods or hamper the ability of the CIA to  effectively use information received from other agencies or foreign  governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It should be noted that by subjecting information which would  consist of, reveal, or pertain to intelligence sources and methods to  separate determinations by the Director of Central Intelligence under  the provision entitled ``General exemptions,'' 32 CFR 1901.62 regarding  access and notice, an intent is established to apply the exemption from  access and notice only in those cases where notice in itself would  constitute a revelation of intelligence sources and methods; in all  cases where only access to information would reveal such source or  method, notice will be given upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The purpose of the general exemption for records that consist  of, pertain to, or would otherwise reveal the identities of employees  who provide information to the Office of the Inspector General is to  implement section 17 of the CIA Act of 1949, as amended, 50 U.S.C.  403q(e)(3), and to ensure that no action constituting a reprisal or  threat of reprisal is taken because an employee has cooperated with the  Office of Inspector General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The purpose of the specific exemptions provided for under  section (k) of the Privacy Act is to exempt only those portions of  systems of records which would consist of, reveal, or pertain to that  information which is enumerated in that section of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In each case, the Director of Central Intelligence currently or  then in office has determined that the enumerated classes of information  should be exempt in order to comply with dealing with the proper  classification of national defense or foreign policy information;  protect the identification of persons who provide information to the CIA  Inspector General; protect the privacy of other persons who supplied  information under an implied or express grant of confidentiality in the  case of law enforcement or employment and security suitability  investigations (or promotion material in the case of the armed  services); protect information used in connection with protective  services under 18 U.S.C. 3056; protect the efficacy of testing  materials; and protect information which is required by statute to be  maintained and used solely as statistical records.</p>
