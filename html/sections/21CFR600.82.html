                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notification of a permanent discontinuance or an interruption in manufacturing. (1) An applicant of a biological product, other than blood or blood components for transfusion, which is licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, and which may be dispensed only under prescription under section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), must notify FDA in writing of a permanent discontinuance of manufacture of the biological product or an interruption in manufacturing of the biological product that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in supply of that biological product in the United States if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The biological product is life supporting, life sustaining, or intended for use in the prevention or treatment of a debilitating disease or condition, including any such biological product used in emergency medical care or during surgery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The biological product is not a radiopharmaceutical biological product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An applicant of blood or blood components for transfusion, which is licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, and which may be dispensed only under prescription under section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, must notify FDA in writing of a permanent discontinuance of manufacture of any product listed in its license or an interruption in manufacturing of any such product that is likely to lead to a significant disruption in supply of that product in the United States if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The product is life supporting, life sustaining, or intended for use in the prevention or treatment of a debilitating disease or condition, including any such product used in emergency medical care or during surgery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant is a manufacturer of a significant percentage of the U.S. blood supply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Submission and timing of notification. Notifications required by paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to FDA electronically in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At least 6 months prior to the date of the permanent discontinuance or interruption in manufacturing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If 6 months' advance notice is not possible because the permanent discontinuance or interruption in manufacturing was not reasonably anticipated 6 months in advance, as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no case later than 5 business days after such a permanent discontinuance or interruption in manufacturing occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information included in notification. Notifications required by paragraph (a) of this section must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name of the biological product subject to the notification, including the National Drug Code for such biological product, or an alternative standard for identification and labeling that has been recognized as acceptable by the Center Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name of the applicant of the biological product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the notification relates to a permanent discontinuance of the biological product or an interruption in manufacturing of the biological product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A description of the reason for the permanent discontinuance or interruption in manufacturing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The estimated duration of the interruption in manufacturing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> Public list of biological product shortages. FDA will maintain a publicly available list of biological products that are determined by FDA to be in shortage. This biological product shortages list will include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Public list of biological product shortages. FDA will maintain a publicly available list of biological products that are determined by FDA to be in shortage. This biological product shortages list will include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The names and National Drug Codes for such biological products, or

the alternative standards for identification and labeling that have been recognized as acceptable by the Center Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name of each applicant for such biological products;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The reason for the shortage, as determined by FDA, selecting from the following categories: Requirements related to complying with good manufacturing practices; regulatory delay; shortage of an active ingredient; shortage of an inactive ingredient component; discontinuation of the manufacture of the biological product; delay in shipping of the biological product; demand increase for the biological product; or other reason; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The estimated duration of the shortage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Confidentiality. FDA may choose not to make information collected to implement this paragraph available on the biological product shortages list or available under section 506C(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356c(c)) if FDA determines that disclosure of such information would adversely affect the public health (such as by increasing the possibility of hoarding or other disruption of the availability of the biological product to patients). FDA will also not provide information on the public shortages list or under section 506C(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that is protected by 18 U.S.C. 1905 or 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), including trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is considered confidential or privileged under Sec. 20.61 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Noncompliance letters.

The following definitions of terms apply to this section:</p><p class="depth0">Biological product shortage or shortage means a period of time when the demand or projected demand for the biological product within the United States exceeds the supply of the biological product.</p><p class="depth0">Intended for use in the prevention or treatment of a debilitating disease or condition means a biological product intended for use in the prevention or treatment of a disease or condition associated with mortality or morbidity that has a substantial impact on day-to-day functioning.</p><p class="depth0">Life supporting or life sustaining means a biological product that is essential to, or that yields information that is essential to, the restoration or continuation of a bodily function important to the continuation of human life.</p><p class="depth0">Meaningful disruption means a change in production that is reasonably likely to lead to a reduction in the supply of a biological product by a manufacturer that is more than negligible and affects the ability of the manufacturer to fill orders or meet expected demand for its product, and does not include interruptions in manufacturing due to matters such as routine maintenance or insignificant changes in manufacturing so long as the manufacturer expects to resume operations in a short period of time.</p><p class="depth0">Significant disruption means a change in production that is reasonably likely to lead to a reduction in the supply of blood or blood components by a manufacturer that substantially affects the ability of the manufacturer to fill orders or meet expected demand for its product, and does not include interruptions in manufacturing due to matters such as routine maintenance or insignificant changes in manufacturing so

long as the manufacturer expects to resume operations in a short period of time.
