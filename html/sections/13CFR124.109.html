                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> program  and must meet the eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 124.112 to the  extent the criteria are not inconsistent with this section. ANC-owned  concerns are subject to the same conditions that apply to tribally-owned  concerns, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except  that the following provisions and exceptions apply only to ANC-owned  concerns:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Even though an ANC can be either for profit or non-profit, a  small business concern owned and controlled by an ANC must be for profit  to be eligible for the 8(a) program. The concern will be deemed owned  and controlled by the ANC where both the majority of stock or other  ownership interest and total voting power are held by the ANC and  holders of its settlement common stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provides that a concern  which is majority owned by an ANC shall be deemed to be both owned and  controlled by Alaska Natives and an economically disadvantaged business.  Therefore, an individual responsible for control and management of an  ANC-owned applicant or Participant need not establish personal social  and economic disadvantage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii) and (iv) of this section are not  applicable to an ANC, provided its status as an ANC is clearly shown in  its articles of incorporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not applicable to an ANC- owned concern to the extent it requires an express waiver of sovereign  immunity or a ``sue and be sued'' clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. Once an Indian Tribe establishes that it is  economically disadvantaged in connection with the application for one  Tribally-owned firm, it need not reestablish such status in order to  have other businesses that it owns certified for 8(a) BD program  participation, unless specifically requested to do so by the AA/BD. An  Indian Tribe may request to meet with SBA prior to submitting an  application for 8(a) BD participation for its first applicant firm to  better understand what SBA requires for it to establish economic  disadvantage. Each Tribally-owned concern seeking to be certified for  8(a) BD participation must comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Social disadvantage. An Indian tribe as defined in Sec. 124.3 is  considered to be socially disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Economic disadvantage. In order to be eligible to participate in  the 8(a) BD program, the Indian tribe must demonstrate to SBA that the  tribe itself is economically disadvantaged. This must involve the  consideration of available data showing the tribe's economic condition,  including but not limited to, the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of tribal members.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The present tribal unemployment rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The per capita income of tribal members, excluding judgment  awards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The percentage of the local Indian population below the poverty  level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The tribe's access to capital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The tribal assets as disclosed in a current tribal financial  statement. The statement must list all assets including those which are  encumbered or held in trust, but the status of those encumbered or in  trust must be clearly delineated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A list of all wholly or partially owned tribal enterprises or  affiliates and the primary industry classification of each. The list  must also specify the members of the tribe who manage or control such  enterprises by serving as officers or directors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Forms and documents required to be submitted. Except as  otherwise provided in this section, the Indian tribe generally must  submit the forms and documents required of 8(a) BD applicants as well as  the following material:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of all governing documents such as the tribe's  constitution or business charter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence of its recognition as a tribe eligible for the special  programs and services provided by the United States or by its state of  residence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws as filed  with the organizing or chartering authority, or similar documents needed  to establish and govern a non-corporate legal entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documents or materials needed to show the tribe's economically  disadvantaged status as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(7)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legal business entity organized for profit and susceptible to  suit. The applicant or participating concern must be a separate and  distinct legal entity organized or chartered by the tribe, or Federal or  state authorities. The concern's articles of incorporation, partnership  agreement or limited liability company articles of organization must  contain express sovereign immunity waiver language, or a ``sue and be  sued'' clause which designates United States Federal Courts to be among  the courts of competent jurisdiction for all matters relating to SBA's  programs including, but not limited to, 8(a) BD program participation,  loans, and contract performance. Also, the concern must be organized for  profit, and the tribe must possess economic development powers in the  tribe's governing documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Size. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A tribally-owned applicant concern must qualify as a  small business concern as defined for purposes of Federal Government  procurement in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to  be applied is based on the primary industry classification of the  applicant concern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A tribally-owned Participant must certify to SBA that it is a  small business pursuant to the provisions of part 121 of this title for  the purpose of performing each individual contract which it is awarded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a  socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned  business entity of such tribe) for either 8(a) BD program entry or  contract award, the firm's size shall be determined independently  without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the  tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe,  unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally-owned  business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial  unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ownership. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For corporate entities, a Tribe must  unconditionally own at least 51 percent of the voting stock and at least  51 percent of the aggregate of all classes of stock. For non-corporate  entities, a Tribe must unconditionally own at least a 51 percent  interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A Tribe may not own 51% or more of another firm which, either  at the time of application or within the previous two years, has been  operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary NAICS code as the  applicant. A Tribe may, however, own a Participant or other applicant  that conducts or will conduct secondary business in the 8(a) BD program  under the NAICS code which is the primary NAICS code of the applicant  concern. In addition, once an applicant is admitted to the 8(a) BD  program, it may not receive an 8(a) sole source contract that is a  follow-on contract to an 8(a) contract that was performed immediately  previously by another Participant (or former Participant) owned by the  same Tribe. For purposes of this paragraph, the same primary NAICS code  means the six digit NAICS code having the same corresponding size  standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The restrictions of Sec. 124.105(h) do not apply to tribes;  they do, however, apply to non disadvantaged individuals or other  business concerns that are partial owners of a tribally-owned concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control and management. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The management and daily business  operations of a Tribally-owned concern must be controlled by the Tribe.  The Tribally-owned concern may be controlled by the Tribe through one or  more individuals who possess sufficient management experience of an  extent and complexity needed to run the concern, or through management  as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Management may be provided by committees, teams, or Boards of  Directors which are controlled by one or more members of an economically  disadvantaged tribe, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Management may be provided by non-Tribal members if the concern  can demonstrate that the Tribe can hire and fire those individuals, that  it will   retain control of all management decisions common to boards of  directors, including strategic planning, budget approval, and the  employment and compensation of officers, and that a written management  development plan exists which shows how Tribal members will develop  managerial skills sufficient to manage the concern or similar Tribally- owned concerns in the future.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Members of the management team, business committee members,  officers, and directors are precluded from engaging in any outside  employment or other business interests which conflict with the  management of the concern or prevent the concern from achieving the  objectives set forth in its business development plan. This is not  intended to preclude participation in tribal or other activities which  do not interfere with such individual's responsibilities in the  operation of the applicant concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Individual eligibility limitation. SBA does not deem an  individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a  tribally-owned concern to have used his or her individual eligibility  within the meaning of Sec. 124.108(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Potential for success. A Tribally-owned applicant concern must  possess reasonable prospects for success in competing in the private  sector if admitted to the 8(a) BD program. A Tribally-owned applicant  may establish potential for success by demonstrating that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has been in business for at least two years, as evidenced by  income tax returns (individual or consolidated) for each of the two  previous tax years showing operating revenues in the primary industry in  which the applicant is seeking 8(a) BD certification; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual(s) who will manage and control the daily  business operations of the firm have substantial technical and  management experience, the applicant has a record of successful  performance on contracts from governmental or nongovernmental sources in  its primary industry category, and the applicant has adequate capital to  sustain its operations and carry out its business plan as a Participant;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Tribe has made a firm written commitment to support the  operations of the applicant concern and it has the financial ability to  do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other eligibility criteria. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As with other 8(a) applicants, a  tribally-owned applicant concern shall not be denied admission into the  8(a) program due solely to a determination that specific contract  opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the concern  unless:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to  procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The purchase of such products or services by the Federal  Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the  developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants  providing the same or similar items or services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for the tribe itself, the concern's officers, directors,  and all shareholders owning an interest of 20% or more must demonstrate  good character. See Sec. 124.108(a).  [63 FR 35739, June 30, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 45753, Sept. 4, 2009;  76 FR 8255, Feb. 11, 2011]</p>
