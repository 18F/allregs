                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mission-specific license. A mission-specific license authorizing  an RLV mission authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise  land, one model or type of RLV from a launch site approved for the  mission to a reentry site or other location approved for the mission. A  mission-specific license authorizing an RLV mission may authorize more  than one RLV mission and identifies each flight of an RLV authorized  under the license. A licensee's authorization to conduct RLV missions  terminates upon completion of all activities authorized by the license  or the expiration date stated in the reentry license, whichever occurs  first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operator license. An operator license for RLV missions  authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise land, any of a  designated family of RLVs within authorized parameters, including launch  sites and trajectories, transporting specified classes of payloads to  any reentry site or other location designated in the license. An  operator license for RLV missions is valid for a two-year renewable  term.</p>
