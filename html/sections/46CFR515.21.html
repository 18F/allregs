                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form and amount. Except as otherwise provided in this part, no person may operate as an ocean transportation intermediary unless that person furnishes a bond, proof of insurance, or other surety in a form and amount determined by the Commission to insure financial responsibility. The bond, insurance or other surety covers the transportation-related activities of an ocean transportation intermediary only when acting as an ocean transportation intermediary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person operating in the United States as an ocean freight forwarder as defined by Sec. 515.2(o)(1) shall furnish evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $50,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person operating in the United States as an NVOCC as defined by Sec. 515.2(o)(2) shall furnish evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $75,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any unlicensed foreign-based entity, not operating in the United States as defined in Sec. 515.3, providing ocean transportation intermediary services for transportation to or from the United States, shall furnish evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $150,000. Such foreign entity will be held strictly responsible hereunder for the acts or omissions of its agent in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount of the financial responsibility required to be furnished by any entity pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section shall be increased by $10,000 for each of the applicant's unincorporated branch offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Group financial responsibility. Where a group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries accepts liability for an ocean transportation intermediary's financial responsibility for such ocean transportation intermediary's transportation-related activities under the Act, the group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries must file either a group supplemental coverage bond form, insurance form or guaranty form, clearly identifying each ocean transportation intermediary covered, before a covered ocean transportation intermediary may provide ocean transportation intermediary services. In such cases a group or association must establish financial responsibility in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section for each member or $3,000,000 in aggregate. A group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries may also file an optional bond rider as provided for by Sec. 515.25(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Common trade name. Where more than one person operates under a common trade name, separate proof of financial responsibility is required covering each corporation or person separately providing ocean transportation intermediary services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal military and civilian household goods. Any person which exclusively transports used household goods and personal effects for the account of the Department of Defense, or for the account of the federal civilian executive agencies shipping under the International Household Goods Program administered by the General Services Administration, or both, is not subject to the requirements of subpart C of this part, but may be subject to other requirements, such as alternative surety bonding, imposed by the Department of Defense, or the General Services Administration.
