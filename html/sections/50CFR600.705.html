                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Persons affected by these regulations should be aware that other Federal and state statutes and regulations may apply to their activities.

Vessel operators may wish to refer to USCG regulations found in the Code of Federal Regulations title 33--Navigation and Navigable Waters and 46--Shipping; 15 CFR part 904, subpart D--Permit Sanctions and Denials; and title 43--Public Lands (in regard to marine sanctuaries).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State responsibilities. Certain responsibilities relating to data collection and enforcement may be performed by authorized state personnel under a state/Federal agreement for data collection and a tripartite agreement among the state, the USCG, and the Secretary for enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submarine cables. Fishing vessel operators must exercise due care in the conduct of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage to the submarine cables resulting from intentional acts or from the failure to exercise due care in the conduct of fishing operations subjects the fishing vessel operator to the criminal penalties prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) which implements the International Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. Fishing vessel operators also should be aware that the Submarine Cable Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance of less than 1 nautical mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying or repairing a submarine cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 nautical mile (0.46 km) from a buoy or buoys intended to mark the position of a cable when being laid or when out of order or broken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Marine mammals. Regulations governing exemption permits and the recordkeeping and reporting of the incidental take of marine mammals are set forth in part 229 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Halibut fishing. Fishing for halibut is governed by regulations of the International Pacific Halibut Commission set forth at part 300 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Marine sanctuaries. All fishing activity, regardless of species sought, is prohibited under 15 CFR part 924 in the U.S.S. Monitor Marine Sanctuary, which is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Cape Hatteras off the coast of North Carolina.</p>
