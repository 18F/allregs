A claim normally accrues at the time of injury when essential operative facts are apparent. However, in other instances, especially in complex medical malpractice cases, a claim accrues when the claimant discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of the act that resulted in the claimed loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In computing the statutory time period, the day of the incident is excluded and the day the claim was filed is included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Air Force has 6 months to consider a properly filed claim, after which the claimant may file suit. The claimant's right to sue ends 6 months from the date the final denial is mailed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Properly asserted third party actions, as permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may be brought against the United States without first filing a claim. In such instances those actions may start more than 2 years after the claim has accrued.
