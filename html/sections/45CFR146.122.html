In determining the degree of  the relationship, relatives by less than full consanguinity (such as  half-siblings, who share only one parent) are treated the same as  relatives by full consanguinity (such as siblings who share both  parents).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First-degree relatives include parents, spouses, siblings, and  children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Second-degree relatives include grandparents, grandchildren,  aunts, uncles, nephews, and nieces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Third-degree relatives include great-grandparents, great- grandchildren, great aunts, great uncles, and first cousins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fourth-degree relatives include great-great grandparents, great- great grandchildren, and children of first cousins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Genetic information means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, with  respect to an individual, information about--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual's genetic tests (as defined in paragraph (a)(5)  of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The genetic tests of family members of the individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manifestation (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this  section) of a disease or disorder in family members of the individual;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any request for, or receipt of, genetic services (as defined in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section), or participation in clinical research  which includes genetic services, by the individual or any family member  of the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term genetic information does not include information about  the sex or age of any individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term genetic information includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to a pregnant woman (or a family member of the  pregnant woman), genetic information of any fetus carried by the  pregnant woman; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to an individual (or a family member of the  individual) who is utilizing an assisted reproductive technology,  genetic information of any embryo legally held by the individual or  family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Genetic services means --</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A genetic test, as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Genetic counseling (including obtaining, interpreting, or  assessing genetic information); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Genetic education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Genetic test means an analysis of human DNA, RNA,  chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites, if the analysis   detects genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes. However, a genetic  test does not include an analysis of proteins or metabolites that is  directly related to a manifested disease, disorder, or pathological  condition. Accordingly, a test to determine whether an individual has a  BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant is a genetic test. Similarly, a test to determine  whether an individual has a genetic variant associated with hereditary  nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is a genetic test. However, an HIV test,  complete blood count, cholesterol test, liver function test, or test for  the presence of alcohol or drugs is not a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of this paragraph (a)(5) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A is a newborn covered under a group  health plan. A undergoes a phenylketonuria (PKU) screening, which  measures the concentration of a metabolite, phenylalanine, in A's blood.  In PKU, a mutation occurs in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene  which contains instructions for making the enzyme needed to break down  the amino acid phenylalanine. Individuals with the mutation, who have a  deficiency in the enzyme to break down phenylalanine, have high  concentrations of phenylalanine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example, the PKU screening is a genetic  test with respect to A because the screening is an analysis of  metabolites that detects a genetic mutation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manifestation or manifested means, with respect to a disease,  disorder, or pathological condition, that an individual has been or  could reasonably be diagnosed with the disease, disorder, or  pathological condition by a health care professional with appropriate  training and expertise in the field of medicine involved. For purposes  of this section, a disease, disorder, or pathological condition is not  manifested if a diagnosis is based principally on genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of this paragraph (a)(6) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A has a family medical history of  diabetes. A begins to experience excessive sweating, thirst, and  fatigue. A's physician examines A and orders blood glucose testing  (which is not a genetic test). Based on the physician's examination, A's  symptoms, and test results that show elevated levels of blood glucose,  A's physician diagnoses A as having adult onset diabetes mellitus (Type  2 diabetes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, A has been diagnosed by a health  care professional with appropriate training and expertise in the field  of medicine involved. The diagnosis is not based principally on genetic  information. Thus, Type 2 diabetes is manifested with respect to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B has several family members with  colon cancer. One of them underwent genetic testing which detected a  mutation in the MSH2 gene associated with hereditary nonpolyposis  colorectal cancer (HNPCC). B's physician, a health care professional  with appropriate training and expertise in the field of medicine  involved, recommends that B undergo a targeted genetic test to look for  the specific mutation found in B 's relative to determine if B has an  elevated risk for cancer. The genetic test with respect to B showed that  B also carries the mutation and is at increased risk to develop  colorectal and other cancers associated with HNPCC. B has a colonoscopy  which indicates no signs of disease, and B has no symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, because B has no signs or  symptoms of colorectal cancer, B has not been and could not reasonably  be diagnosed with HNPCC. Thus, HNPCC is not manifested with respect to  B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 2, except that B's  colonoscopy and subsequent tests indicate the presence of HNPCC. Based  on the colonoscopy and subsequent test results, B's physician makes a  diagnosis of HNPCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, HNPCC is manifested with respect  to B because a health care professional with appropriate training and  expertise in the field of medicine involved has made a diagnosis that is  not based principally on genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual C has a family member that has been  diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. A genetic test indicates that C has  the Huntington's Disease gene variant. At age 42, C begins suffering  from occasional moodiness and disorientation, symptoms which are  associated with Huntington's Disease. C is examined by a neurologist (a  physician with appropriate training and expertise for diagnosing  Huntington's Disease). The examination includes a clinical neurological  exam. The results of the examination do not support a diagnosis of  Huntington's Disease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, C is not and could not  reasonably be diagnosed with Huntington's Disease by a health care  professional with appropriate training and expertise. Therefore,  Huntington's Disease is not manifested with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except that C  exhibits additional neurological and behavioral symptoms, and the  results of the examination support a diagnosis of Huntington's Disease  with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, C could reasonably be diagnosed  with Huntington's Disease by a health care professional with appropriate  training and expertise. Therefore, Huntington's Disease is manifested  with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Underwriting purposes has the meaning given in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No group-based discrimination based on genetic information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general. For purposes of this section, a group health plan, and a  health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection  with a group health plan, must not adjust premium or contribution  amounts for the plan, or any group of similarly situated individuals  under the plan, on the basis of genetic information. For this purpose,  ``similarly situated individuals'' are those described in Sec.  146.121(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section) limits the  ability of a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage  in connection with a group health plan to increase the premium for a  group health plan or a group of similarly situated individuals under the  plan based on the manifestation of a disease or disorder of an  individual who is enrolled in the plan. In such a case, however, the  manifestation of a disease or disorder in one individual cannot also be  used as genetic information about other group members to further  increase the premium for a group health plan or a group of similarly  situated individuals under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that  provides coverage through a health insurance issuer. In order to  determine the premium rate for the upcoming plan year, the issuer  reviews the claims experience of individuals covered under the plan and  other health status information of the individuals, including genetic  information. The issuer finds that three individuals covered under the  plan had unusually high claims experience. In addition, the issuer finds  that the genetic information of two other individuals indicates the  individuals have a higher probability of developing certain illnesses  although the illnesses are not manifested at this time. The issuer  quotes the plan a higher per-participant rate because of both the  genetic information and the higher claims experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the issuer violates the  provisions of this paragraph (b) because the issuer adjusts the premium  based on genetic information. However, if the adjustment related solely  to claims experience, the adjustment would not violate the requirements  of this section (nor would it violate the requirements of paragraph (c)  of Sec. 146.121 of this part, which prohibits discrimination in  individual premiums or contributions based on a health factor but  permits increases in the group rate based on a health factor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that  provides coverage through a health insurance issuer. In order to  determine the premium rate for the upcoming plan year, the issuer  reviews the claims experience of individuals covered under the plan and  other health status information of the individuals, including genetic  information. The issuer finds that Employee A has made claims for  treatment of polycystic kidney disease. A also has two dependent  children covered under the plan. The issuer quotes the plan a higher  per-participant rate because of both A's claims experience and the  family medical history of A's children (that is, the fact that A has the  disease).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the issuer violates the  provisions of this paragraph (b) because, by taking the likelihood that  A's children may develop polycystic kidney disease into account in  computing the rate for the plan, the issuer adjusts the premium based on  genetic information relating to a condition that has not been manifested  in A's children. However, it is permissible for the issuer to increase  the premium based on A's claims experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on requesting or requiring genetic testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a  group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering health  insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, must not  request or require an individual or a family member of the individual to  undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Health care professional may recommend a genetic test. Nothing  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section limits the authority of a health  care professional   who is providing health care services to an individual to request that  the individual undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A goes to a physician for a routine  physical examination. The physician reviews A's family medical history  and A informs the physician that A's mother has been diagnosed with  Huntington's Disease. The physician advises A that Huntington's Disease  is hereditary and recommends that A undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the physician is a health care  professional who is providing health care services to A. Therefore, the  physician's recommendation that A undergo the genetic test does not  violate this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B is covered by a health  maintenance organization (HMO). B is a child being treated for leukemia.  B's physician, who is employed by the HMO, is considering a treatment  plan that includes six-mercaptopurine, a drug for treating leukemia in  most children. However, the drug could be fatal if taken by a small  percentage of children with a particular gene variant. B's physician  recommends that B undergo a genetic test to detect this variant before  proceeding with this course of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, even though the physician is  employed by the HMO, the physician is nonetheless a health care  professional who is providing health care services to B. Therefore, the  physician's recommendation that B undergo the genetic test does not  violate this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination regarding payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. As provided in  this paragraph (c)(4), nothing in paragraph (c)(1) of this section  precludes a plan or issuer from obtaining and using the results of a  genetic test in making a determination regarding payment. For this  purpose, ``payment'' has the meaning given such term in Sec. 164.501 of  the privacy regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act. Thus, if a plan or issuer conditions payment for  an item or service based on its medical appropriateness and the medical  appropriateness of the item or service depends on the genetic makeup of  a patient, then the plan or issuer is permitted to condition payment for  the item or service on the outcome of a genetic test. The plan or issuer  may also refuse payment if the patient does not undergo the genetic  test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. A plan or issuer is permitted to request only the  minimum amount of information necessary to make a determination  regarding payment. The minimum amount of information necessary is  determined in accordance with the minimum necessary standard in Sec.  164.502(b) of the privacy regulations issued under the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. See paragraph (e) of this section for examples  illustrating the rules of this paragraph (c)(4), as well as other  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Research in accordance with Federal regulations and applicable  State or local law or regulations. The plan or issuer makes the request  pursuant to research, as defined in Sec. 46.102(d) of this subtitle,  that complies with part 46 of this subtitle or equivalent Federal  regulations, and any applicable State or local law or regulations for  the protection of human subjects in research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Written request for participation in research. The plan or  issuer makes the request in writing, and the request clearly indicates  to each participant or beneficiary (or, in the case of a minor child, to  the legal guardian of the beneficiary) that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Compliance with the request is voluntary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Noncompliance will have no effect on eligibility for benefits  (as described in Sec. 146.121(b)(1) of this part) or premium or  contribution amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prohibition on underwriting. No genetic information collected  or acquired under this paragraph (c)(5) can be used for underwriting  purposes (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notice to Federal agencies. The plan or issuer completes a copy  of the ``Notice of Research Exception under the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act'' authorized by the Secretary and provides the  notice to   the address specified in the instructions thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibitions on collection of genetic information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For  underwriting purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A group health plan, and a  health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection  with a group health plan, must not collect (as defined in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section) genetic information for underwriting purposes.  See paragraph (e) of this section for examples illustrating the rules of  this paragraph (d)(1), as well as other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Underwriting purposes defined. Subject to paragraph (d)(1)(iii)  of this section, underwriting purposes means, with respect to any group  health plan, or health insurance coverage offered in connection with a  group health plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rules for, or determination of, eligibility (including  enrollment and continued eligibility) for benefits under the plan or  coverage as described in Sec. 146.121(b)(1)(ii) of this part (including  changes in deductibles or other cost-sharing mechanisms in return for  activities such as completing a health risk assessment or participating  in a wellness program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The computation of premium or contribution amounts under the  plan or coverage (including discounts, rebates, payments in kind, or  other premium differential mechanisms in return for activities such as  completing a health risk assessment or participating in a wellness  program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The application of any preexisting condition exclusion under the  plan or coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other activities related to the creation, renewal, or  replacement of a contract of health insurance or health benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, as well as other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to or in connection with enrollment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering health  insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, must not  collect genetic information with respect to any individual prior to that  individual's effective date of coverage under that plan or coverage, nor  in connection with the rules for eligibility (as defined in Sec.  146.121(b)(1)(ii) of this part) that apply to that individual. Whether  or not an individual's information is collected prior to that  individual's effective date of coverage is determined at the time of  collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incidental collection exception--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a group  health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering health insurance  coverage in connection with a group health plan, obtains genetic  information incidental to the collection of other information concerning  any individual, the collection is not a violation of this paragraph  (d)(2), as long as the collection is not for underwriting purposes in  violation of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitation. The incidental collection exception of this  paragraph (d)(2)(ii) does not apply in connection with any collection  where it is reasonable to anticipate that health information will be  received, unless the collection explicitly states that genetic  information should not be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides a premium  reduction to enrollees who complete a health risk assessment. The health  risk assessment is requested to be completed after enrollment. Whether  or not it is completed or what responses are given on it has no effect  on an individual's enrollment status, or on the enrollment status of  members of the individual's family. The health risk assessment includes  questions about the individual's family medical history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the health risk assessment  includes a request for genetic information (that is, the individual's  family medical history). Because completing the health risk assessment  results in a premium reduction, the request for genetic information is  for underwriting purposes. Consequently, the request violates the  prohibition on the collection of genetic information in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The same facts as Example 1, except there is  no premium reduction or any other reward for completing the health risk  assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the request is not for  underwriting purposes, nor is it prior to or in connection with  enrollment. Therefore, it does not violate the prohibition on the  collection of genetic information in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requests that enrollees  complete a health risk assessment prior to enrollment, and includes  questions about the individual's family medical history. There is no  reward or penalty for completing the health risk assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  there is no premium reduction or any other reward given for completion  of the health risk assessment. However, certain people completing the  health risk assessment may become eligible for additional benefits under  the plan by being enrolled in a disease management program based on  their answers to questions about family medical history. Other people  may become eligible for the disease management program based solely on  their answers to questions about their individual medical history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the request for information  about an individual's family medical history could result in the  individual being eligible for benefits for which the individual would  not otherwise be eligible. Therefore, the questions about family medical  history on the health risk assessment are a request for genetic  information for underwriting purposes and are prohibited under this  paragraph (d). Although the plan conditions eligibility for the disease  management program based on determinations of medical appropriateness,  the exception for determinations of medical appropriateness does not  apply because the individual is not seeking benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requests enrollees to  complete two distinct health risk assessments (HRAs) after and unrelated  to enrollment. The first HRA instructs the individual to answer only for  the individual and not for the individual's family. The first HRA does  not ask about any genetic tests the individual has undergone or any  genetic services the individual has received. The plan offers a reward  for completing the first HRA. The second HRA asks about family medical  history and the results of genetic tests the individual has undergone.  The plan offers no reward for completing the second HRA and the  instructions make clear that completion of the second HRA is wholly  voluntary and will not affect the reward given for completion of the  first HRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, no genetic information is  collected in connection with the first HRA, which offers a reward, and  no benefits or other rewards are conditioned on the request for genetic  information in the second HRA. Consequently, the request for genetic  information in the second HRA is not for underwriting purposes, and the  two HRAs do not violate the prohibition on the collection of genetic  information in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan waives its annual  deductible for enrollees who complete an HRA. The HRA is requested to be  completed after enrollment. Whether or not the HRA is completed or what  responses are given on it has no effect on an individual's enrollment  status, or on the enrollment status of members of the individual's  family. The HRA does not include any direct questions about the  individual's genetic information (including family medical history).  However, the last question reads, ``Is there anything else relevant to  your health that you would like us to know or discuss with you?''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, the plan's request for medical  information does not explicitly state that genetic information should  not be provided. Therefore, any genetic information collected in  response to   the question is not within the incidental collection exception and is  prohibited under this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 6, except that the last  question goes on to state, ``In answering this question, you should not  include any genetic information. That is, please do not include any  family medical history or any information related to genetic testing,  genetic services, genetic counseling, or genetic diseases for which you  believe you may be at risk.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 7, the plan's request for medical  information explicitly states that genetic information should not be  provided. Therefore, any genetic information collected in response to  the question is within the incidental collection exception. However, the  plan may not use any genetic information it obtains incidentally for  underwriting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Issuer M acquires Issuer N. M requests N's  records, stating that N should not provide genetic information and  should review the records to excise any genetic information. N assembles  the data requested by M and, although N reviews it to delete genetic  information, the data from a specific region included some individuals'  family medical history. Consequently, M receives genetic information  about some of N's covered individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 8, M's request for health  information explicitly stated that genetic information should not be  provided. Therefore, the collection of genetic information was within  the incidental collection exception. However, M may not use the genetic  information it obtained incidentally for underwriting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples regarding determinations of medical appropriateness.  The application of the rules of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section  to plan or issuer determinations of medical appropriateness is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A group health plan covers genetic  testing for celiac disease for individuals who have family members with  this condition. After A's son is diagnosed with celiac disease, A  undergoes a genetic test and promptly submits a claim for the test to  A's issuer for reimbursement. The issuer asks A to provide the results  of the genetic test before the claim is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, under the rules of paragraph  (c)(4) of this section the issuer is permitted to request only the  minimum amount of information necessary to make a decision regarding  payment. Because the results of the test are not necessary for the  issuer to make a decision regarding the payment of A's claim, the  issuer's request for the results of the genetic test violates paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B's group health plan covers a  yearly mammogram for participants and beneficiaries starting at age 40,  or at age 30 for those with increased risk for breast cancer, including  individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. B is 33 years old and  has the BRCA2 mutation. B undergoes a mammogram and promptly submits a  claim to B's plan for reimbursement. Following an established policy,  the plan asks B for evidence of increased risk of breast cancer, such as  the results of a genetic test or a family history of breast cancer,  before the claim for the mammogram is paid. This policy is applied  uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and is not directed at  individuals based on any genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan does not violate  paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section. Under paragraph (c), the plan is  permitted to request and use the results of a genetic test to make a  determination regarding payment, provided the plan requests only the  minimum amount of information necessary. Because the medical  appropriateness of the mammogram depends on the genetic makeup of the  patient, the minimum amount of information necessary includes the  results of the genetic test. Similarly, the plan does not violate  paragraph (d) of this section because the plan is permitted to request  genetic information in making a determination regarding the medical  appropriateness of a claim if the genetic information is necessary to  make the determination (and if the genetic information is not used for  underwriting purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual C was previously diagnosed with and  treated for breast cancer, which is currently in remission. In  accordance with the recommendation of C's physician, C has been taking a  regular dose of tamoxifen to help prevent a recurrence. C's group health  plan adopts a new policy requiring patients taking tamoxifen to undergo  a genetic test to ensure that tamoxifen is medically appropriate for  their genetic makeup. In accordance with, at the time, the latest  scientific research, tamoxifen is not helpful in up to 7 percent of  breast cancer patients, those with certain variations of the gene for  making the CYP2D6 enzyme. If a patient has a gene variant  making tamoxifen not medically appropriate, the plan does not pay for  the tamoxifen prescription.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the plan does not violate  paragraph (c) of this section if it conditions future payments for the  tamoxifen prescription on C's undergoing a genetic test to determine  what genetic markers C has for making the CYP2D6 enzyme. Nor  does the plan violate paragraph (c) of this section if the plan refuses  future   payment if the results of the genetic test indicate that tamoxifen is  not medically appropriate for C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan offers a diabetes disease  management program to all similarly situated individuals for whom it is  medically appropriate based on whether the individuals have or are at  risk for diabetes. The program provides enhanced benefits related only  to diabetes for individuals who qualify for the program. The plan sends  out a notice to all participants that describes the diabetes disease  management program and explains the terms for eligibility. Individuals  interested in enrolling in the program are advised to contact the plan  to demonstrate that they have diabetes or that they are at risk for  diabetes. For individuals who do not currently have diabetes, genetic  information may be used to demonstrate that an individual is at risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the plan may condition benefits  under the disease management program upon a showing by an individual  that the individual is at risk for diabetes, even if such showing may  involve genetic information, provided that the plan requests genetic  information only when necessary to make a determination regarding  whether the disease management program is medically appropriate for the  individual and only requests the minimum amount of information necessary  to make that determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except that the plan  includes a questionnaire that asks about the occurrence of diabetes in  members of the individual's family as part of the notice describing the  disease management program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the plan violates the  requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because the requests  for genetic information are not limited to those situations in which it  is necessary to make a determination regarding whether the disease  management program is medically appropriate for the individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except the disease  management program provides an enhanced benefit in the form of a lower  annual deductible to individuals under the program; the lower deductible  applies with respect to all medical expenses incurred by the individual.  Thus, whether or not a claim relates to diabetes, the individual is  provided with a lower deductible based on the individual providing the  plan with genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, because the enhanced benefits  include benefits not related to the determination of medical  appropriateness, making available the enhanced benefits is within the  meaning of underwriting purposes. Accordingly, the plan may not request  or require genetic information (including family history information) in  determining eligibility for enhanced benefits under the program because  such a request would be for underwriting purposes and would violate  paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Applicability date. This section applies for plan years  beginning on or after December 7, 2009.  [74 FR 51688, Oct. 7, 2009]</p>
