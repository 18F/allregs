                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the performance requirements of this subpart. The flight safety analysis must also meet the requirements for methods of analysis contained in appendices A and B of this part for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system and appendices B and C of this part for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system except as otherwise permitted by this section. A flight safety analysis for a launch may rely on an earlier analysis from an identical or similar launch if the analysis still applies to the later launch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of analysis. (1) For each launch, a launch operator's flight safety analysis must use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each launch, a launch operator's flight safety analysis must use--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A method approved by the FAA during the licensing process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A method approved as a license modification by the FAA; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the launch takes place from a Federal launch range, a method approved as part of the FAA's launch site safety assessment of the Federal range's processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appendix A of this part contains requirements that apply to all methods of flight safety analysis. A licensee must notify the FAA for any change to the flight safety analysis method. A licensee must file any material change with the FAA as a request for license modification before the launch to which the proposed change would apply. Section 417.11 contains requirements governing a license modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternate analysis method. The FAA will approve an alternate flight safety analysis method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with Sec. 406.3(b), that its proposed analysis method provides an equivalent level of fidelity to that required by this subpart. A launch operator must demonstrate that an alternate flight safety analysis method is based on accurate data and scientific principles and is statistically valid. The FAA will not find a launch operator's application for a license or license modification sufficiently complete to begin review under Sec. 413.11 of this chapter until the FAA approves the alternate flight safety analysis method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Analyses performed by a Federal launch range. This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a flight safety analysis used by a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of flight safety analysis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the range's analysis methods satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's analysis as that of a launch operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Analysis products. For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraph (d) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate to the FAA compliance with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by part 415 subpart F of this chapter, part 417 subpart A, and appendices A, B, C, and I of this part, depending on whether the launch vehicle uses a flight safety system or a wind-weighting safety system.</p>
