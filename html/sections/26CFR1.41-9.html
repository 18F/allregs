                                Sec.  1.41-9  Alternative simplified credit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> equals the amount determined  under section 41(c)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer may elect to apply the  provisions of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) in section  41(c)(5) for any taxable year of the taxpayer ending after December 31,  2006. If a taxpayer makes an election under section 41(c)(5), the  election applies to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent  taxable years unless revoked in the manner prescribed in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner of election. A taxpayer makes an election under  section 41(c)(5) by completing the portion of Form 6765, ``Credit for  Increasing Research Activities,'' (or successor form) relating to the  election of the ASC, and attaching the completed form to the taxpayer's  timely filed (including extensions) original return for the taxable year  to which the election applies. A taxpayer may make an election under  section 41(c)(5) for a tax year on an amended return, but only if the  taxpayer has not previously claimed a section 41(a)(1) credit on its  original return or an amended return for that tax year, and only if that  tax year is not closed by the period of limitations on assessment under  section 6501(a). An extension of time to make an election under section  41(c)(5) will not be granted under Sec.  301.9100-3 of this chapter. A  taxpayer that is a member of a controlled group in a tax year may not  make an election under section 41(c)(5) for that tax year on an amended  return   if any member of the controlled group for that tax year previously  claimed the research credit under section 41(a)(1) using a method other  than the ASC on an original or amended return for that tax year. See  paragraph (b)(4) of this section for additional rules concerning  controlled groups. See also Sec.  1.41-6(b)(1) requiring that all  members of the controlled group use the same method of computation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revocation. An election under this section may not be revoked  except with the consent of the Commissioner. A taxpayer is deemed to  have requested, and to have been granted, the consent of the  Commissioner to revoke an election under section 41(c)(5) if the  taxpayer completes the portion of Form 6765 (or successor form) relating  to the credit determined under section 41(a)(1) (the regular credit) or  the alternative incremental credit (AIRC) and attaches the completed  form to the taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) original  return for the year to which the revocation applies. An election under  section 41(c)(5) may not be revoked on an amended return. An extension  of time to revoke an election under section 41(c)(5) will not be granted  under Sec.  301.9100-3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for controlled groups--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case  of a controlled group of corporations, all the members of which are not  included on a single consolidated return, an election (or revocation)  must be made by the designated member by satisfying the requirements of  paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section (whichever applies), and  such election (or revocation) by the designated member shall be binding  on all the members of the group for the credit year to which the  election (or revocation) relates. If the designated member fails to  timely make (or revoke) an election, each member of the group must  compute the group credit using the method used to compute the group  credit for the immediately preceding credit year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designated member. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), for  any credit year, the term designated member means that member of the  group that is allocated the greatest amount of the group credit under  Sec.  1.41-6(c) based on the amount of credit reported on the taxpayer's  timely filed (including extensions) original Federal income tax return  (even if that member subsequently is determined not to be the designated  member). If the members of a group compute the group credit using  different methods (the method described in section 41(a)(1), the AIRC  method of section 41(c)(4), or the ASC method of section 41(c)(5)) and  at least two members of the group qualify as the designated member, then  the term designated member means that member that computes the group  credit using the method that yields the greatest group credit. For  example, A, B, C, and D are members of a controlled group but are not  members of a consolidated group. For the 2011 taxable year (the credit  year), the group credit using the method described in section 41(a)(1)  is $10x. Under this method, A would be allocated $5x of the group  credit, which would be the largest share of the group credit under this  method. For the credit year, the group credit using the ASC method is  $15x. Under the ASC method, C would be allocated $5x of the group  credit, which is the largest share of the group credit computed using  the ASC method. Because the group credit is greatest using the ASC  method and C is allocated the greatest amount of credit under that  method, C is the designated member. Therefore, if C makes a section  41(c)(5) election on its timely filed (including extensions) original  return for the credit year, that election is binding on all members of  the group for the credit year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualified research expenses (QREs) required  in all years. Unless a taxpayer has QREs in each of the three taxable  years preceding the taxable year for which the credit is being  determined, the credit equals that percentage of the QREs for the  taxable year provided by section 41(c)(5)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 41(c)(6) applicability. QREs for the three taxable years  preceding the credit year must be determined on a basis consistent with  the definition of QREs for the credit year, without regard to the law in  effect for the three taxable years preceding the credit year. This  consistency requirement applies even if the period for filing a claim  for credit or refund has expired   for any of the three taxable years preceding the credit year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Short taxable years--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If one or more of the  three taxable years preceding the credit year is a short taxable year,  then the QREs for such year are deemed to be equal to the QREs actually  paid or incurred in that year multiplied by 365 and divided by the  number of days in that year. If a credit year is a short taxable year,  then the average QREs for the three taxable years preceding the credit  year are modified by multiplying that amount by the number of days in  the short taxable year and dividing the result by 365.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limited exception. Returns filed for taxable years ending after  December 31, 2006, and before June 9, 2011, and for which the period of  limitations has not expired, may be amended to apply the daily  calculation for short taxable years provided in paragraph (3)(i) of this  section in lieu of the monthly calculation for short taxable years  provided in Sec.  1.41-9T(c)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Controlled groups. For purposes of computing the group credit  under Sec.  1.41-6, a controlled group must apply the rules of this  paragraph (c) on an aggregate basis. For example, if the controlled  group has QREs in each of the three taxable years preceding the taxable  year for which the credit is being determined, the controlled group  applies the credit computation provided by section 41(c)(5)(A) rather  than section 41(c)(5)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability dates. This section is applicable for  taxable years ending after June 9, 2011. For taxable years ending on or  before June 9, 2011, see Sec.  1.41-9T as contained in 26 CFR part 1,  revised April 1, 2011. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies to  elections with respect to taxable years ending on or after February 27,  2015. For taxable years ending before February 27, 2015, see Sec.  1.41- 9T as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2015.  [T.D. 9528, 76 FR 33996, June 10, 2011, as amended by T.D. 9666, 79 FR  31864, June 3, 2014; T.D. 9712, 80 FR 10589, Feb. 27, 2015]</p>
