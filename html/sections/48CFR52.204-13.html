                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 4.1105(b), use the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit  number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B;) to identify unique  business entities, which is used as the identification number for  Federal Contractors.</p><p class="depth0">Data Universal Numbering System + 4 (DUNS + 4) number means the DUNS  number assigned by D&B; plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by  a business concern. (D&B;   has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character  suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to  establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic  Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the  same concern.</p><p class="depth0">Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including  the DUNS number or the DUNS + 4 number, the Contractor and Government  Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the  SAM database;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions,  Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of  the registration in the SAM database;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to  include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to  provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the  SAM registration process; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p><p class="depth0">System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government  repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee  information and the centralized Government system for certain  contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It  includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for  the conduct of business with the Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and  certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal  contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial  and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness  of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting  from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To  remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration,  the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from  the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information  in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions  of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed  contractual document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a Contractor has legally changed its business name,  doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the  contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the  contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding  novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor  shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one  business day's written notification of its intention to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Change the name in the SAM database;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the  responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the  notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed  name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at  paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly  executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that  shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the  contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the  meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic  funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT  payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to  reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR  subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately  registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM  record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an  ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be  incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of  Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained  with Dun & Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The  Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the  Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate  modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change  in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be  accomplished. Dun & Bradstreet may be contacted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the  Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet  at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If located outside the United States, by contacting the local  Dun and Bradstreet office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contractors may obtain additional information on registration  and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.
