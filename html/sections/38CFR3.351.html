                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section sets forth criteria for determining whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increased pension is payable to a veteran by reason of need for aid and

attendance or by reason of being housebound.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521(d), (e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increased compensation is payable to a veteran by reason of the veteran's spouse being in need of aid and attendance.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1115(1)(E))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Increased dependency and indemnity compensation is payable to a surviving spouse or parent by reason of being in need of aid and attendance.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(c), 1315(h))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Increased dependency and indemnity compensation is payable to a surviving spouse who is not in need of aid and attendance but is housebound.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(d))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Increased pension is payable to a surviving spouse by reason of need for aid and attendance, or if not in need of aid and attendance, by reason of being housebound.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1541(d), (e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Increased death compensation is payable to a surviving spouse by reason of being in need of aid and attendance.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1122)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aid and attendance; need. Need for aid and attendance means helplessness or being so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person. The criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section will be applied in determining whether such need exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Aid and attendance; criteria. The veteran, spouse, surviving spouse or parent will be considered in need of regular aid and attendance if he or she:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under the criteria set forth in Sec.  3.352(a).

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(b))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Housebound, or permanent and total plus 60 percent; disability pension. The rate of pension payable to a veteran who is entitled to pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521 and who is not in need of regular aid and attendance shall be as prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521(e) if, in addition to having a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (not including ratings based upon unemployability under Sec.  4.17 of this chapter) the veteran:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the permanent disability rated as 100 percent disabling and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is ``permanently housebound'' by reason of disability or disabilities. This requirement is met when the veteran is substantially confined to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical area, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(c), 1521(e))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Housebound; dependency and indemnity compensation. The monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation payable to a surviving spouse who does not qualify for increased dependency and indemnity compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1311(c) based on need for regular aid and attendance shall be increased by the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1311(d) if the surviving spouse is permanently housebound by reason of disability. The ``permanently housebound'' requirement is met when the surviving spouse is substantially confined to his or her home (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will

remain throughout the surviving spouse's lifetime.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(d))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Housebound; improved pension; death. The annual rate of death pension payable to a surviving spouse who does not qualify for an annual rate of death pension payable under Sec.  3.23(a)(6) based on need for aid and attendance shall be as set forth in Sec.  3.23(a)(7) if the surviving spouse is permanently housebound by reason of disability. The ``permanently housebound'' requirement is met when the surviving spouse is substantially confined to his or her home (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout the surviving spouse's lifetime.
