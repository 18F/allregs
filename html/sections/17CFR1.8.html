Any person may submit a request to the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide a joint interpretation of whether a particular agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A swap, as that term is defined in section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A security-based swap, as that term is defined in section 1a(42) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A mixed swap, as that term is defined in section 1a(47)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Request process. In making a request pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the requesting person must provide the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All material information regarding the terms of the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the economic characteristics and purpose of the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requesting person's determination as to whether the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) should be characterized as a swap, a security-based swap, or both, (i.e., a mixed swap), including the basis for such determination; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Such other information as may be requested by the Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Request withdrawal. A person may withdraw a request made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section at any time prior to the issuance of a joint interpretation or joint proposed rule by the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to the request; provided, however, that notwithstanding such withdrawal, the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide a joint interpretation of whether the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) is a swap, a security-based swap, or both (i.e., a mixed swap).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Request by the Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the absence of a request for a joint interpretation under paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission receives a proposal to list, trade, or clear an agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that raises questions as to the appropriate characterization of such agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) as a swap, a security-based swap, or both (i.e., a mixed swap), the Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission, as applicable, promptly shall notify the other of the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or their Chairmen jointly, may submit a request for a joint interpretation as described in paragraph (a) of this section; such submission shall be made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and may be withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Timeframe for joint interpretation. (1) If the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission determine to issue a joint interpretation as described in paragraph (a) of this section, such joint interpretation shall be issued within 120 days after receipt of a complete submission requesting a joint interpretation under paragraph (a) or (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission shall consult with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to issuing any joint interpretation as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission seek public comment with respect to a joint interpretation regarding an agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof), the 120-day period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed during the pendency of the comment period, but shall recommence with the business day after the public comment period ends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this section shall require the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue any joint interpretation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission do not issue a joint interpretation within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(3) of this section, each of the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission shall publicly provide the reasons for not issuing such a joint interpretation within the applicable timeframes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Joint proposed rule. (1) Rather than issue a joint interpretation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission may issue a joint proposed rule, in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to further define one or more of the terms swap, security-based swap, or mixed swap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A joint proposed rule described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be issued within the timeframe for issuing a joint interpretation set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
