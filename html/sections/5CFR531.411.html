                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When a within-grade increase has been withheld, an agency may, at  any time thereafter, prepare a new rating of record for the employee and  grant the within-grade increase when it determines that he or she has  demonstrated sustained performance at an acceptable level of competence.  However, the agency shall determine whether the employee's performance  is at an acceptable level of competence after no more than 52 calendar  weeks following the original eligibility date for the within-grade  increase and, for as long as the within-grade increase continues to be  denied, determinations will be made after no longer than each 52  calendar weeks.
