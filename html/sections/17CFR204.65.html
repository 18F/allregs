                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Unless the Commission receives information that the Commission  believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the  Commission will send, by first class mail, a withholding order to the  debtor's employer within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely  request for a hearing (i.e., within 15 business days after the mailing  of the notice of the   Commission's intent to seek garnishment) or, if a timely request for a  hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a decision to issue  a withholding order becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form  prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Commission's  letterhead, and signed by the Chairperson or his or her delegatee. The  order will contain the information necessary for the employer to comply  with the withholding order. This information includes the debtor's name,  address, and social security number, as well as instructions for  withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Commission will keep a copy of the certificate of service  indicating the date of mailing of the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certification by employer. Along with the withholding order, the  Commission will send to the employer a certification in a form  prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete  and return the certification to the Commission within the time frame  prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will  address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status  and disposable pay available for withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amounts withheld. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After receipt of the garnishment order  issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable  pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of  garnishment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of  this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the  debtor's disposable pay; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on  Garnishment). The amount set forth at U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by  which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty  times the minimum wage See 29 CFR 870.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with  priority, the following shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders  issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under  paragraph (e)(2) of this section and shall have priority over other  withholding orders which are served later in time. However, withholding  orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders  issued under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a  withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order  issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family  support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld  pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the  amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a debtor owes more than one debt to the Commission, the  Commission may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount  garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the  amount set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) and  (e)(3) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the  debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The employer shall promptly pay to the Commission all amounts  withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and  disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's  earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits  execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any  assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or  order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the  debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives  notification from the   Commission to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall  indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is  required to commence wage withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exclusions from garnishment. The Commission will not garnish the  wages of a debtor it knows has been involuntarily separated from  employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at  least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing the Commission  of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from  employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Financial hardship. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A debtor whose wages are subject to a  wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a  review by the Commission of the amount garnished, based on materially  changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic  illness which result in financial hardship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A debtor requesting a review under this section shall submit the  basis for claiming that the current amount of garnishment results in a  financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a financial hardship is found, the Commission will downwardly  adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the  Commission, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial  condition. The Commission will notify the employer of any adjustments to  the amounts to be withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Ending garnishment. (2) Once the Commission has fully recovered  the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and  administrative costs consistent with the Federal Claims Collection  Standards (31 CFR 901.9), the Commission will send the debtor's employer  notification to discontinue wage withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least annually, the Commission will review its debtors'  accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts  that have been paid in full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Actions prohibited by the employer. The Debt Collection Act  prohibits an employer from discharging, refusing to employ, or taking  disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a  withholding order under this section (31 U.S.C. 3720D(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Refunds. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a hearing official determines that a debt is not  legally due and owing to the United States, the Commission shall  promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage  garnishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this  section shall not bear interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Right of action. The Commission may sue any employer for any  amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable  to an employee in accordance with this section. However, a suit will not  be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a  particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid  expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. For purposes of  this section, ``termination of the collection action'' occurs when the  agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the Federal  Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 903.1-903.5) or other applicable  standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have  been deemed to occur if the Commission has not received any payments to  satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to  garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.</p>
