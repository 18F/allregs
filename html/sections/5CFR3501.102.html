                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each of the following ten components of the Department is  designated as an agency separate from each of the other nine listed  components and, for employees of that component, as an agency distinct  from the remainder of the Department, for purposes of the regulations in  subpart B of 5 CFR 2635 governing gifts from outside sources, 5 CFR  2635.807 governing teaching, speaking and writing, and Sec. 3501.105  requiring prior approval of outside employment. However, the following  ten components are not deemed to be separate agencies for purposes of  applying any provision of 5 CFR part 2635 or this part to employees of  the remainder of the Department:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bureau of Indian Affairs, including the Office of Indian  Education Programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bureau of Land Management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bureau of Reclamation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minerals Management Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> National Indian Gaming Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> National Park Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> U.S. Geological Survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employees in components not listed in paragraph (a) of this  section (including employees within the immediate office of each  Assistant Secretary) are employees of the remainder of the Department,  which for those employees shall include the components designated in  this section as well as those parts of the Department not designated in  this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A company that conducts activities regulated by the  Bureau of Land Management would not be a prohibited source of gifts for  an employee of the National Park Service (NPS), unless that company  seeks official action by the NPS; does business or seeks to do business  with the NPS; conducts activities that are regulated by the NPS; or has  interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or  nonperformance of that employee's official duties.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A paralegal who works part-time in the Office of the  Solicitor wants to take an additional part-time job with a private  company that does business with the U.S. Geological Survey. The company  is a prohibited source for the paralegal, since the company does  business with a component of the Department from which his component has  not been listed as separate in Sec. 3501.102(a). The paralegal must  obtain prior approval for the outside employment, because Sec. 3501.105  requires employees to obtain such approval before engaging in outside  employment with a prohibited source.</p>
