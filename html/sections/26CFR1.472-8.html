                                Sec. 1.472-8  Dollar-value method of pricing LIFO inventories.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election to use dollar-value method. Any taxpayer may elect to  determine the cost of his LIFO inventories under the so-called ``dollar- value'' LIFO method, provided such method is used consistently and  clearly reflects the income of the taxpayer in accordance with the rules  of this section. The dollar-value method of valuing LIFO inventories is  a method of determining cost by using ``base-year'' cost expressed in  terms of total dollars rather than the quantity and price of specific  goods as the unit of measurement. Under such method the goods contained  in the inventory are grouped into a pool or pools as described in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The term ``base-year cost'' is  the aggregate of the cost (determined as of the beginning of the taxable  year for which the LIFO method is first adopted, i.e., the base date) of  all items in a pool. The taxable year for which the LIFO method is first  adopted with respect to any item in the pool is the ``base year'' for  that pool, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.  Liquidations and increments of items contained in the pool shall be  reflected only in terms of a net liquidation or increment for the pool  as a whole. Fluctuations may occur in   quantities of various items within the pool, new items which properly  fall within the pool may be added, and old items may disappear from the  pool, all without necessarily effecting a change in the dollar value of  the pool as a whole. An increment in the LIFO inventory occurs when the  end of the year inventory for any pool expressed in terms of base-year  cost is in excess of the beginning of the year inventory for that pool  expressed in terms of base-year cost. In determining the inventory value  for a pool, the increment, if any, is adjusted for changing unit costs  or values by reference to a percentage, relative to base-year-cost,  determined for the pool as a whole. See paragraph (e) of this section.  See also paragraph (f) of this section for rules relating to the change  to the dollar-value LIFO method from another LIFO method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Principles for establishing pools of manufacturers and  processors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Natural business unit pools. A pool shall consist of all  items entering into the entire inventory investment for a natural  business unit of a business enterprise, unless the taxpayer elects to  use the multiple pooling method provided in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph. Thus, if a business enterprise is composed of only one  natural business unit, one pool shall be used for all of its  inventories, including raw materials, goods in process, and finished  goods. If, however, a business enterprise is actually composed of more  than one natural business unit, more than one pool is required. Where  similar types of goods are inventoried in two or more natural business  units of the taxpayer, the Commissioner may apportion or allocate such  goods among the various natural business units, if he determines that  such apportionment or allocation is necessary in order to clearly  reflect the income of such taxpayer. Where a manufacturer or processor  is also engaged in the wholesaling or retailing of goods purchased from  others, any pooling of the LIFO inventory of such purchased goods for  the wholesaling or retailing operations shall be determined in  accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of natural business unit. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether an enterprise  is composed of more than one natural business unit is a matter of fact  to be determined from all the circumstances. The natural business  divisions adopted by the taxpayer for internal management purposes, the  existence of separate and distinct production facilities and processes,  and the maintenance of separate profit and loss records with respect to  separate operations are important considerations in determining what is  a business unit, unless such divisions, facilities, or accounting  records are set up merely because of differences in geographical  location. In the case of a manufacturer or processor, a natural business  unit ordinarily consists of the entire productive activity of the  enterprise within one product line or within two or more related product  lines including (to the extent engaged in by the enterprise) the  obtaining of materials, the processing of materials, and the selling of  manufactured or processed goods. Thus, in the case of a manufacturer or  processor, the maintenance and operation of a raw material warehouse  does not generally constitute, of itself, a natural business unit. If  the taxpayer maintains and operates a supplier unit the production of  which is both sold to others and transferred to a different unit of the  taxpayer to be used as a component part of another product, the supplier  unit will ordinarily constitute a separate and distinct natural business  unit. Ordinarily, a processing plant would not in itself be considered a  natural business unit if the production of the plant, although saleable  at this stage, is not sold to others, but is transferred to another  plant of the enterprise, not operated as a separate division, for  further processing or incorporation into another product. On the other  hand, if the production of a manufacturing or processing plant is  transferred to a separate and distinct division of the taxpayer, which  constitutes a natural business unit, the supplier unit itself will  ordinarily be considered a natural business unit. However, the mere fact  that a portion of the production of a manufacturing or processing plant  may be sold to others at a certain stage of processing with the  remainder of the   production being further processed or incorporated into another product  will not of itself be determinative that the activities devoted to the  production of the portion sold constitute a separate business unit.  Where a manufacturer or processor is also engaged in the wholesaling or  retailing of goods purchased from others, the wholesaling or retailing  operations with respect to such purchased goods shall not be considered  a part of any manufacturing or processing unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A corporation manufactures, in one division, automatic  clothes washers and driers of both commercial and domestic grade as well  as electric ranges, mangles, and dishwashers. The corporation  manufactures, in another division, radios and television sets. The  manufacturing facilities and processes used in manufacturing the radios  and television sets are distinct from those used in manufacturing the  automatic clothes washers, etc. Under these circumstances, the  enterprise would consist of two business units and two pools would be  appropriate, one consisting of all of the LIFO inventories entering into  the manufacture of clothes washers and driers, electric ranges, mangles,  and dishwashers and the other consisting of all of the LIFO inventories  entering into the production of radio and television sets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A taxpayer produces plastics in one of its plants.  Substantial amounts of the production are sold as plastics. The  remainder of the production is shipped to a second plant of the taxpayer  for the production of plastic toys which are sold to customers. The  taxpayer operates his plastics plant and toy plant as separate  divisions. Because of the different product lines and the separate  divisions the taxpayer has two natural business units.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A taxpayer is engaged in the manufacture of paper. At one  stage of processing, uncoated paper is produced. Substantial amounts of  uncoated paper are sold at this stage of processing. The remainder of  the uncoated paper is transferred to the taxpayer's finishing mill where  coated paper is produced and sold. This taxpayer has only one natural  business unit since coated and uncoated paper are within the same  product line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiple pools--(i) Principles for establishing multiple pools.  (a) A taxpayer may elect to establish multiple pools for inventory items  which are not within a natural business unit as to which the taxpayer  has adopted the natural business unit method of pooling as provided in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Each such pool shall ordinarily  consist of a group of inventory items which are substantially similar.  In determining whether such similarity exists, consideration shall be  given to all the facts and circumstances. The formulation of detailed  rules for selection of pools applicable to all taxpayers is not  feasible. Important considerations to be taken into account include, for  example, whether there is substantial similarity in the types of raw  materials used or in the processing operations applied; whether the raw  materials used are readily interchangeable; whether there is similarity  in the use of the products; whether the groupings are consistently  followed for purposes of internal accounting and management; and whether  the groupings follow customary business practice in the taxpayer's  industry. The selection of pools in each case must also take into  consideration such factors as the nature of the inventory items subject  to the dollar-value LIFO method and the significance of such items to  the taxpayer's business operations. Where similar types of goods are  inventoried in natural business units and multiple pools of the  taxpayer, the Commissioner may apportion or allocate such goods among  the natural business units and the multiple pools, if he determines that  such apportionment or allocation is necessary in order to clearly  reflect the income of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Raw materials which are substantially similar shall be pooled  together in accordance with the principles of this subparagraph.  However, inventories of raw or unprocessed materials of an unlike nature  may not be placed into one pool, even though such materials become part  of otherwise identical finished products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Finished goods and goods-in-process in the inventory shall be  placed into pools classified by major classes or types of goods. The  same class or type of finished goods and goods-in-process shall  ordinarily be included in the same pool. Where the material content of a  class of finished goods and goods-in-process included in a pool has been  changed, for example, to conform   with current trends in an industry, a separate pool of finished goods  and goods-in-process will not ordinarily be required unless the change  in material content results in a substantial change in the finished  goods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The requirement that pools be established by major types of  materials or major classes of goods is not to be construed so as to  preclude the establishment of a miscellaneous pool. Since a taxpayer may  elect the dollar-value LIFO method with respect to all or any designated  goods in his inventory, there may be a number of such inventory items  covered in the election. A miscellaneous pool shall consist only of  items which are relatively insignificant in dollar value by comparison  with other inventory items in the particular trade or business and which  are not properly includible as part of another pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Raw materials content pools. The dollar-value method of pricing  LIFO inventories may be used in conjunction with the raw materials  content method authorized in Sec. 1.472-1. Raw materials (including the  raw material content of finished goods and goods-in-process) which are  substantially similar shall be pooled together in accordance with the  principles of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. However, inventories  of materials of an unlike nature may not be placed into one pool, even  though such materials become part of otherwise identical finished  products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> may combine a miscellaneous IPIC pool  that comprises less than 5 percent of the total current-year cost of all  dollar-value pools with the largest IPIC pool. Each of these 5 percent  rules is a method of accounting. A taxpayer may not change to, or cease  using, either 5 percent rule without obtaining the Commissioner's prior  consent. Whether a specific IPIC pool or the miscellaneous IPIC pool  satisfies the applicable 5 percent rule must be determined in the year  of adoption or year of change (whichever is applicable) and redetermined  every third taxable year. Any change in pooling required or permitted as  a result of a 5 percent rule is a change in method of accounting. A  taxpayer must secure the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to  Sec. 1.446-1(e) before combining or separating pools and must combine or  separate its IPIC pools in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Principles for establishing pools for wholesalers, retailers,  etc--(1) In general. Items of inventory in the hands of wholesalers,  retailers, jobbers, and distributors shall be placed into pools by major  lines, types, or classes of goods. In determining such groupings,  customary business classifications of the particular trade in which the  taxpayer is engaged is an important consideration. An example of such  customary business classification is the department in the department  store. In such case, practices are relatively uniform throughout the  trade, and departmental grouping is peculiarly adapted to the customs  and needs of the business. However, in appropriate cases, the principles  set forth in paragraphs (b) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2) of this section, relating to  pooling by natural business units, may be used, with permission of the  Commissioner, by wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, or distributors. Where  a wholesaler or retailer is also engaged in the manufacturing or  processing of goods, the pooling of the LIFO inventory for the  manufacturing or processing operations shall be determined   in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of appropriateness of pools. Whether the number  and the composition of the pools used by the taxpayer is appropriate, as  well as the propriety of all computations incidental to the use of such  pools, will be determined in connection with the examination of the  taxpayer's income tax returns. Adequate records must be maintained to  support the base-year unit cost as well as the current-year unit cost  for all items priced on the dollar-value LIFO inventory method,  regardless of the method authorized by paragraph (e) of this section  which is used in computing the LIFO value of the dollar-value pool. The  pool or pools selected must be used for the year of adoption and for all  subsequent taxable years unless a change is required by the Commissioner  in order to clearly reflect income, or unless permission to change is  granted by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.446- 1. However, see paragraph (h) of this section for authorization to  change the method of pooling in certain specified cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Methods of computation of the LIFO value of a dollar-value  pool--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Methods authorized. A taxpayer may ordinarily use only the so- called ``double-extension'' method for computing the base-year and  current-year cost of a dollar-value inventory pool. Where the use of the  double-extension method is impractical, because of technological  changes, the extensive variety of items, or extreme fluctuations in the  variety of the items, in a dollar-value pool, the taxpayer may use an  index method for computing all or part of the LIFO value of the pool. An  index may be computed by double-extending a representative portion of  the inventory in a pool or by the use of other sound and   consistent statistical methods. The index used must be appropriate to  the inventory pool to which it is to be applied. The appropriateness of  the method of computing the index and the accuracy, reliability, and  suitability of the use of such index must be demonstrated to the  satisfaction of the district director in connection with the examination  of the taxpayer's income tax returns. The use of any so-called ``link- chain'' method will be approved for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1960, only in those cases where the taxpayer can  demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director that the use of  either an index method or the double-extension method would be  impractical or unsuitable in view of the nature of the pool. A taxpayer  using either an index or link-chain method shall attach to his income  tax return for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960,  for which the index or link-chain method is used, a statement describing  the particular link-chain method or the method used in computing the  index. The statement shall be in sufficient detail to facilitate the  determination as to whether the method used meets the standards set  forth in this subparagraph. In addition, a copy of the statement shall  be filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: T:R,  Washington, D.C. 20224. The taxpayer shall submit such other information  as may be requested with respect to such index or link-chain method.  Adequate records must be maintained by the taxpayer to support the  appropriateness, accuracy, and reliability of an index or link-chain  method. A taxpayer may request the Commissioner to approve the  appropriateness of an index or link-chain method for the first taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1960, for which it is used. Such  request must be submitted within 90 days after the beginning of the  first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, in which the  taxpayer desires to use the index or link-chain method, or on or before  May 1, 1961, whichever is later. A taxpayer entitled to use the retail  method of pricing LIFO inventories authorized by paragraph (k) of  Sec. 1.472-1 may use retail price indexes prepared by the United States  Bureau of Labor Statistics. Any method of computing the LIFO value of a  dollar-value pool must be used for the year of adoption and all  subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the  Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.446-1 to use a  different method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Double-extension method. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the double-extension method  the quantity of each item in the inventory pool at the close of the  taxable year is extended at both base-year unit cost and current-year  unit cost. The respective extensions at the two costs are then each  totaled. The first total gives the amount of the current inventory in  terms of base-year cost and the second total gives the amount of such  inventory in terms of current-year cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total current-year cost of items making up a pool may be  determined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By reference to the actual cost of the goods most recently  purchased or produced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By reference to the actual cost of the goods purchased or  produced during the taxable year in the order of acquisition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> By application of an average unit cost equal to the aggregate  cost of all of the goods purchased or produced throughout the taxable  year divided by the total number of units so purchased or produced; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Pursuant to any other proper method which, in the opinion of the  Commissioner, clearly reflects income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under the double-extension method a base-year unit cost must  be ascertained for each item entering a pool for the first time  subsequent to the beginning of the base year. In such a case, the base- year unit cost of the entering item shall be the current-year cost of  that item unless the taxpayer is able to reconstruct or otherwise  establish a different cost. If the entering item is a product or raw  material not in existence on the base date, its cost may be  reconstructed, that is, the taxpayer using reasonable means may  determine what the cost of the item would have been had it been in  existence in the base year. If the item was in existence on the base  date but not stocked by the taxpayer, he may establish, by using  available data or records, what the cost of the item would have   been to the taxpayer had he stocked the item. If the base-year unit cost  of the entering item is either reconstructed or otherwise established to  the satisfaction of the Commissioner, such cost may be used as the base- year unit cost in applying the double-extension method. If the taxpayer  does not reconstruct or establish to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner a base-year unit cost, but does reconstruct or establish to  the satisfaction of the Commissioner the cost of the item at some year  subsequent to the base year, he may use the earliest cost which he does  reconstruct or establish as the base-year unit cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To determine whether there is an increment or liquidation in a  pool for a particular taxable year, the end of the year inventory of the  pool expressed in terms of base-year cost is compared with the beginning  of the year inventory of the pool expressed in terms of base-year cost.  When the end of the year inventory of the pool is in excess of the  beginning of the year inventory of the pool an increment occurs in the  pool for that year. If there is an increment for the taxable year, the  ratio of the total current-year cost of the pool to the total base-year  cost of the pool must be computed. This ratio when multiplied by the  amount of the increment measured in terms of base-year cost gives the  LIFO value of such increment. The LIFO value of each such increment is  hereinafter referred to in this section as the ``layer of increment''  and must be separately accounted for and a record thereof maintained as  a separate layer of the pool, and may not be combined with a layer of  increment occurring in a different year. On the other hand, when the end  of the year inventory of the pool is less than the beginning of the year  inventory of the pool, a liquidation occurs in the pool for that year.  Such liquidation is to be reflected by reducing the most recent layer of  increment by the excess of the beginning of the year inventory over the  end of the year inventory of the pool. However, if the amount of the  liquidation exceeds the amount of the most recent layer of increment,  the preceding layers of increment in reverse chronological order are to  be successively reduced by the amount of such excess until all the  excess is absorbed. The base-year inventory is to be reduced by  liquidation only to the extent that the aggregate of all liquidation  exceeds the aggregate of all layers of increment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The following examples illustrate inventories under the double- extension the computation of the LIFO value of method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of this section.

The inventory price index computation method provided by this paragraph  (e)(3) (IPIC method) is an elective method of determining the LIFO value  of a dollar-value pool using consumer or producer price indexes  published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A  taxpayer using the IPIC method must compute a separate inventory price  index (IPI) for each dollar-value pool. This IPI is used to convert the  total current-year cost of the items in a dollar-value pool to base-year  cost in order to determine whether there is an increment or liquidation  in terms of base-year cost and, if there is an increment, to determine  the LIFO inventory value of the current year's layer of increment  (layer). Using one IPI to compute the base-year cost of a dollar-value  pool for the current taxable year and using a different IPI to compute  the LIFO inventory value of the current taxable year's layer is not  permitted under the IPIC method. The IPIC method will be accepted by the  Commissioner as an appropriate method of computing an index, and the use  of that index to compute the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool will be  accepted as accurate, reliable, and suitable. The appropriateness of a  taxpayer's computation of an IPI, which includes all the steps described  in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, will be determined in  connection with an examination of the taxpayer's federal income tax  return. A taxpayer using the IPIC method may elect to establish   dollar-value pools according to the special rules in paragraphs (b)(4)  and (c)(2) of this section or the general rules in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section. Taxpayers eligible to use the IPIC method are  described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. The manner in which  an IPI is computed is described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this  section. Rules relating to the adoption of, or change to, the IPIC  method are in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or in other published guidance, a taxpayer that  elects to use the IPIC method for a specific trade or business must use  that method to account for all items of dollar-value LIFO inventory. A  taxpayer that uses the retail price indexes computed by the BLS and  published in ``Department Store Inventory Price Indexes'' (available  from the BLS by calling (202) 606-6325 and entering document code 2415)  may elect to use the IPIC method for items that do not fall within any  of the major groups listed in ``Department Store Inventory Price  Indexes.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of an inventory price index--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The  computation of an IPI for a dollar-value pool requires the following  four steps, which are described in more detail in this paragraph  (e)(3)(iii): First, selection of a BLS table and an appropriate month;  second, assignment of items in a dollar-value pool to BLS categories  (selected BLS categories); third, computation of category inflation  indexes for selected BLS categories; and fourth, computation of the IPI.  A taxpayer may compute the IPI for each dollar-value pool using either  the double-extension method (double-extension IPIC method) or the link- chain method (link-chain IPIC method), without regard to whether the use  of a double-extension method is impractical or unsuitable. The use of  either the double-extension IPIC method or the link-chain IPIC method is  a method of accounting, and the adopted method must be applied  consistently to all dollar-value pools within a trade or business  accounted for under the IPIC method. A taxpayer that wants to change  from the double-extension IPIC method to the link-chain IPIC method, or  vice versa, must secure the consent of the Commissioner under  Sec. 1.446-1(e). This change must be made with a new base year as  described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Selection of BLS table and appropriate month--(1) In general.  Under the IPIC method, an IPI is computed using the consumer or producer  price indexes for certain categories (BLS price indexes and BLS  categories, respectively) listed in the selected BLS table of the ``CPI  Detailed Report'' or the ``PPI Detailed Report'' for the appropriate  month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BLS table selection. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers,  jobbers, and distributors must select BLS price indexes from Table 6  (Producer price indexes and percent changes for commodity groupings and  individual items, not seasonally adjusted) of the ``PPI Detailed  Report'', unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that selecting BLS price  indexes from another table of the ``PPI Detailed Report'' is more  appropriate. Retailers may select BLS price indexes from either Table 3  (Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city  average, detailed expenditure categories) of the ``CPI Detailed Report''  or from Table 6 (or another more appropriate table) of the ``PPI  Detailed Report.'' The selection of a BLS table is a method of  accounting and must be used for the taxable year of adoption and all  subsequent years, unless the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent  under Sec. 1.446-1(e) to change its table selection. A taxpayer that  changes its BLS table must establish a new base year in the year of  change as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate month. In the case of a retailer using the retail  method, the appropriate month is the last month of the retailer's  taxable year. In the case of all other taxpayers, the appropriate month  is the month most consistent with the method used to determine the  current-year cost of the dollar-value pool under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of  this section and the taxpayer's history of inventory production or  purchases during the taxable year. A taxpayer not using the retail  method may annually   select an appropriate month for each dollar-value pool or make an  election on Form 970, ``Application to Use LIFO Inventory Method,'' to  use a representative appropriate month (representative month). An  election to use a representative month is a method of accounting and the  month elected must be used for the taxable year of the election and all  subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's  consent under Sec. 1.446-1(e) to change or revoke its election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Determining an appropriate month. A wholesaler of  seasonal goods timely files a Form 970, ``Application to Use LIFO  Inventory Method,'' for the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. The  taxpayer indicates elections to use the dollar-value LIFO method, to  determine the current-year cost using the earliest acquisitions method  in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(b) of this section, and to use  the IPIC method under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Although the  taxpayer purchases inventory items regularly throughout the year, the  items purchased vary according to the seasons. The seasonal items on  hand at December 31, 2001, are purchased between October and December.  Thus, based on the taxpayer's use of the earliest acquisitions method of  determining current-year cost and its experience with inventory  purchases, the appropriate month for the items represented in the ending  inventory at December 31, 2001, is October.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Electing a representative month. A retailer not using the  retail method timely files a Form 970, ``Application to Use LIFO  Inventory Method,'' for the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. The  taxpayer indicates elections to use the dollar-value LIFO method, the  most recent purchases method of determining current-year cost under  paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(a) of this section, the IPIC method under paragraph  (e)(3) of this section, and December as its representative month under  paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(3) of this section. The items in the taxpayer's  ending inventory are purchased fairly uniformly throughout the year,  with the first purchases normally occurring in January and the last  purchases normally occurring in December. The taxpayer's election to use  December as its representative month is permissible because the taxpayer  elected to use the most recent purchases method and the taxpayer's last  purchases of the taxable year normally occur during December, the last  month of the taxpayer's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Changing representative month. The facts are the same as  in Example 2, except the taxpayer files a Form 3115, ``Application for  Change in Accounting Method,'' requesting permission to change to the  earliest acquisitions method of determining current-year cost in  accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(b) of this section and to change  its representative month from December to January beginning with the  taxable year ending December 31, 2003. If the Commissioner consents to  the taxpayer's request to change to the earliest acquisitions method,  December will no longer be a permissible representative month for this  taxpayer because of the absence of a nexus between the earliest  acquisitions method, the month of December (the last month of the  taxpayer's taxable year), and the taxpayer's experience with inventory  purchases during the year. Thus, the Commissioner will permit the  taxpayer to change its representative month to January, the first month  of the taxpayer's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Changing representative month. The facts are the same as  in Example 2. In 2002, the taxpayer changes its annual accounting period  to a taxable year ending June 30, which requires the taxpayer to file a  return for the short taxable year beginning January 1, 2002, and ending  June 30, 2002. As a result, December is no longer a permissible  representative month because of the absence of a nexus between the most  recent purchases method, the month of December, and the taxpayer's  experience with inventory purchases during the year. The taxpayer should  file a Form 3115 requesting permission to change its representative  month from December to June beginning with the short taxable year ending  June 30, 2002. Because the taxpayer's last purchases of the taxable year  now will occur in June, the Commissioner will consent to the taxpayer's  request to change its representative month to June.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Changing representative month. The facts are the same as  in Example 2, except that the taxpayer elects to use January as its  representative month. The taxpayer timely files a Form 3115 requesting  permission to change its representative month from January to December  beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2003. January is not  a permissible representative month because of the absence of a nexus  between the most recent purchases method, the taxpayer's history of  inventory purchases, and the month of January, the first month in the  taxpayer's taxable year. Because December is a permissible  representative month, the Commissioner will permit the taxpayer to  change its representative month to December.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(2)</em> of this section, a  taxpayer must assign each item in a dollar-value pool to the   most-detailed BLS category of the selected BLS table that contains that  item. For example, in Table 6 of the ``PPI Detailed Report'' for a given  month, the commodity codes for the various BLS categories run from 2 to  8 digits, with the least-detailed BLS categories having a 2-digit code  and the most-detailed BLS categories usually (but not always) having an  8-digit code. For purposes of assigning items to the most-detailed BLS  category, manufacturers and processors must assign each raw material  item to the most-detailed PPI category that includes that raw material  and must assign each finished good item to the most-detailed PPI  category that includes that finished good. In addition, manufacturers  and processors must assign each work-in-process (WIP) item to the most- detailed PPI category that includes the finished good into which the  item will be manufactured or processed. For this purpose, finished good  means a salable item that the taxpayer regularly sells. For example, a  gasoline-engine manufacturer that also manufactures the pistons used in  those engines and regularly sells some of the pistons (e.g., to  retailers of replacement parts) must assign both finished pistons that  have not been affixed to an engine block and piston WIP items to the  most-detailed PPI category that includes pistons. Finished pistons that  have been affixed to an engine block must be assigned to the most- detailed PPI category that includes gasoline engines. In contrast, if  sales of these pistons occur infrequently, the taxpayer must assign both  finished pistons and piston WIP items to the most-detailed PPI category  that includes gasoline engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.  Under the 10 percent method, items are assigned to BLS categories using  a three-step procedure. First, when the current-year cost of a specific  item is 10 percent or more of the total current-year cost of the dollar- value pool, the taxpayer must assign that item to the most-detailed BLS  category that includes that item (10 percent BLS category). Any other  item that is includible in that 10 percent BLS category (other than an  item that qualifies for its own 10 percent BLS category under the  preceding sentence) must be assigned to that 10 percent BLS category.  Second, if one or more items have not been assigned to BLS categories in  the first step, the taxpayer must investigate successively less-detailed  BLS categories and assign the unassigned item(s) to the first BLS  category that contains unassigned items whose current-year cost, in the  aggregate, is 10 percent or more of the total current-year cost of the  dollar-value pool (also, 10 percent BLS categories). This step must be  repeated until all the items in the dollar-value pool have been included  in an appropriate 10 percent BLS category, the current-year cost of the  unassigned items, in the aggregate, is less than 10 percent of the total  current-year cost of the dollar-value pool, or the taxpayer determines  that a single BLS category is not appropriate for the aggregate of the  unassigned items. Third, if items in a dollar-value pool have not been  assigned to a 10 percent BLS category because the current-year cost of  those items, in the aggregate, is less than 10 percent of the total  current-year cost of the dollar-value pool, the taxpayer must assign  those items to the most-detailed BLS category that includes all those  items (also, a 10 percent category). On the other hand, if items in a  dollar-value pool have not been assigned to a 10 percent BLS category  because the taxpayer determines that a single BLS category is not  appropriate for the aggregate of those items, the taxpayer must assign  each of those items to a single miscellaneous BLS category created by  the taxpayer (also, a 10 percent category). In no event may a taxpayer  assign items in a dollar-value pool to a BLS category that is less  detailed than either the major groups of consumer goods described in  Table 3 of the monthly ``CPI Detailed Report'' or the major commodity  groups of producer goods described in Table 6 of the monthly ``PPI  Detailed Report.'' Principles similar to those described in paragraph   (e)(3)(iii)(C)(1) apply for purposes of assigning raw material, work-in- process, and finished good items to the most-detailed BLS category under  the 10 percent method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>, a category  inflation index reflects the inflation that occurs in the BLS price  indexes for a selected BLS category (or, if applicable, 10 percent BLS  category) during the relevant measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BLS price indexes. The BLS price indexes are the cumulative  indexes published in the selected BLS table for the appropriate month. A  taxpayer may elect to use either preliminary or final BLS price indexes  for the appropriate month, provided that the selected BLS price indexes  are used consistently. However, a taxpayer that elects to use final BLS  price indexes for the appropriate month must use preliminary BLS price  indexes for any taxable year for which the taxpayer files its original  federal income tax return before the BLS publishes final BLS price  indexes for the appropriate month. If a BLS price index for a most- detailed or 10 percent BLS category is not otherwise available for the  appropriate or representative month (but not because the BLS categories  in the BLS table have been revised), the taxpayer must use the BLS price  index for the next most-detailed BLS category that includes the specific  item(s) in the most-detailed or 10 percent BLS category. If a BLS price  index is not otherwise available for the appropriate or representative  month because the BLS categories in the BLS table have been revised, the  rules of paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(4) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Category inflation index--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(4) of this section (concerning compound  category inflation indexes) or (e)(3)(iii)(D)(5) of this section  (concerning category inflation indexes for certain 10 percent BLS  categories), a category inflation index for a selected BLS category (or,  if applicable, 10 percent BLS category) is computed under the rules of  this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Double-extension IPIC method. In the case of a taxpayer using  the double-extension IPIC method, the category inflation index for a BLS  category is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or  representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index  for the appropriate month of the taxable year preceding the base year  (base month). However, if the taxpayer did not have an opening inventory  in the year that its election to use the dollar-value LIFO method and  double-extension IPIC method became effective, the category inflation  index for a BLS category is the quotient of the BLS price index for the  appropriate or representative month of the current year divided by the  BLS price index for the month immediately preceding the month of the  taxpayer's first inventory production or purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Link-chain IPIC method. In the case of a taxpayer using the  link-chain IPIC method, the category inflation index for a BLS category  is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or  representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index  for the appropriate month   used for the immediately preceding taxable year. However, if the  taxpayer did not have an opening inventory in the year that its election  to use the dollar-value LIFO method and link-chain IPIC method became  effective, the category inflation index for a BLS category for the year  of election is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate  or representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price  index for the month immediately preceding the month of the taxpayer's  first inventory production or purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> and in  other similar circumstances. For example, in the case of a short taxable  year, the category inflation index should reflect the inflation that  occurs from the base month (in the case of the double-extension IPIC  method), or the appropriate or representative month used for the  preceding taxable year (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method), and  the appropriate month for the short taxable year. Similarly, if a  taxpayer using the link-chain IPIC method is granted consent to change  both its method of determining the current-year cost of a dollar-value  pool and its representative month, the category inflation index for the  year of change should reflect the inflation that occurs between the old  representative month used for the preceding taxable year and the new  representative month used for the year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Compound category inflation index for revised BLS categories or  price indexes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Periodically, the BLS revises a BLS table  to add one or more new BLS categories, eliminate one or more previously  reported BLS categories, or reset the base-year BLS price index of one  or more BLS categories. If the BLS has revised the applicable BLS table  for a taxable year, a taxpayer must compute the category inflation index  for each BLS category for which the taxpayer cannot compute a category  inflation index in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(3) of this  section (affected BLS category) using a reasonable method, provided the  method is used consistently for all affected BLS categories within a  particular taxable year. For example, if the BLS revised the CPI by  adding new BLS categories as of January 2001 and eliminating some  previously reported BLS categories as of December 2000, January 2002  would be the first month for which it would be possible to compute a  category inflation index for a 12-month period using the BLS price  indexes for any affected category. The compound category inflation index  described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(4)(ii) of this section is a  reasonable method of computing the category inflation index for an  affected BLS category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> to compute a compound  category inflation index for each affected BLS category represented in  the taxpayer's ending inventory. For this purpose, a compound category  inflation index is the product of the category inflation index for the  ``first portion'' multiplied by the corresponding category inflation  index for the ``second portion.'' The category inflation index for the  first portion must reflect the inflation that occurs between the end of  the base month (in the case of the double-extension IPIC method), or the  preceding year's appropriate or representative month (in the case of the  link-chain IPIC method), and the end of the last month covered by the  unrevised BLS table based on the old BLS category. The corresponding  category inflation index for the second portion must reflect the  inflation that occurs between the beginning of the first month covered  by the revised BLS table based on the new BLS category and the end of  the current year's appropriate or representative month. First, using the  revised BLS table for the current-year's appropriate or representative  month, the taxpayer assigns items in the dollar-value pool using its  method of assigning items to   BLS categories as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.  Second, for each affected BLS category represented in the ending  inventory, the taxpayer computes the category inflation index for the  second portion using this formula: [A/B], where A equals the BLS price  index for the current year's appropriate or representative month and B  equals the BLS price index for the last month covered by the unrevised  BLS table (as published for the first month of the revised BLS table).  Third, using the unrevised BLS table for the base month (in the case of  the double extension IPIC method) or the preceding year's appropriate or  representative month (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method), the  taxpayer assigns each of the items in the dollar-value pool using its  method of assigning items to BLS categories. Fourth, for each affected  BLS category represented in the ending inventory, the taxpayer computes  the category inflation index for the first portion using this formula:  [C/D], where C equals the BLS price index for the last month covered by  the unrevised BLS table (as published for the last month of the  unrevised BLS table) and D equals the BLS price index for the base month  (in the case of the double-extension IPIC method) or the preceding  year's appropriate or representative month (in the case of the link- chain IPIC method). Fifth, for each affected BLS category represented in  the ending inventory, the taxpayer computes the compound category  inflation index using this formula: [X*Y], where X equals the category  inflation index for the second portion, and Y equals the corresponding  category inflation index for the first portion. For the purpose of  computing the compound category inflation index for each affected BLS  category, the corresponding category inflation index for the first  portion is the category inflation index for the unrevised BLS category  that includes the specific inventory item(s) included in the revised BLS  category. If items included in a single revised BLS category had been  included in separate BLS categories before the revision of the BLS  table, the corresponding category inflation index for the first portion  is the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes for  these unrevised BLS categories. See paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E)(1) of this  section for a formula of the weighted harmonic mean. When computing this  weighted-average category inflation index, a taxpayer must use the  current-year costs (or in the case of a retailer using the retail  method, the retail selling prices) in ending inventory as the weights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(D)(4)</em>  for one or more affected BLS categories in a dollar-value pool. See  paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section for the procedures and  computations incident to establishing a new base year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A retailer, whose taxable  year ends January 31, elected to account for its inventories using the  dollar-value LIFO method and double-extension IPIC method (based on the  CPI), beginning with the taxable year ending January 31, 1997. The  taxpayer does not use the retail method, but elected to use January as  its representative month. On January 31, 1999, the taxpayer's only  dollar-value pool contains only two items--lemons and peaches. The total  current-year cost of these items is as follows: lemons, $40, and  peaches, $30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The CPI was revised in October of 1998 to eliminate the  ``Citrus fruits'' subcategory of ``Other fresh fruits.'' In addition,  the base-year BLS price index for ``Other fresh fruits'' was reset to  100.00 as of October 1, 1998. In relevant part, the January 1999 CPI  permits the assignment of both lemons and peaches to ``Other fresh  fruits.'' The January 1999 BLS price indexes for ``Citrus fruits'' and  ``Other fresh fruits'' are 96.6 and 105.6, respectively. In relevant  part, the September 1998 CPI permits the assignment of lemons to  ``Citrus fruits'' and peaches to ``Other fresh fruits.'' The September  1998 BLS price indexes for ``Citrus fruits'' and ``Other fresh fruits''  are 194.9 and 294.9, respectively, and the January 1997 BLS price  indexes for ``Citrus fruits'' and ``Other fresh fruits'' are 190.2 and  290.2, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(D)(4)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The taxpayer computes a compound category inflation index for  the two BLS categories that formerly included lemons and peaches.

[Weighted Arithmetic Mean = Sum of  (Weight x Category Inflation Index)]/Sum of Weights]. The appropriate  weight for each of the most-detailed BLS categories referenced in the  preceding sentence is the corresponding BLS weight. Currently, in  January of each year, the BLS publishes the BLS weights determined for  December of the preceding year. In the case of a taxpayer using the  double-extension IPIC method, the BLS weights for December of the  taxable year preceding the base year are to be used for all taxable  years. In the case of a taxpayer using the link-chain IPIC method, the  BLS weights for December of a given calendar year are to be used for  taxable years that end during the 12-month period that begins on July 1  of the following calendar year. However, if the BLS weights are not  published for all of the most-detailed BLS categories referenced above,  the taxpayer may use the current-year cost (or in the case of a retailer  using the retail method, the retail selling prices) of all items  assigned to a specific most-detailed BLS category as the appropriate  weight for that category, but must compute a weighted harmonic mean.

R is a retail  furniture merchant that does not use the retail method.

The total cost  of R's inventory on December 31, 2000, was $850,000. R elected to use  the dollar-value LIFO and double-extension IPIC methods for its taxable  year ending December 31, 2001. R does not elect to use the 10 percent  method described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(2) of this section. R  determines the current-year cost of the items using the actual cost of  the most recently purchased goods. R elected to pool its inventory based  on the major groups in Table 6 of the monthly ``PPI Detailed Report'' in  accordance with the special IPIC pooling rules of paragraph (b)(4) of  this section. All items in R's inventory fall within the 2-digit  commodity code   in Table 6 of the monthly ``PPI Detailed Report'' for ``furniture and  household durables.''

Thus, the LIFO value of R's total inventory at  the end of 2002 is $917,589.46 ($850,000.00 (opening inventory) +  $59,192.52 (2001 layer) + $8,396.94 (2002 layer)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Introduction.

In the case  of a taxpayer using a non-IPIC method to determine the LIFO value of  inventory, the layers previously determined under that method, if any,  and the LIFO values of those layers are retained if the taxpayer  voluntarily changes to the IPIC method. Instead of using the earliest  taxable year for which the taxpayer adopted the LIFO method for any  items in the dollar-value pool, the year of change is used as the new  base year for the purpose of determining the amount of increments and  liquidations, if any, for the year of change and subsequent taxable  years. The base-year cost of the layers in a dollar-value pool at the  beginning of the year of change must be restated in terms of new base- year cost using the year of change as the new base year and, if  applicable, the indexes for the previously determined layers must be  recomputed accordingly. The recomputed indexes will be used to determine  the LIFO value of subsequent liquidations. For purposes of computing an  IPI under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E) of this section, the IPI for the  immediately preceding year is 1.00. The new total base-year cost of the  items in a dollar-value pool for the purpose of determining future  increments and liquidations is equal to the total current-year cost of  the items in the dollar-value pool (determined using the   taxpayer's method of determining the total current-year cost of the  items in the dollar-value pool under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this  section).

The base-year cost of any layers in the dollar-value  pool, as determined after the transfer, must be recomputed accordingly.  See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section for an example of this  computation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions to which this paragraph (h) applies. The rules in  this paragraph (h) apply to a transaction in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferee determines its basis in the inventories, in whole  or in part, by reference to the basis of the inventories in the hands of  the transferor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor used the dollar-value LIFO method to account for  the transferred inventories;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transferee uses the dollar-value LIFO method to account  for the inventories in the year of the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The transaction is not described in section 381(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anti-avoidance rule. The rules in this paragraph (h) do not  apply to a transaction entered into with the principal purpose to avail  the transferee of a method of accounting that would be unavailable to  the transferor (or would be unavailable to the transferor without  securing consent from the Commissioner). In determining the principal  purpose of a transfer, consideration will be given to all of the facts  and circumstances. However, a transfer is deemed made with the principal  purpose to avail the transferee of a method of accounting that would be  unavailable to the transferor without securing consent from the  Commissioner if the transferor acquired inventory in a bargain purchase  within the five taxable years preceding the year of the transfer and  used a dollar-value LIFO method to account for that inventory that did  not treat the bargain purchase inventory and physically identical  inventory acquired at market prices as separate items. Inventory is  deemed acquired in a bargain purchase if the actual cost of the  inventory (or, if appropriate, the allocated cost of the inventory) was  less than or equal to 50 percent of the replacement cost of physically  identical inventory. Inventory is not considered acquired in a bargain  purchase if the actual cost of the inventory (or, if appropriate, the  allocated cost of the inventory) was greater than or equal to 75 percent  of the replacement cost of physically identical inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. The rules of this paragraph (h) are applicable  for transfers that occur during a taxable year ending on or after  December 31, 2001.
