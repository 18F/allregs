Individuals who will receive training are not specifically designated by the State Department. The United Nations is a covered entity based on Sec. 140.4(a)(1); Government D is a covered entity based on Sec. Sec. 140.4(b) and 140.7(b); Corporation E is not a covered entity under Sec. Sec. 140.4(b) and 140.7(b) because it has been designated to receive less than $100,000 in assistance (Sec. 140.3(c)(2)). Participant trainees are not covered individuals because they fall under the exception contained in Sec. 140.7(c) (see also Sec. 140.4(a)(2)).</p>
