                                Sec. 70.162  Levy and distraint on salary and wages.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of intent to levy. Levy may be made for any unpaid tax  only after the appropriate TTB officer has notified the taxpayer in  writing of the intent to levy. The notice must be given in person, left  at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, or be sent  by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address, no  less than 30 days before the day of levy. The notice of intent to levy  is in addition to, and may be given at the same time as, the notice and  demand described in Sec. 70.161 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Jeopardy. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a levy  if the appropriate TTB officer has made a finding under Sec.  70.161(a)(2) of this part that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuing effect of levy on salary or wages. A levy on salary  or wages is continuous from the time of the levy until the liability out  of which the levy arose is released under 26 U.S.C. 6343 and Sec.  70.167 of this part. For this purpose, the term ``salary or  wages''includes compensation for services paid in the form of fees,  commissions, bonuses, and similar items. The levy attaches to both  salary or wages earned but not yet paid at the time of the levy, and  salary or wages earned and becoming payable (or paid in the form of an  advance) subsequent to the date of the levy, until the levy is released  pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In general, salaries or wages  that are the subject of a continuing levy, if not exempt from levy under  26 U.S.C. 6334(a) (8) or (9), become payable to the officer who made the  levy as the payor would otherwise be obligated to pay over the money to  the taxpayer. For example, if the wage earner is paid on the Wednesday  following the close of each workweek, a levy made upon the taxpayer's  employer on any Monday would reach both the wages due for the prior  workweek and the wages for succeeding workweeks as such wages become  payable. In such a case the levy would be satisfied if the employer, on  the first Wednesday after the levy and on each Wednesday thereafter,  pays over to the officer who made the levy wages which would otherwise  be paid to the employee on such Wednesday, until the employer receives a  notice of release from levy described in paragraph (d) of this section.  See, however, Sec. 70.245(d) of this part for rules which permit a  delayed payment to the officer who made the levy in certain cases where  amounts payable to the taxpayer are exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C.  6334 (a)(9) and (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release and notice of release from levy. The officer who made  the levy will promptly release a continuing levy on salary or wages when  the conditions of 26 U.S.C. 6343 are met. The officer who made the levy  will also promptly notify the person upon whom the levy was made that it  has been released.  (26 U.S.C. 6331)</p>
