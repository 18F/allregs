                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chronic renal disease means the chronic, progressive, and  irreversible destruction of the nephron. It is exhibited by diminution  of renal function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cor pulmonale means heart disease, including hypertrophy of the  right ventricle, due to pulmonary hypertension secondary to fibrosis of  the lung.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designated time period means the period beginning on January 1,  1942, and ending on December 31, 1971.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employment as an ore transporter means employment involving the  transporting or hauling of uranium ore or vanadium-uranium ore from a  uranium mine or uranium mill, including the transportation or hauling of  ore from an ore buying station, ``upgrader,'' ``concentrator'' facility,  or pilot plant by means of truck, rail or barge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Employment for at least one year means employment for a total of  at least one year (12 consecutive or cumulative months).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fibrosis of the lung or pulmonary fibrosis means chronic  inflammation and scarring of the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli with  collagen deposition and progressive thickening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Kidney tubal (tubular) tissue injury means structural or  functional damage to the kidney tubules that results in renal disease  and dysfunction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)  certified ``B'' reader means a physician who is certified as such by  NIOSH.

For the  purposes of this Act, the claimant's exposure to the particulate matter  that led to the disease must have occurred during employment as an ore  transporter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Primary lung cancer means any physiological condition of the  lung, trachea, or bronchus that is recognized under that name or  nomenclature by the National Cancer Institute. The term includes in situ  lung cancers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Readily available documentation means documents in the  possession, custody, or control of the claimant or an immediate family  member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Primary renal cancer means any physiological condition of the  kidneys that is recognized under that name or nomenclature by the  National Cancer Institute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Silicosis means a pneumoconiosis due to the inhalation of the  dust of stone, sand, flint or other materials containing silicon  dioxide, characterized by the formation of pulmonary fibrotic changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Specified state means Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming,  South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho,   North Dakota, Oregon, or Texas. Additional states may be included,  provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A uranium mine was operated in such state at any time during the  period beginning on January 1, 1942, and ending on December 31, 1971;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The state submits an application to the Assistant Director  (specified in Sec. 79.70(a)) to include such state; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Assistant Director makes a determination to include such  state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Uranium mill means any milling operation involving the  processing of uranium ore or vanadium-uranium ore, including carbonate  plants and acid leach plants. The term applies to ore-buying stations  where ore was weighed and sampled prior to delivery to a mill for  processing; ``upgrader'' or ``concentrator'' facilities located at the  mill or at a remote location where uranium or vanadium-uranium ore was  processed prior to delivery to a mill; and pilot plants where uranium  ore or vanadium-uranium ore was processed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Uranium mine means any underground excavation, including ``dog  holes,'' as well as open-pit, strip, rim, surface, or other aboveground  mines, where uranium ore or vanadium-uranium ore was mined or otherwise  extracted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Written diagnosis by a physician means a written determination  of the nature of a disease made from a study of the signs and symptoms  of a disease that is based on a physical examination of the patient,  medical imaging or a chemical, microscopic, microbiologic, immunologic,  or pathologic study of physiologic and functional tests, secretions,  discharges, blood, or tissue. For purposes of satisfying the requirement  of a ``written diagnosis by a physician'' for living claimants specified  in Sec. 79.65, a physician submitting a written diagnosis of a  nonmalignant respiratory disease must be employed by the Indian Health  Service or the Department of Veterans Affairs or be board certified, and  must have a documented, ongoing physician-patient relationship with the  claimant. An ``ongoing physician-patient relationship'' can include  referrals made to specialists from a primary care provider for purposes  of diagnosis or treatment. ``Board certification'' requires, in addition  to physician licensing, the successful completion of a residency  training program and passage of a Board exam in a relevant field or  specialty. Relevant specialties include: family practice, internal  medicine, pathology, preventive medicine, radiology, surgery, and  thoracic surgery (and including subspecialties such as cardiovascular  disease, medical oncology, pulmonary disease) as listed by the American  Board of Medical Specialties.</p>
