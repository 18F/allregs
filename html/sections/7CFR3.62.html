                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by  Administrative Offset, Notice of Disclosure to Credit Reporting  Agencies, or Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Wage  Garnishment, or more than one of the above simultaneously, may request  administrative review of the agency's determination that the debt exists  and the amount of the debt. Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit  a written explanation of why the debtor disagrees and seeks review. The  request must be received by the creditor agency within 60 days of the  date of the notice in the case of a Notice of Intent to Collect by  Administrative Offset that includes referral to Treasury for offset  against other Federal payments including tax refunds and 30 days in the  case of all other notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In response, the creditor agency must notify the debtor in  writing whether the review will be by documentary review or by hearing.  An oral hearing is not necessary with respect to debt collection systems  in which a determination of indebtedness rarely involves issues of  credibility or veracity and the agency has determined that review of the  written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior  mistakes. The agency shall provide the debtor with a reasonable  opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration  of the debt and the agency determines that the question of the  indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence,  for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of  credibility or veracity. If the debtor requests a hearing, and the  creditor agency decides to conduct a documentary review, the agency must  notify the debtor of the reason why a hearing will not be granted. The  agency must also advise the debtor of the procedures to be used in  reviewing the documentary record, or of the date, location and  procedures to be used if review is by a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either  in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by  the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the  debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the  responsibility of the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official shall  notify the debtor of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date and time of a telephonic hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deadline for the submission of evidence for a documentary  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor  and the agency, evidenced in writing, any documentary review or hearing  will be conducted not less than 10 days and no more than 45 days after  receipt of the request for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor  and the agency, evidenced in writing, a documentary review or hearing  will be based on agency records plus other relevant documentary evidence  which may be submitted by the debtor within 10 days after the request  for review is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hearings. Hearings will be as informal as possible, and will  be conducted by a reviewing officer in a fair and expeditious manner.  The reviewing officer need not use the formal rules of evidence with  regard to the admissibility of evidence or the use of evidence once  admitted. However, clearly irrelevant material should not be admitted,  whether or not any party objects. Any party to the hearing may offer  exhibits, such as copies of financial records, telephone memoranda, or  agreements,   provided the opposing party is notified at least five days before the  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Burden of proof. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agency will have the burden of going  forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of  the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that  no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition,  the debtor may present evidence that repayment would cause a financial  hardship to the debtor or that collection of the debt may not be pursued  due to operation of law</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Witnesses must testify under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Debtors may represent themselves or may be represented at their  own expense by an attorney or other person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The substance of all significant matters discussed at the  hearing must be recorded. No official record or transcript of the  hearing need be created, but if a debtor requested that a transcript be  made, it will be at the debtor's expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear  at a hearing scheduled pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section will  be deemed as not having timely filed a request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within no more than 30 days after the hearing or receipt of  documentation for the documentary review, the reviewing officer will  issue a written decision to the debtor and the agency, including the  supporting rationale for the decision. The deadline for issuance of the  decision may be extended by the reviewing officer for good cause for no  more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written decision shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A summary of the facts presented;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Resolution of any significant procedural matter which was in  dispute before or during the hearing or documentary review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reviewing officer's decision constitutes final agency action  for purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act  (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) as to the following issues:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All issues of fact relating to the basis of the debt (including  the existence of the debt and the propriety of administrative offset),  in cases where the debtor previously had not been afforded due process;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The existence of the debt and the propriety of administrative  offset, in cases where the debtor previously had been afforded due  process as to issues of fact relating to the basis of the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The reviewing officer will promptly distribute copies of the  decision to the USDA CFO, the agency CFO (if any), the agency debt  management officer, the debtor, and the debtor's representative, if any.</p>
