                                Sec. 2509.75-6  Interpretive bulletin relating to section 408(c)(2)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Department of Labor today announced guidelines for determining  when a party in interest with respect to an employee benefit plan may  receive an advance for expenses to be incurred on behalf of the plan  without engaging in a transaction prohibited by section 406 of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. That section prohibits,  among other things, any lending of money from a plan to a party in  interest, or transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in  interest of any assets of the plan, as well as any act whereby a  fiduciary deals with the assets of a plan in his own interest or for his  own account.</p><p class="depth0">However, section 408(c)(2) of the Act provides that nothing in  section 406 of the Act shall be construed to prohibit the reimbursement  by a plan of expenses properly and actually incurred by a fiduciary in  the performance of his duties with the plan. Questions have arisen under  section 408(c)(2) of the Act as to whether a plan may reimburse a party  in interest in the performance of his duties with the plan and as to  whether a plan might make an advance to a fiduciary or other party in  interest for expenses to be incurred in the future.</p><p class="depth0">The Department of Labor views the relevant provisions of section  408(c)(2) as clarifying the scope of section 406 so as to permit  reimbursement of fiduciaries for expenses incurred in the performance of  their duties with a plan. Similarly, consistent with section 408(c)(2),  section 406 is construed to permit the reimbursement by the plan of  expenses properly and actually incurred by a party in interest in the  performance of his duties with the plan.</p><p class="depth0">If a plan makes an advance to a fiduciary or other party in interest  to cover expenses to be properly and actually incurred by such person in  the performance of his duties with the plan, a prohibited transaction  within the meaning of section 406 shall not occur when the plan makes  the advance if--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The amount of such advance is reasonable with respect to the  amount of the expense which is likely to be properly and actually  incurred in the immediate future (such as during the next month), and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The party in interest accounts to the plan at the end of the  period covered by the advance for the expenses actually incurred  (whether computed on the basis of actual expenses incurred or on the  basis of actual transportation costs plus a reasonable per diem  allowance, where appropriate).</p><p class="depth2">It should be noted, however, that despite the reasonableness of the  amount of the advance and of the expenses underlying it, the question of  whether incurring such expenses   was prudent, and thus whether the advance was for reasonable expenses,  is to be judged pursuant to section 404 of the Act (relating to  fiduciary responsibilities).
