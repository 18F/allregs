When alternative models and variables have been employed, a  record shall be kept of these alternative studies, so as to be available  upon request. In the case of experimental analyses, a clear and complete  description of the experimental design shall be set forth, including a  specification of the controlled conditions and how the controls were  realized. In addition, the methods of making observations and the  adjustments, if any, to observed data shall be described. In the case of  every kind of statistical study, the following items shall be set forth  clearly: The formulas used for statistical estimates, standard errors  and test statistics, the description of statistical tests, plus all  related computations, computer programs and final results. Summary  descriptions of input data shall be submitted. Upon request, the actual  input data shall be made available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of all studies and analyses offered in evidence in  common carrier hearing proceedings, other than the kinds described in  paragraph (a) of this section, there shall be a clear statement of the  study plan, all relevant assumptions and a description of the techniques  of data collection, estimation and/or testing. In addition, there shall  be a clear statement of the facts and judgments upon which conclusions  are based and a statement of the relative weights given to the various  factors in arriving at each conclusion, together with an indication of  the alternative courses of action considered.
