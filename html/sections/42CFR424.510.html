Each submitted enrollment  application must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Complete, accurate, and truthful responses to all information  requested within each section as applicable to the provider or supplier  type.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submission of all documentation required by CMS under this or  other statutory or regulatory authority, or under the Paperwork  Reduction Act of 1995, to uniquely identify the provider or supplier.  This documentation may include, but is not limited to, proof of the  legal business name, practice location, social security number (SSN),  tax identification number (TIN), National Provider Identifier (NPI), if  issued, and owners of the business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submission of all documentation, including--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All applicable Federal and State licenses, certifications  including, but not limited to Federal Aviation Administration; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Documentation associated with regulatory and statutory  requirements necessary to establish a provider's or supplier's  eligibility to furnish Medicare covered items or services to  beneficiaries in the Medicare program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At the time of enrollment, an enrollment change request,  revalidation or change of Medicare contractors where the provider or  supplier was already receiving payments via EFT, providers and suppliers  must agree to receive Medicare payments via EFT, if not already  receiving payment through EFT.

When an authorized official signs the certification statement on behalf  of an organization, the signed statement is considered legally binding  upon the organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Delegation of authority. The original enrollment application  submitted for an organization's initial enrollment and all subsequent  enrollment applications submitted for periodic revalidation of the  organization's enrollment data (as required to maintain enrollment in  the Medicare program) must be signed by an authorized official. Any  updates or changes reported outside of the initial enrollment or  periodic revalidation process may be signed by a delegated official(s)  of the organization. The delegated official's signature binds the  organization both legally and financially, as if the signature was that  of the authorized official. Before the delegation of authority is  established, the only acceptable signature on the enrollment application  to report updates or changes to the enrollment information is that of  the authorized official currently on file with Medicare. Once the  delegation of authority is established, the only acceptable signatures  on correspondence to report updates or changes to the enrollment  information are those of the authorized official and the person(s) to  whom this authority is delegated in accordance with the requirements  described in this section. Individual practitioners and sole proprietors  cannot delegate signature authority when submitting an enrollment  application for any reason. All enrollment applications submitted by  individual practitioners and sole proprietors must be signed by the  enrolling or enrolled individual. Each delegation of authority to a  delegated official must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Be assigned by the authorized official currently on file with  CMS;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Be submitted to CMS using the appropriate enrollment application  or CMS established electronic enrollment process;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Include the title and SSN of each person delegated authority to  update or change the organization's enrollment information;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Be an individual that has an ownership or control interest in  the organization or is a W-2 managing employee as defined in section  1126(b) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Be signed by the authorized official and the delegated  official(s) of the organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verification of information. The information submitted by the  provider or supplier on the applicable enrollment application must be  such that CMS can validate it for accuracy at the time of submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Completion of any applicable State surveys, certifications, and  provider agreements. The providers or suppliers who are mandated under  the provision in part 488 of this chapter to be surveyed or certified by  the State survey and certification agency, and to also enter into and  sign a provider agreement as outlined in part 489 of this chapter, must  also meet those requirements as part of the process to obtain Medicare  billing privileges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ability to furnish Medicare covered items or services. The  provider or supplier must be operational to furnish Medicare covered  items or services before being granted Medicare billing privileges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Additional requirements. Providers and suppliers must meet the  provisions of Sec. 424.520 regarding additional compliance and reporting  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> On-site review. CMS reserves the right, when deemed necessary,  to perform on-site inspections of a provider or supplier to verify that  the enrollment information submitted to CMS or its agents is accurate  and to determine   compliance with Medicare enrollment requirements. Site visits for  enrollment purposes do not affect those site visits performed for  establishing compliance with conditions of participation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medicare Part A providers. CMS determines, upon on-site review,  that the provider is no longer operational to furnish Medicare covered  items or services, or the provider fails to satisfy any of the Medicare  enrollment requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Medicare Part B suppliers. CMS determines, upon review that the  supplier is no longer operational to furnish Medicare covered items or  services, or the supplier has failed to satisfy any or all of the  Medicare enrollment requirements, or has failed to furnish Medicare  covered items or services as required by the statute or regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> In order to obtain enrollment and to maintain enrollment for the  first three months after Medicare billing privileges are conveyed, a  home health agency must satisfy the home health ``initial reserve  operating funds'' requirement as set forth in Sec. 489.28 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Providers and suppliers must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agree to receive Medicare payment via electronic funds transfer  (EFT) at the time of enrollment, revalidation, change of Medicare  contractors where the provider or supplier was already receiving  payments via EFT or submission of an enrollment change request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit the CMS-588 form to receive Medicare payment via  electronic funds transfer.
