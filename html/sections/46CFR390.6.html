                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Maritime Administrator will administer and  enforce the agreement in a manner which will insure that the fund is  properly established, that the assets in the fund are used to accomplish  the program and that the party fully complies with all obligations and  responsibilities. This   section specifies the reports which must be submitted to the Maritime  Administrator and sets forth the procedures for administering the  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph describes  the reports required to be submitted to the Maritime Administrator by  the party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submission dates. Reports must be submitted annually, in  triplicate, for the party's taxable year not later than 90 days after  the close of each reporting period. An affidavit regarding the operation  of qualified agreement vessels as required by paragraph (b)(7) of this  section shall be submitted concurrently with each annual report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cumulation. The annual report submitted following the close of  the party's taxable year shall be cumulative for the party's entire  taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certification. The annual report shall be accompanied by an  opinion of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that  exhibits (see paragraph (b)(5) of this section) composing the accounting  have been prepared in accordance with all published orders, rules,  regulations and instructions issued or adopted by the Maritime  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Format. The reports shall consist of the following exhibits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Exhibit A''--a summary of cash, securities and stock on  deposit (showing the adjusted basis for securities and stock), including  a subtotal of cash, securities and stock on deposit, net amount of  accrued deposits to and accrued withdrawals from the fund and the fund  total at the end of the period, and if applicable, a summary of the  portion of the fund which represents a ``CCF: Security Amount'' pursuant  to an Agreement Covering the Dual Use of a Capital Construction Fund;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Exhibit A-1''--a summary of balances in all cash accounts  within the fund at the end of the period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Exhibit A-2''--a summary of the securities and stock within  the fund at the end of the period (showing both the adjusted basis and  fair market value of each item);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ``Exhibit A-3''--a summary of the accrued deposits to and  accrued withdrawals from the fund at the end of the period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ``Exhibit B''--a transcript of transactions occurring within the  fund during the period by date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> ``Exhibit C''--a summary showing the opening balance, additions  thereto due to deposits to the fund, subtractions therefrom due to  withdrawals from the fund, and the closing balance for the period for  each of the three separate accounts: ordinary income account, capital  gains account and capital account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> ``Exhibit D''--a summary, by vessel, of the qualified  withdrawals made from the fund during the period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sample report. A sample report is contained in appendix III of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Affidavit. An official of the party who is knowledgeable about  the operation of the party's qualified agreement vessels shall submit an  affidavit for each taxable year indicating that the party's qualified  agreement vessels operated only in qualified trades during such taxable  year, or if any such vessel operated in a trade other than a qualified  trade, the details of such operation. See Sec. 390.5(c) of this part  for a description of what constitutes a qualified trade. A sample  affidavit is contained in appendix V of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Failure to submit reports. The failure by a party to make the  timely submission of any report or affidavit required by this section  shall constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime  Administrator shall determine that such failure was excusable. See Sec.  390.13 (relating to the failure to fulfill a substantial obligation  under the agreement).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review in the event of changed circumstances. Each agreement  provides that the party shall promptly inform the Maritime Administrator  of any change in circumstances which affects its agreement. Such changes  may be mere form, such as a change of the party's name, or substantive  such as the sale of an eligible agreement vessel. The Maritime  Administrator may require a full review of the agreement if in his  opinion the changed circumstances materially affect the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification of agreement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The agreement is  subject to   modification and amendment by mutual consent. However, except in special  circumstances, the Maritime Administrator will not consent to  modification or amendment of the standard part of the agreement unless  such modification or amendment is of uniform application to similarly  situated parties. The Maritime Administrator will normally agree to  modification or amendment of the schedules subject to the restriction in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on modification of schedules. The Maritime  Administrator will not agree to modification or amendment of the  schedules (as described in Sec. 390.4) when, in his opinion, such  modification or amendment delays imposition of Federal Income Tax in a  manner not contemplated or authorized by the Act, or if the proposed  modification or amendment would not be in consonance with the policies  of the Act, these rules and regulations or the joint regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fund adjustment upon modification. Upon application by a party  for modification or amendment of the agreement, the Maritime  Administrator will determine whether the requested modification or  amendment would result in an amount held in the fund in excess of an  amount determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the  program. If such an excess is created in the fund by such modification  or amendment, the Maritime Administrator will require a nonqualified  withdrawal (as defined in Sec. 390.10) of such excess as a condition to  the modification or amendment.
