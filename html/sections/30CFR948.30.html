                            <p class="depth0">Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between the State of  West Virginia (State) acting by and through the Governor, and the United  States Department of the Interior (Department), acting by and through  the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).</p><p class="depth0">Article I: Introduction, Purpose and Responsible Administrative Agency</p><p class="depth0">A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the  Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (the Federal Act), 30 U.S.C.  1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program  approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 to elect to enter into an Agreement for  the regulation and control of surface coal mining and reclamation  operations on Federal lands within that State. This Agreement provides  for such regulation within West Virginia except on lands containing  leased Federal coal consistent with the State and Federal Acts, the West  Virginia State Program (State program), and the Federal Lands Program  (section 523(a) of the Federal Act and 30 CFR parts 740-745).</p><p class="depth0">B. Purpose: The purpose of the Agreement is to: (1) Foster State- Federal cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and  reclamation operations on Federal lands; (2) eliminate unnecessary  intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and  effective application of the State program on all lands except those  containing leased Federal coal in West Virginia.</p><p class="depth0">C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Department of Natural  Resources, Reclamation Division (DNR) is responsible for administering  this Agreement on behalf of the Governor on Federal lands throughout the  State. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is  responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary,  in accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR Chapter VII. The Federal  lands in West Virginia covered by this Agreement are predominantly those  under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture,  Forest Service. It is understood by all parties that the Forest Service  or the Federal land management agency, if other than the Forest Service,  will continue to govern mining operations on Federal lands covered by  this agreement pursuant to laws, regulations, agreements, and  restrictions for which the respective agency is responsible. These  requirements are in addition to the requirements discussed in this  Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Article II: Effective Date</p><p class="depth0">After it has been signed by the Governor and the Secretary, the  Agreement shall take effect upon publication in the Federal Register as  a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as  provided in Article X.</p><p class="depth0">Article III: Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 30 CFR  parts 700, 701 and 740, and the State program shall be given the  meanings set forth in said definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV: Applicability</p><p class="depth0">A. Applicability to Federal Lands: In accordance with the Federal  Lands Program in 30 CFR part 740, the laws, rules, terms, and conditions  of the State program (as conditionally approved effective January 21,  1981, 30 CFR part 948, or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30  CFR 732.17) are applicable to Federal lands within West Virginia. This  Agreement does not apply to operations on Federal lands containing  leased Federal coal.</p><p class="depth0">B. Filing of Appeals: Orders and decisions issued by DNR in  accordance with the State   program that are appealable shall be appealed to the State of West  Virginia's Reclamation Board of Review. Orders and decisions issued by  the Department that are appealable shall be appealed to the Department  of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p><p class="depth0">Article V: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all  of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the  conditions and requirements specified in this Article.</p><p class="depth0">A.

Requirements of the West Virginia DNR Reclamation Division  ``Technical Handbook of Standards and Specifications for Mining  Operations (1981).''</p><p class="depth0">B. Review Procedures: 1. DNR shall assume primary responsibility for  the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of permit application  packages required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and  reclamation operations on Federal lands in West Virginia except those  containing leased Federal coal. DNR shall be the primary point of  contact for operators regarding decisions on the permit application  package and will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint  State-Federal or Federal determinations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Upon receipt of a permit application package that involves  surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered  by this agreement, DNR shall (1) transmit a copy of the complete permit  application package to the Federal land management agency with a request  for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(b)(4), and (2) provide OSM with  relevant information to allow OSM to determine whether or not the  proposed surface coal mining and reclamation   operation is prohibited or limited by the requirements of section 522(e)  of the Federal Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR parts 760-762 with  respect to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for  mining. DNR shall be responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the  views and determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction  or responsibility over Federal lands affected by a permit application  package in West Virginia.</p><p class="depth0">3. OSM will provide technical assistance to DNR when requested if  available resources allow and will process requests for determinations  of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761  relating to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for  mining. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM  receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DNR. OSM shall have  access to DNR files concerning mines on Federal lands. The Secretary  reserves the right to act independently of DNR to carry out his  responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of all  resulting correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on  decisions regarding the permit application package shall be sent to the  State.</p><p class="depth0">4. DNR shall prepare the required technical analysis and written  findings on the permit application package. If requested by the Federal  land management agency, a draft of these documents shall be sent to it  for review and comment.</p><p class="depth0">5. The permit issued by DNR shall incorporate any terms or  conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including  conditions relating to post-mining land use, and shall condition the  initiation of surface coal mining operations on compliance with the  requirements of the Federal land management agency. After DNR issues the  decision on the permit application package, it shall send a notice to  the applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSM with a  statement of findings and conclusions in support of the action.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII: Inspections</p><p class="depth0">DNR shall conduct inspections on Federal lands covered by this  agreement and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the  approved Program</p><p class="depth0">A. Inspection Reports: DNR shall, within 15 days of conducting any  inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection report  describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2)  whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and  reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which specific  operations are being conducted.</p><p class="depth0">B. DNR Authority: DNR shall be the point of contact and primary  inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations  and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except  as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. Nothing  in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or  State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">C. OSM Authority: OSM may conduct inspections of surface coal mining  and reclamation operations on Federal lands for the purpose of  evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and  to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met. In  order to facilitate a joint Federal-State inspection, OSM will  ordinarily give DNR notice of its intent to conduct an inspection. When  OSM is responsing to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the  health or safety of the public or a significant, imminent environmental  harm pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact DNR if  circumstances and time allow, prior to the Federal inspection. OSM may  conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842. If an  inspection is made without DNR inspectors, OSM shall provide DNR with a  copy of the inspection report within 15 days after inspection. The  Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice  to DNR to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.</p><p class="depth0">D.

Notification: DNR shall promptly notify the Federal land  management agency of all violations of applicable laws, regulations,  orders, and approved permits subject to this Agreement and of all  actions taken with respect to such violations.</p><p class="depth0">C. Secretary's Authority: (1) This Agreement does not affect or  limit the Secretary's authority to enforce provisions of laws other than  the Act. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSM or any joint  inspection where DNR and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of  any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action  necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement  action shall be based on the Act or the substantive requirements of the  State program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system  contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX: Bonds</p><p class="depth0">A. Performance Bond: DNR shall require all operators on Federal  lands to submit a performance bond to cover the operator's  responsibilities under the Federal Act and the State program, payable to  both the United States and West Virginia. The performance bond shall be  of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of both State and  Federal law, and release of the performance bond shall be conditioned  upon compliance with all applicable requirements. DNR may release the  operator from any obligation under the performance bond with the  concurrence of the Federal land management agency. If this Agreement is  terminated: (1) The bond will revert to being payable only to the United  States to the extent that Federal lands are involved, and (2) the bond  will be delivered by DNR to OSM if only Federal lands are covered by the  bond.</p><p class="depth0">B.

Time for Changes: The Secretary or the State may from time to  time promulgate new Federal or State regulations, including new or  revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement or  administration procedures. OSM and DNR shall immediately inform each  other of any final changes and of any effect such changes may have on  the cooperative agreement. If it is determined to be necessary to keep  this Agreement in force, DNR shall request necessary State legislative  action and each party shall change or revise its regulations or  promulgate new regulations, as applicable. Such changes shall be made  under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the approved  State program and sections 501 and 523 of the Federal Act for changes to  the Federal lands program.</p><p class="depth0">B. Copies of Changes: The State and OSM shall provide each other  with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations,  and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this  Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIV: Changes in Personnel and Organization</p><p class="depth0">DNR and the Secretary shall, consistent with 30 CFR part 745, advise  each other of changes in the organization, structure, functions, duties,  and funds of the offices, departments, divisions, and persons within  their organizations which could affect administration and enforcement of  this Agreement.
