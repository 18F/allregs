                                Sec. 56.4911-2  Lobbying expenditures, direct lobbying
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lobbying expenditures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An electing public  charity's lobbying expenditures for a year are the sum of its  expenditures during that year for direct lobbying communications  (``direct lobbying expenditures'') plus its expenditures during that  year for grass roots lobbying communications (``grass roots  expenditures'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3). As mentioned above, paragraph (b)(5) of this section sets  forth the special rebuttable presumption regarding a limited number of  paid mass media communications about highly publicized legislation.  Paragraph (d) of this section contains definitions of (and examples  illustrating) various terms used in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Influencing legislation: direct and grass roots lobbying  communications defined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct lobbying communication--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Definition. A direct lobbying communication is any attempt to influence  any legislation through communication with:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any member or employee of a legislative body; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any government official or employee (other than a member or  employee of a legislative body) who may participate in the formulation  of the legislation, but only if the principal purpose of the  communication is to influence legislation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Required elements. A communication with a legislator or  government official will be treated as a direct lobbying communication  under this Sec. 56.4911-2(b)(1) if, but only if, the communication:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Refers to specific legislation (see paragraph (d)(1) of this  section for a definition of the term ``specific legislation''); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reflects a view on such legislation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for referenda, ballot initiatives or similar  procedures. Solely for purposes of this section 4911, where a  communication refers to and reflects a view on a measure that is the  subject of a referendum, ballot initiative or similar procedure, the  general public in the State or locality where the vote will take place  constitutes the legislative body, and individual members of the general  public area, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), legislators.  Accordingly, if such a communication is made to one or more members of  the general public in that state or locality, the communication is a  direct lobbying communication (unless it is nonpartisan analysis, study  or research (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grass roots lobbying communication--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition. A grass  roots lobbying communication is any attempt to influence any legislation  through an attempt to affect the opinions of the general public or any  segment thereof.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> if,  but only if, the communication:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Refers to specific legislation (see paragraph (d)(1) of this  section for a definition of the term ``specific legislation'');</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reflects a view on such legislation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Encourages the recipient of the communication to take action  with respect to such legislation (see paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this  section for the definition of encouraging the recipient to take action.  For special, more lenient rules regarding an organization's  communications directed only or primarily to bona fide members of the  organization, see Sec. 56.4911-5. For special rules regarding certain  paid mass media advertisements about highly publicized legislation, see  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For special rules regarding lobbying  on referenda, ballot initiatives and similar procedures, see paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of encouraging recipient to take action. For  purposes of this section, encouraging a recipient to take action with  respect to legislation means that the communication:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> States that the recipient should contact a legislator or an  employee of a legislative body, or should contact any other government  official or employee who may participate in the formulation of  legislation (but only if the principal purpose of urging contact with  the government official or employee is to influence legislation);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> States the address, telephone number, or similar information of  a legislator or an employee of a legislative body;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Provides a petition, tear-off postcard or similar material for  the recipient to communicate with a legislator or an employee of a  legislative body, or with any other government official or employee who  may participate in the formulation of legislation (but only if the  principal purpose of so facilitating contact with the government  official or employee is to influence legislation); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> does not include naming the main sponsor(s) of  the legislation for purposes of identifying the legislation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Definition of directly encouraging recipient to take action.  Communications described in one or more of paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A)  through (C) of this section not only ``encourage,'' but also ``directly  encourage'' the recipient to take action with respect to legislation.  Communications described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section,  however, do not directly encourage the recipient to take action with  respect to legislation. Thus, a communication would encourage the  recipient to take action with respect to legislation, but not directly  encourage such action, if the communication does no more than identify  one or more legislators who will vote on the legislation as: opposing  the communication's view with respect to the legislation; being  undecided with respect to the legislation; being the recipient's  representative in the legislature; or being a member of the legislative  committee or subcommittee that will consider the legislation.  Communications that encourage the recipient to take action with respect  to legislation but that do not directly encourage the recipient to take  action with respect to legislation may be within the exception for  nonpartisan analysis, study or research (se paragraph (c)(1) of this  section) and thus not be grass roots lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Subsequent lobbying use of nonlobbying communications or  research materials--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Limited effect of application. Even though  certain communications or research materials are initially not grass  roots lobbying communications under the general definition set forth in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, subsequent use of the  communications or research materials for grass roots lobbying may cause  them to be treated as grass roots lobbying communications. This  paragraph (b)(2)(v) does not cause any communications or research  materials to be considered direct lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Limited scope of application. Under this paragraph (b)(2)(v),  only ``advocacy communications or research materials'' are potentially  treated as grass roots lobbying communications.   Communications or research materials that are not ``advocacy  communications or research materials'' are not treated as grass roots  lobbying communications under this paragraph (b)(2)(v). ``Advocacy  communications or research materials'' are any communications or  materials that both refer to and reflect a view on specific legislation  but that do not, in their initial format, contain a direct encouragement  for recipients to take action with respect to legislation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Subsequent use in lobbying. Where advocacy communications or  research materials are subsequently accompanied by a direct  encouragement for recipients to take action with respect to legislation,  the advocacy communications or research materials themselves are treated  as grass roots lobbying communications unless the organization's primary  purpose in undertaking or preparing the advocacy communications or  research materials was not for use in lobbying. In such a case, all  expenses of preparing and distributing the advocacy communications or  research materials will be treated as grass roots expenditures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Time limit on application of subsequent use rule. The  characterization of expenditures as grass roots lobbying expenditures  under paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) shall apply only to expenditures paid less  than six months before the first use of the advocacy communications or  research materials with a direct encouragement to action.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Safe harbor in determining ``primary purpose''. The primary  purpose of the organization in undertaking or preparing advocacy  communications or research materials will not be considered to be for  use in lobbying if, prior to or contemporaneously with the use of the  advocacy communications or research materials with the direct  encouragement to action, the organization makes a substantial  nonlobbying distribution of the advocacy communications or research  materials (without the direct encouragement to action). Whether a  distribution is substantial will be determined by reference to all of  the facts and circumstances, including the normal distribution pattern  of similar nonpartisan analyses, studies or research by that and similar  organizations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Special rule for partisan analysis, study or research. In the  case of advocacy communications or research materials that are not  nonpartisan analysis, study or research, the nonlobbying distribution  thereof will not be considered ``substantial'' unless that distribution  is at least as extensive as the lobbying distribution thereof.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Factors considered in determining primary purpose. Where the  nonlobbying distribution of advocacy communications or research  materials is not substantial, all of the facts and circumstances must be  weighed to determine whether the organization's primary purpose in  preparing the advocacy communications or research materials was for use  in lobbying. While not the only factor, the extent of the organization's  nonlobbying distribution of the advocacy communications or research  materials is particularly relevant, especially when compared to the  extent of their distribution with the direct encouragement to action.  Another particularly relevant factor is whether the lobbying use of the  advocacy communications or research materials is by the organization  that prepared the document, a related organization, or an unrelated  organization. Where the subsequent lobbying distribution is made by an  unrelated organization, clear and convincing evidence (which must  include evidence demonstrating cooperation or collusion between the two  organizations) will be required to establish that the primary purpose  for preparing the communication for use in lobbying.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2)(v) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth5">Example 1. Assume a nonlobbying ``report'' (that is not nonpartisan  analysis, study or research) is prepared by an organization, but  distributed to only 50 people. The report, in that format, refers to and  reflects a view on specific legislation but does not contain a direct  encouragement for the recipients to take action with respect to  legislation. Two months later, the organization sends the report to  10,000 people along with a letter urging recipients to write their  Senators about the legislation discussed in the report. Because the  report's nonlobbying distribution   is not as extensive as its lobbying distribution, the report's  nonlobbying distribution is not substantial for purposes of this  paragraph (b)(2)(v). Accordingly, the organization's primary purpose in  preparing the report must be determined by weighing all of the facts and  circumstances. In light of the relatively minimal nonlobbying  distribution and the fact that the lobbying distribution is by the  preparing organization rather than by an unrelated organization, and in  the absence of evidence to the contrary, both the report and the letter  are grass roots lobbying communications. Assume that all costs of  preparing the report were paid within the six months preceding the  mailing of the letter. Accordingly, all of the organization's  expenditures for preparing and mailing the two documents are grass roots  lobbying expenditures.</p><p class="depth5">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  costs of the report are paid over the two month period of January and  February. Between January 1 and 31, the organization pays $1,000 for the  report. In February, the organization pays $500 for the report. Further  assume that the report is first used with a direct encouragement to  action on August 1. Six months prior to August 1 is February 1.  Accordingly, no costs paid for the report before February 1 are treated  as grass roots lobbying expenditures under the subsequent use rule.  Under these facts, the subsequent use rule treats only the $500 paid for  the report in February as grass roots lobbying expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, Requests for technical advice;  and paragraph (c)(4), Communications pertaining to self-defense by the  organization. In addition, see Sec. 56.4911-5, which provides special  rules regarding the treatment of certain lobbying communications  directed in whole or in part to members of an electing public charity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct lobbying. The provisions of this section regarding direct  lobbying communications are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Organization P's employee, X, is assigned to approach  members of Congress to gain their support for a pending bill. X drafts  and P prints a position letter on the bill. P distributes the letter to  members of Congress. Additionally, X personally contacts several members  of Congress or their staffs to seek support for P's position on the  bill. The letter and the personal contacts are direct lobbying  communications.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Organization M's president writes a letter to the  Congresswoman representing the district in which M is headquartered,  requesting that the Congresswoman write an administrative agency  regarding proposed regulations recently published by that agency. M's  president also requests that the Congresswoman's letter to the agency  state the Congresswoman's support of M's application for a particular  type of permit granted by the agency. The letter written by M's  president is not a direct lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Organization Z prepares a paper on a particular state's  environmental problems. The paper does not reflect a view on any  specific pending legislation or on any specific legislative proposal  that Z either supports or opposes. Z's representatives give the paper to  a state legislator. Z's paper is not a direct lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. State X enacts a statute that requires the licensing of  all day care providers. Agency B in State X is charged with preparing  rules to implement the bill enacted by State X. One week after enactment  of the bill, organization C sends a letter to Agency B providing  detailed proposed rules that organization C suggests to Agency B as the  appropriate standards to follow in implementing the statute on licensing  of day care providers. Organization C's letter to Agency B is not a  lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 5. Organization B researches, prepares and prints a code of  standards of minimum safety requirements in an area of common electrical  wiring. Organization B sells the code of standards booklet to the public  and its is widely used by professional in the installation of electrical  wiring. A number of states have codified all, or part, of the code of  standards as mandatory safety standards. On occasion, B lobbies state  legislators for passage of the code of standards for safety   reasons. Because the primary purpose of preparing the code of standards  was the promotion of public safety and the standards were specifically  used in a profession for that purpose, separate from any legislative  requirement, the research, preparation, printing and public distribution  of the code of standards is not an expenditure for a direct (or grass  roots) lobbying communication. Costs, such as transportation,  photocopying, and other similar expenses, incurred in lobbying state  legislators for passage of the code of standards into law are  expenditures for direct lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth4">Example 6. On the organization's own initiative, representatives of  Organization F present written testimony to a Congressional committee.  The news media report on the testimony of Organization F, detailing F's  opposition to a pending bill. The testimony is a direct lobbying  communication but is not a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 7. Organization R's monthly newsletter contains an editorial  column that refers to and reflects a view on specific pending bills. R  sends the newsletter to 10,000 nonmember subscribers. Senator Doe is  among the subscribers. The editorial column in the newsletter copy sent  to Senator Doe is not a direct lobbying communication because the  newsletter is sent to Senator Doe in her capacity as a subscriber rather  than her capacity as a legislator. (Note, though, that the editorial  column may be a grass roots lobbying communication if it encourages  recipients to take action with respect to the pending bills it refers to  and on which it reflects a view).</p><p class="depth4">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example (7), except that one  of Senator Doe's staff members sees Senator Doe's copy of the editorial  and writes to R requesting additional information. R responds with a  letter that refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation. R's  letter is a direct lobbying communication unless it is within one of the  exceptions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section (such as the  exception for nonpartisan analysis, study or research). (R's letter is  not within the scope of the exception for responses to written requests  from a legislative body or committee for technical advice (see paragraph  (c)(3) of this section) because the letter is not in response to a  written request from a legislative body or committee).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(C)</em>, with particular regard to the exception for nonpartisan  analysis, study, or research:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Communications that are not grass roots lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth5">Example 1. Organization L places in its newsletter an article that  asserts that lack of new capital is hurting State W's economy. The  article recommends that State W residents either invest more in local  businesses or increase their savings so that funds will be available to  others interested in making investments. The article is an attempt to  influence opinions with respect to a general problem that might receive  legislative attention and is distributed in a manner so as to reach and  influence many individuals. However, the article does not refer to  specific legislation that is pending in a legislative body, nor does the  article refer to a specific legislative proposal the organization either  supports or opposes. The article is not a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example (1), except that the  article refers to a bill pending in State W's legislature that is  intended to provide tax incentives for private savings. The article  praises the pending bill and recommends that it be enacted. However, the  article does not encourage readers to take action with respect to the  legislation. The article is not a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 3. Organization B sends a letter to all persons on its  mailing list. The letter includes an update on numerous environmental  issues with a discussion of general concerns regarding pollution,  proposed federal regulations affecting the area, and several pending  legislative proposals. The letter endorses two pending bills and opposes  another pending bill, but does not name any legislator involved (other  than the sponsor of one bill, for purposes of identifying the bill), nor  does it otherwise encourage the reader to take action with respect to  the legislation. The letter is not a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 4. A pamphlet distributed by organization Z discusses the  dangers of drugs and encourages the public to send their legislators a  coupon, printed with the statement ``I support a drug-free America.''  The term ``drug-free America'' is not widely identified with any of the  many specific pending legislative proposals regarding drug issues. The  pamphlet does not refer to any of the numerous pending legislative  proposals, nor does the organization support or oppose a specific  legislative proposal. The pamphlet is not a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 5. A pamphlet distributed by organization B encourages  readers to join an organization and ``get involved in the fight against  drugs.'' The text states, in the course of a discussion of several  current drug issues, that organization B supports a specific bill before  Congress that would establish an expanded drug control program. The  pamphlet does not encourage readers to communicate with legislators  about the bill (such as by including the names of undecided or opposed  legislators). The pamphlet is not a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 6. Organization E, an environmental organization, routinely  summarizes in each edition of its newsletter the new environment-related  bills that have been introduced in Congress since the last edition of  the newsletter. The newsletter identifies each bill by a bill number and  the name of the legislation's sponsor. The newsletter also reports on  the status of previously introduced environment-related bills. The  summaries and status reports do not encourage recipients of the  newsletter to take action with respect to legislation, as described in  paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A) through (D) of this section. Although the  summaries and status reports refer to specific legislation and often  reflect a view on such legislation, they do not encourage the newsletter  recipients to take action with respect to such legislation. The  summaries and status reports are not grass roots lobbying  communications.</p><p class="depth5">Example 7. Organization B prints in its newsletter a report on  pending legislation that B supports, the Family Equity bill. The report  refers to and reflects a view on the Family Equity bill, but does not  directly encourage recipients to take action. Nor does the report  specifically identify any legislator as opposing the communication's  view on the legislation, as being undecided, or as being a member of the  legislative committee or subcommittee that will consider the  legislation. However, the report does state the following:</p><p class="depth5">Rep. Doe (D-Ky.) and Rep. Roe (R-Ma.), both ardent supporters of the  Family Equity bill, spoke at B's annual convention last week. Both  encouraged B's efforts to get the Family Equity bill enacted and stated  that they thought the bill could be enacted even over a presidential  veto. B's legislative affairs liaison questioned others, who seemed to  agree with that assessment. For example, Sen. Roe (I-Ca.) said that he  thinks the bill will pass with such a large majority, ``the President  won't even consider vetoing it.''</p><p class="depth5">Assume the newsletter, and thus the report, is sent to individuals  throughout the U.S., including some recipients in Kentucky,  Massachusetts and California. Because the report is distributed  nationally, the mere fact that the report identifies several legislators  by party and state as part of its discussion does not mean the report  specifically identifies the named legislators as the Kentucky,  Massachusetts and California recipients' representatives in the  legislature for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. The  report is not a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Communications that are grass roots lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth5">Example 1. A pamphlet distributed by organization Y states that the  ``President's plan for a drug-free America,'' which will establish a  drug control program, should be passed. The pamphlet encourages readers  to ``write or call your senators and representatives and tell them to  vote for the President's plan.'' No legislative proposal formally bears  the name ``President's plan for a drug-free America,'' but that and  similar terms have been widely used in connection with specific  legislation pending in Congress that was initially proposed by the  President. Thus, the pamphlet refers to specific legislation, reflects a  view on the legislation, and encourages readers to take action with  respect to the legislation. The pamphlet is a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  pamphlet does not encourage the public to write or call representatives,  but does list the members of the committee that will consider the bill.  The pamphlet is a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  pamphlet encourages readers to ``write the President to urge him to make  the bill a top legislative priority'' rather than encouraging readers to  communicate with members of Congress. The pamphlet is a grass roots  lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 4. Organization B, a nonmembership organization, includes in  one of three sections of its newsletter an endorsement of two pending  bills and opposition to another pending bill and also identifies several  legislators as undecided on the three bills. The section of the  newsletter devoted to the three pending bills is a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 5. Organization D, a nonmembership organization, sends a  letter to all persons on its mailing list. The letter includes an  extensive discussion concluding that a significant increase in spending  for the Air Force is essential in order to provide an adequate defense  of the nation. Prior to a concluding fundraising request, the letter  encourages readers to write their Congressional representatives urging  increased appropriations to build the B-1 bomber. The letter is a grass  roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 6. The President nominates X for a position in the  President's cabinet. Organization Y disagrees with the views of X and  does   not believe X has the necessary administrative capabilities to  effectively run a cabinet-level department. Accordingly, Y sends a  general mailing requesting recipients to write to four Senators on the  Senate Committee that will consider the nomination. The mailing is a  grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 7. Organization F mails letters requesting that each  recipient contribute money to or join F. In addition, the letters  express F's opposition to a pending bill that is to be voted upon by the  U.S. House of Representatives. Although the letters are form letters  sent as a mass mailing, each letter is individualized to report to the  recipient the name of the recipient's congressional representative. The  letters are grass roots lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth5">Example 8. Organization C sends a mailing that opposes a specific  legislative proposal and includes a postcard addressed to the President  for the recipient to sign stating opposition to the proposal. The letter  requests that the recipient send to C a contribution as well as the  postcard opposing the proposal. C states in the letter that it will  deliver all the postcards to the White House. The letter is a grass  roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Additional examples.</p><p class="depth5">Example 1. The newsletter of an organization concerned with drug  issues is circulated primarily to individuals who are not members of the  organization. A story in the newsletter reports on the prospects for  passage of a specifically identified bill, stating that the organization  supports the bill. The newsletter story identifies certain legislators  as undecided, but does not state that readers should contact the  undecided legislators. The story does not provide a full and fair  exposition sufficient to qualify as nonpartisan analysis, study or  research. The newsletter story is a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  newsletter story provides a full and fair exposition sufficient to  qualify as nonpartisan analysis, study or research. The newsletter story  is not a grass roots lobbying communication because it is within the  exception for nonpartisan analysis, study or research (since it does not  directly encourage recipients to take action).</p><p class="depth5">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that the  newsletter story explicitly asks readers to contact the undecided  legislators. Because the newsletter story directly encourages readers to  take action with respect to the legislation, the newsletter story is not  within the exception for nonpartisan analysis, study or research.  Accordingly, the newsletter story is a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  story does not identify any undecided legislators. The story is not a  grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 5. X organization places an advertisement that specifically  identifies and opposes a bill that X asserts would harm the farm  economy. The advertisement is not a mass media communication described  in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section and does not directly encourage  readers to take action with respect to the bill. However, the  advertisement does state that Senator Y favors the legislation. Because  the advertisement refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation,  and also encourages the readers to take action with respect to the  legislation by specifically identifying a legislator who opposes X's  views on the legislation, the advertisement is a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (5), except that  instead of identifying Senator Y as favoring the legislation, the  advertisement identifies the ``junior Senator from State Z'' as favoring  the legislation. The advertisement is a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth5">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in Example (5), except that  instead of identifying Senator Y as favoring the legislation, the  advertisement states: ``Even though this bill will have a devastating  effect upon the farm economy, most of the Senators from the Farm Belt  states are inexplicably in favor of the bill.'' The advertisement does  not specifically identify one or more legislators as opposing the  advertisement's view on the bill in question. Accordingly, the  advertisement is not a grass roots lobbying communication because it  does not encourage readers to take action with respect to the  legislation.</p><p class="depth5">Example 8. Organization V trains volunteers to go door-to-door to  seek signatures for petitions to be sent to legislators in favor of a  specific bill. The volunteers are wholly unreimbursed for their time and  expenses. The volunteers' costs (to the extent any are incurred) are not  lobbying or exempt purpose expenditures made by V (but the volunteers  may not deduct their out-of-pocket expenditures (see section 170(f)(6)).  When V asks the volunteers to contact others and urge them to sign the  petitions, V encourages those volunteers to take action in favor of the  specific bill. Accordingly, V's costs of soliciting the volunteers' help  and its costs of training the volunteers are grass roots expenditures.  In addition, the costs of preparing, copying, distributing, etc. the  petitions (and any other materials on the same specific subject used in  the door-to-door signature gathering effort), are grass roots  expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for certain mass media advertisements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. A mass media advertisement that is not a   grass roots lobbying communication under the three-part grass roots  lobbying definition contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be  a grass roots lobbying communication by virtue of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)  of this section. The special rule in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) generally  applies only to a limited type of paid advertisements that appear in the  mass media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> is a grass roots  lobbying communication if the communication would be a grass roots  lobbying communication under the rules contained in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Mass media. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(5), the term ``mass media'' means television, radio, billboards and  general circulation newspapers and magazines. General circulation  newspapers and magazines do not include newspapers or magazines  published by an organization for which the expenditure test election  under section 501(h) is in effect, except where both: The total  circulation of the newspaper or magazine is greater than 100,000; and  fewer than one-half of the recipients are members of the organization  (as defined in Sec. 56.4911-5(f)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Paid advertisement. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), where  an electing public charity is itself a mass media publisher or  broadcaster, all portions of that organization's mass media publications  or broadcasts are treated as paid advertisements in the mass media,  except those specific portions that are advertisements paid for by  another person. The term ``mass media'' is defined in paragraph  (b)(5)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Highly publicized. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5),  ``highly publicized'' means frequent coverage on television and radio,  and in general circulation newspapers, during the two weeks preceding  the vote by the legislative body or committee. In the case of state or  local legislation, ``highly publicized'' means frequent coverage in the  mass media that serve the State or local jurisdiction in question. Even  where legislation receives frequent coverage, it is ``highly  publicized'' only if the pendency of the legislation or the  legislation's general terms, purpose, or effect are known to a  significant segment of the general public (as opposed to the particular  interest groups directly affected) in the area in which the paid mass  media advertisement appears.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Organization X places a television advertisement  advocating one of the President's major foreign policy initiatives, as  outlined by the President in a series of speeches and as drafted into  proposed legislation. The initiative is popularly known as ``the  President's World Peace Plan,'' and is voted upon by the Senate four  days after X's advertisement. The advertisement concludes: ``SUPPORT THE  PRESIDENT'S WORLD PEACE PLAN!'' The President's plan and position are  highly publicized during the two weeks before the Senate vote, as  evidenced by: coverage of the plan on several nightly television network  news program; more than one article about the plan on the front page of  a majority of the country's ten largest daily general circulation  newspapers; and an editorial about the plan in four of the   country's ten largest daily general circulation newspapers. Although the  advertisement does not encourage readers to contact legislators or other  government officials, the advertisement does refer to specific  legislation and reflect a view on the general subject of the  legislation. The communication is presumed to be a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the  advertisement appears three weeks before the Senate's vote on the plan.  Because the advertisement appears more than two weeks before the  legislative vote, the advertisement is not within the scope of the  special rule for mass media communications on highly publicized  legislation. Accordingly, the advertisement is a grass roots lobbying  communication only if it is described in the general definition  contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Because the advertisement  does not encourage recipients to take action with respect to the  legislation in question, the advertisement is not a grass roots lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Organization Y places a newspaper advertisement  advocating increased government funding for certain public works  projects the President has proposed and that are being considered by a  legislative committee. The advertisement explains the President's  proposals and concludes: ``SUPPORT FUNDING FOR THESE VITAL PROJECTS!''  The advertisement does not encourage readers to contact legislators or  other government officials nor does it name any undecided legislators,  but it does name the legislation being considered by the committee. The  President's proposed funding of public works, however, is not highly  publicized during the two weeks before the vote: there has been little  coverage of the issue on nightly television network news programs, only  one front-page article on the issue in the country's ten largest daily  general circulation newspapers, and only one editorial about the issue  in the country's ten largest daily general circulation newspapers. Two  days after the advertisement appears, the committee votes to approve  funding of the projects. Although the advertisement appears less than  two weeks before the legislative vote, the advertisement is not within  the scope of the special rule for mass media communications on highly  publicized legislation because the issue of funding for public works  projects is not highly publicized. Thus, the advertisement is a grass  roots lobbying communication only if it is described in the general  definition contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Because the  advertisement does not encourage recipients to take action with respect  to the legislation in question, the advertisement is not a grass roots  lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. Organization P places numerous advertisements in the mass  media about a bill being considered by the State Assembly. The bill is  highly publicized, as evidenced by numerous front-page articles,  editorials and letters to the editor published in the state's general  circulation daily newspapers, as well as frequent coverage of the bill  by the television and radio stations serving the state. The  advertisements run over a three week period and, in addition to showing  pictures of a family being robbed at gunpoint, say: ``The State Assembly  is considering a bill to make gun ownership illegal. This outrageous  legislation would violate your constitutional rights and the rights of  other law-abiding citizens. If this legislation is passed, you and your  family will be criminals if you want to exercise your right to protect  yourselves.'' The advertisements refer to and reflect a view on a  specific bill but do not encourage recipients to take action. Sixteen  days after the last advertisement runs, a State Assembly committee votes  to defeat the legislation. None of the advertisements is a grass roots  lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that it  is publicly announced prior to the advertising campaign that the  committee vote is scheduled for five days after the last advertisement  runs. Because of public pressure resulting from the advertising  campaign, the bill is withdrawn and no vote is ever taken. None of the  advertisements is a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to the definitions of direct lobbying communication  and grass roots lobbying communication--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonpartisan analysis, study,  or research exception--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Engaging in nonpartisan analysis,  study, or research and making available to the general public or a  segment or members thereof or to governmental bodies, officials, or  employees the results of such work constitute neither a direct lobbying  communication under Sec. 56.4911-2(b)(1) nor a grass roots lobbying  communication under Sec. 56.4911-2(b)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research. For purposes of this  section, ``nonpartisan analysis, study, or research'' means an  independent and objective exposition of a particular subject matter,  including any activity that is ``educational'' within the meaning of  Sec. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(3). Thus, ``nonpartisan analysis, study, or  research'' may advocate a particular position or viewpoint so long as  there is a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts  to enable the public or an individual to form an independent   opinion or conclusion. The mere presentation of unsupported opinion,  however, does not qualify as ``nonpartisan analysis, study, or  research''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> in a manner  designed to influence the general public or the action of a legislative  body with respect to a specific legislative proposal, the expenses of  preparing and distributing such part of the analysis, study, or research  will be expenditures for a direct or grass roots lobbying  communications, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>, such communications may not be limited to, or be directed  toward, persons who are interested solely in one side of a particular  issue.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Directly encouraging action by recipients of a communication. A  communication that reflects a view on specific legislation is not within  the nonpartisan analysis, study, or research exception of this paragraph  (c)(1) if the communication directly encourages the recipient to take  action with respect to such legislation. For purposes of this section, a  communication directly encourages the recipient to take action with  respect to legislation if the communication is described in one or more  of paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A) through (C) of this section. As described  in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, a communication would encourage  the recipient to take action with respect to legislation, but not  directly encourage such action, if the communication does no more than  specifically identify one or more legislators who will vote on the  legislation as: opposing the communication's view with respect to the  legislation; being undecided with respect to the legislation; being the  recipient's representative in the legislature; or being a member of the  legislative committee or subcommittee that will consider the  legislation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Organization M establishes a research project to collect  information for the   purpose of showing the dangers of the use of pesticides in raising  crops. The information collected includes data with respect to proposed  legislation, pending before several State legislatures, which would ban  the use of pesticides. The project takes favorable positions on such  legislation without producing a sufficiently full and fair exposition of  the pertinent facts to enable the public or an individual to form an  independent opinion or conclusion on the pros and cons of the use of  pesticides. This project is not within the exception for nonpartisan  analysis, study, or research because it is designed to present  information merely on one side of the legislative controversy.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Organization N establishes a research project to collect  information concerning the dangers of the use of pesticides in raising  crops for the ostensible purpose of examining and reporting information  as to the pros and cons of the use of pesticides in raising crops. The  information is collected and distributed in the form of a published  report which analyzes the effects and costs of the use and nonuse of  various pesticides under various conditions on humans, animals and  crops. The report also presents the advantages, disadvantages, and  economic cost of allowing the continued use of pesticides unabated, of  controlling the use of pesticides, and of developing alternatives to  pesticides. Even if the report sets forth conclusions that the  disadvantages as a result of using pesticides are greater than the  advantages of using pesticides and that prompt legislative regulation of  the use of pesticides is needed, the project is within the exception for  nonpartisan analysis, study, or research since it is designed to present  information on both sides of the legislative controversy and presents a  sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts to enable  the public or an individual to form an independent opinion or  conclusion.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Organization O establishes a research project to collect  information on the presence or absence of disease in humans from eating  food grown with pesticides and the presence or absence of disease in  humans from eating food not grown with pesticides. As part of the  research project, O hires a consultant who prepares a ``fact sheet''  which calls for the curtailment of the use of pesticides and which  addresses itself to the merits of several specific legislative proposals  to curtail the use of pesticides in raising crops which are currently  pending before State Legislatures. The ``fact sheet'' presents reports  of experimental evidence tending to support its conclusions but omits  any reference to reports of experimental evidence tending to dispute its  conclusions. O distributes ten thousand copies to citizens' groups.  Expenditures by O in connection with this work of the consultant are not  within the exception for nonpartisan analysis, study, or research.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. P publishes a bi-monthly newsletter to collect and report  all published materials, ongoing research, and new developments with  regard to the use of pesticides in raising crops. The newsletter also  includes notices of proposed pesticide legislation with impartial  summaries of the provisions and debates on such legislation. The  newsletter does not encourage recipients to take action with respect to  such legislation, but is designed to present information on both sides  of the legislative controversy and does present such information fully  and fairly. It is within the exception for nonpartisan analysis, study,  or research.</p><p class="depth4">Example 5. X is satisfied that A, a member of the faculty of Y  University, is exceptionally well qualified to undertake a project  involving a comprehensive study of the effects of pesticides on crop  yields. Consequently, X makes a grant to A to underwrite the cost of the  study and of the preparation of a book on the effect of pesticides on  crop yields. X does not take any position on the issues or control the  content of A's output. A produces a book which concludes that the use of  pesticides often has a favorable effect on crop yields, and on that  basis argues against pending bills which would ban the use of  pesticides. A's book contains a sufficiently full and fair exposition of  the pertinent facts, including known or potential disadvantages of the  use of pesticides, to enable the public or an individual to form an  independent opinion or conclusion as to whether pesticides should be  banned as provided in the pending bills. The book does not directly  encourage readers to take action with respect to the pending bills.  Consequently, the book is within the exception for nonpartisan analysis,  study, or research.</p><p class="depth4">Example 6. Assume the same facts as Example (2), except that,  instead of issuing a report, X presents within a period of 6 consecutive  months a two-program television series relating to the pesticide issue.  The first program contains information, arguments, and conclusions  favoring legislation to restrict the use of pesticides. The second  program contains information, arguments, and conclusions opposing  legislation to restrict the use of pesticides. The programs are  broadcast within 6 months of each other during commensurate periods of  prime time. X's programs are within the exception for nonpartisan  analysis, study, or research. Although neither program individually  could be regarded as nonpartisan, the series of two programs constitutes  a balanced presentation.</p><p class="depth4">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in Example (6), except that X  arranged for televising the program favoring legislation to restrict the  use of pesticides at 8:00 on a   Thursday evening and for televising the program opposing such  legislation at 7:00 on a Sunday morning. X's presentation is not within  the exception for nonpartisan analysis, study, or research, since X  disseminated its information in a manner prejudicial to one side of the  legislative controversy.</p><p class="depth4">Example 8. Organization Z researches, writes, prints and distributes  a study on the use and effects of pesticide X. A bill is pending in the  U.S. Senate to ban the use of pesticide X. Z's study leads to the  conclusion that pesticide X is extremely harmful and that the bill  pending in the U.S. Senate is an appropriate and much needed remedy to  solve the problems caused by pesticide X. The study contains a  sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts, including  known or potential advantages of the use of pesticide X, to enable the  public or an individual to form an independent opinion or conclusion as  to whether pesticides should be banned as provided in the pending bills.  In its analysis of the pending bill, the study names certain undecided  Senators on the Senate committee considering the bill. Although the  study meets the three part test for determining whether a communication  is a grass roots lobbying communication, the study is within the  exception for nonpartisan analysis, study or research, because it does  not directly encourage recipients of the communication to urge a  legislator to oppose the bill.</p><p class="depth4">Example 9. Assume the same facts as in Example (8), except that,  after stating support for the pending bill, the study concludes: ``You  should write to the undecided committee members to support this crucial  bill.'' The study is not within the exception for nonpartisan analysis,  study or research because it directly encourages the recipients to urge  a legislator to support a specific piece of legislation.</p><p class="depth4">Example 10. Organization X plans to conduct a lobbying campaign with  respect to illegal drug use in the United States. It incurs $5,000 in  expenses to conduct research and prepare an extensive report primarily  for use in the lobbying campaign. Although the detailed report discusses  specific pending legislation and reaches the conclusion that the  legislation would reduce illegal drug use, the report contains a  sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts to enable  the public or an individual to form an independent conclusion regarding  the effect of the legislation. The report does not encourage readers to  contact legislators regarding the legislation. Accordingly, the report  does not, in and of itself, constitute a lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth4">Copies of the report are available to the public at X's office, but  X does not actively distribute the report or otherwise seek to make the  contents of the report available to the general public. Whether or not  X's distribution is sufficient to meet the requirement in Sec. 56.4911- 2(c)(1)(iv) that a nonpartisan communication be made available, X's  distribution is not substantial (for purposes of Sec. 56.4911- 2(b)(2)(v)(E)) in light of all of the facts and circumstances, including  the normal distribution pattern of similar nonpartisan reports. X then  mails copies of the report, along with a letter, to 10,000 individuals  on X's mailing list. In the letter, X requests that individuals contact  legislators urging passage of the legislation discussed in the report.  Because X's research and report were primarily undertaken by X for  lobbying purposes and X did not make a substantial distribution of the  report (without an accompanying lobbying message) prior to or  contemporaneously with the use of the report in lobbying, the report is  a grass roots lobbying communication that is not within the exception  for nonpartisan analysis, study or research.</p><p class="depth4">Example 11. Assume the same facts as in Example (10), except that  before using the report in the lobbying campaign, X sends the research  and report (without an accompanying lobbying message) to universities  and newspapers. At the same time, X also advertises the availability of  the report in its newsletter. This distribution is similar in scope to  the normal distribution pattern of similar nonpartisan reports. In light  of all of the facts and circumstances, X's distribution of the report is  substantial. Because of X's substantial distribution of the report, X's  primary purpose will be considered to be other than for use in lobbying  and the report will not be considered a grass roots lobbying  communication. Accordingly, only the expenditures for copying and  mailing the report to the 10,000 individuals on X's mailing list, as  well as for preparing and mailing the letter, are expenditures for grass  roots lobbying communications.</p><p class="depth4">Example 12. Organization M pays for a bumper sticker that reads:  ``STOP ABORTION: Vote NO on Prop. X!'' M also pays for a 30-second  television advertisement and a billboard that similarly advocate  opposition to Prop. X. In light of the limited scope of the  communications, none of the communications is within the exception for  nonpartisan analysis, study or research. First, none of the  communications rises to the level of analysis, study or research.  Second, none of the communications is nonpartisan because none contains  a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts to enable  the public or an individual to form an independent opinion or  conclusion. Thus, each communication is a direct lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> an organization's discussions  of problems such as environmental pollution or population growth that  are being considered by Congress and various State legislatures, but  only where the discussions are not directly addressed to specific  legislation being considered, and only where the discussions do not  directly encourage recipients of the communication to contact a  legislator, an employee of a legislative body, or a government official  or employee who may participate in the formulation of legislation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for technical advice. A communication is not a direct  lobbying communication under Sec. 56.4911-2(b)(1) if the communication  is the providing of technical advice or assistance to a governmental  body, a governmental committee, or a subdivision of either in response  to a written request by the body, committee, or subdivision, as set  forth in Sec. 53.4945-2(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Communications pertaining to ``self-defense'' by the  organization. A communication is not a direct lobbying communication  under Sec. 56.4911-2(b)(1) if either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The communication is an appearance before, or communication  with, any legislative body with respect to a possible action by the body  that might affect the existence of the electing public charity, its  powers and duties, its tax-exempt status, or the deductibility of  contributions to the organization, as set forth in Sec. 53.4945- 2(d)(3);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The communication is by a member of an affiliated group of  organizations (within the meaning of Sec. 56.4911-7(e)), and is an  appearance before, or communication with, a legislative body with  respect to a possible action by the body that might affect the existence  of any other member of the group, its powers and duties, its tax-exempt  status, or the deductibility of contributions to it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The communication is by an electing public charity more than  75 percent of the members of which are other organizations that are  described in section 501(c)(3), and is an appearance before, or  communication with, any legislative body with respect to a possible  action by the body which might affect the existence of one or more of  the section 501(c)(3) member organizations, their powers, duties, or  tax-exempt status, or the deductibility (under section 170) of  contributions to one or more of the section 501(c)(3) member  organizations, but only if the principal purpose of the appearance or  communication is to defend the section 501(c)(3) member organizations  (rather than the non-section 501(c)(3) member organizations); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The communication is by an electing public charity that is a  member of a limited affiliated group or organizations under Sec.  56.4911-10, and is an appearance before, or communication with, the  Congress of the United States with respect to a possible action by the  Congress that might affect the existence of any member of the limited  affiliated group, its powers and duties, tax-exempt status, or the  deductibility of contributions to it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Under the self-defense exception of paragraphs (c)(4) (i)  through (iv) of this section, a charity may communicate with an entire  legislative body, with committees or subcommittees of a legislative  body, with individual legislators, with legislative staff members, or  with representatives of the executive branch who are involved with the  legislative process, so long as such communication is limited to the  prescribed subjects. Similarly, under the self-defense exception, a  charity may make expenditures in order to initiate   legislation if such legislation concerns only matters which might affect  the existence of the charity, its powers and duties, its tax-exempt  status, or the deductibility of contributions to such charity. For  examples illustrating the application and scope of the self-defense  exception of this paragraph (c)(4), see Sec. 53.4945-2(d)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 4911 and the regulations  thereunder--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legislation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. ``Legislation'' includes action by  the Congress, any state legislature, any local council, or similar  legislative body, or by the public in a referendum, ballot initiative,  constitutional amendment, or similar procedure. ``Legislation'' includes  a proposed treaty required to be submitted by the President to the  Senate for its advice and consent from the time the President's  representative begins to negotiate its position with the prospective  parties to the proposed treaty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of specific legislation. For purposes of paragraphs  (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, ``specific legislation'' includes  both legislation that has already been introduced in a legislative body  and a specific legislative proposal that the organization either  supports or opposes. In the case of a referendum, ballot initiative,  constitutional amendment, or other measure that is placed on the ballot  by petitions signed by a required number or percentage of voters, an  item becomes ``specific legislation'' when the petition is first  circulated among voters for signature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The terms ``legislation'' and ``specific  legislation'' are illustrated using the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A nonmembership organization includes in its newsletter  an article about problems with the use of pesticide X that states in  part: ``Legislation that is pending in Congress would prohibit the use  of this very dangerous pesticide. Fortunately, the legislation will  probably be passed. Write your congressional representatives about this  important issue.'' This is a grass roots lobbying communication that  refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation and that  encourages recipients to take action with respect to that legislation.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. An organization based in State A notes in its newsletter  that State Z has passed a bill to accomplish a stated purpose and then  says that State A should pass such a bill. The organization urges  readers to write their legislators in favor of such a bill. No such bill  has been introduced into the State A legislature. The organization has  referred to and reflected a view on a specific legislative proposal and  has also encouraged readers to take action thereon.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Action. The term ``action'' in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section is limited to the introduction, amendment, enactment, defeat or  repeal of Acts, bills, resolutions, or similar items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Legislative body. ``Legislative body'' does not include  executive, judicial, or administrative bodies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative bodies. ``Administrative bodies'' includes school  boards, housing authorities, sewer and water districts, zoning boards,  and other similar Federal, State, or local special purpose bodies,  whether elective or appointive. Thus, for example, for purposes of  section 4911, the term ``any attempt to influence any legislation'' does  not include attempts to persuade an executive body or department to  form, support the formation of, or to acquire property to be used for  the formation or expansion of, a public park or equivalent preserves  (such as public recreation areas, game, or forest preserves, and soil  demonstration areas) established or to be established by act of  Congress, by executive action in accordance with an act of Congress, or  by a State, municipality or other governmental unit described in section  170(c)(1), as compared with attempts to persuade a legislative body, a  member thereof, or other governmental official or employee, to promote  the appropriation of funds for such an acquisition or other legislative  authorization of such an acquisition. Therefore, for example, an  organization would not be influencing legislation for purposes of  section 4911, if it proposed to a Park Authority that it purchase a  particular tract of land for a new park, even though such an attempt  would necessarily require the Park Authority eventually to seek  appropriations to support a new park. However, in such a case, the  organization would be influencing legislation, for purposes of section  4911, if it provided the Park Authority with a proposed budget to be  submitted to a legislative body, unless such submission is described by  one of   the exceptions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
