Pursuant to section 27(a) of the LHWCA, the Board shall have power to preserve and enforce order during any proceedings for determination or adjudication of entitlement to compensation or benefits or for liability for payment thereof, and to do all things in accordance with law which may be necessary to enable the Board to effectively discharge its duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contumacy. Pursuant to section 27(b) of the LHWCA, if any person in proceedings before the Board disobeys or resists any lawful order or process, or misbehaves during a hearing or so near the place thereof as to obstruct the same, the Board shall certify the facts to the Federal district court having jurisdiction in the place in which it is sitting (or to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia if it is sitting in the District) which shall thereupon in a summary manner hear the evidence as to the acts complained of, and if the evidence so warrants, punish such person in the same manner and to the same extent as for a contempt committed before the court, or commit such person upon the same conditions as if the doing of the forbidden act had occurred with reference to the process or in the presence of the court.</p>
