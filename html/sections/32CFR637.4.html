                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The military police or the USACIDC are authorized to investigate  allegations of criminal activity occurring on the installation. Nothing  in this paragraph is intended to conflict with or otherwise undermine  the delineation of investigative responsibilities between the military  police and the USACIDC as set forth in AR 195-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When investigative responsibility is not clearly defined, and  the matter cannot be resolved between military police investigations  supervisors and USACIDC duty personnel, or between military police  investigations supervisors and unit commanders, the provost marshal will  be informed and will resolve the matter with the appropriate USACIDC  activity commander/Special Agent in Charge (SAC) or unit commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The control and processing of a crime scene and the collection  and preservation of the evidence are the exclusive responsibilities of  the investigator or supervisor in charge of the crime scene when the  military police have investigative responsibility. To prevent the  possible loss or destruction of evidence, the investigator or supervisor  in charge of the crime scene is authorized to exclude all personnel from  the scene. The exercise of this authority in a particular case may be  subject to the requirement to preserve human life and the requirement  for continuing necessary operations and security. These should be  determined in conjunction with the appropriate commander and, where  applicable, local host country law enforcement authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unit commanders should consult with the installation provost  marshal concerning all serious incidents. Examples of incidents  appropriate for investigation at the unit level include simple assaults  not requiring hospitalization and not involving a firearm, or wrongful  damage to property of a value under $1,000. Other incidents should be  immediately referred to the installation provost marshal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The military police desk is the official point of contact for  initial complaints and reports of offenses. The provisions of AR 190-45  are to be followed for all military police records, reports, and  reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When incidents are reported directly to a USACIDC field element,  USACIDC may either direct the reporting person to the MP desk or report  the incident to the MP desk themselves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of the complaint or report of offense, the MP desk  will dispatch an available patrol to the scene of the incident. The  patrol will take appropriate measures to include locating the  complainant, witnesses, suspects, and victims, apprehending offenders,  securing the crime scene, rendering emergency assistance, determining  and reporting to the MP desk, by the most expeditious means possible,  the appropriate activity having investigative responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In those cases in which the USACIDC has an ongoing investigation  (typically fraud and narcotics matters), they may delay notification to  the military police to avoid compromising their investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procedures will be developed to ensure mutual cooperation and  support between MPI, DAC detectives/investigators and USACIDC elements  at each investigative level; however, MPI, DAC detectives/investigators  and USACIDC personnel will remain under command and control of their  respective commanders at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the concurrence of the commander concerned, MPI and DAC  detectives/investigators may provide assistance to USACIDC whenever  elements assume responsibility for an investigation from MPI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When requested by a USACIDC region, district, or the special  agent-in-charge of a resident agency, the provost marshal may provide  MPI or DAC detective/investigator assistance to USACIDC on a case-by- case basis or for a specified time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With the concurrence of the appropriate USACIDC commander, CID  personnel may be designated to assist MPI or DAC detectives/ investigators on a case-by-case basis without assuming control of the  investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modification of investigative responsibilities is authorized on  a local basis if the resources of either USACIDC or the military police  cannot fully support their investigative workload and suitable  alternatives are not available. Such modifications will be by written  agreement signed by the provost marshal and the supporting USACIDC  commander. Agreements will be in effect for no more than two years  unless sooner superseded by mutual agreement.</p>
