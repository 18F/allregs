                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Verification obligation. The Supervisory Committee shall, at least once every two years, cause the passbooks (including any book, statements of account, or other record approved by the NCUA Board) and accounts of the members to be verified against the records of the treasurer of the credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods. Any of the following methods may be used to verify members' passbooks and accounts, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Controlled verification. A controlled verification of 100 percent of members' share and loan accounts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statistical method. A sampling method which provides for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Random selection:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A sample which is representative of the population from which it was selected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An equal chance of selecting each dollar in the population;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sufficient accounts in both number and scope on which to base conclusions concerning management's financial reporting objectives; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Additional procedures to be performed if evidence provided by confirmations alone is not sufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-statistical method. When the verification is performed by an Independent person licensed by the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located, the auditor may choose among the sampling methods set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of

this section and non-statistical sampling methods consistent with GAAS if such methods provide for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sufficient accounts in both number and scope on which to base conclusions concerning management's financial reporting objectives to provide assurance that the General Ledger accounts are fairly stated in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional procedures to be performed by the auditor if evidence provided by confirmations alone is not sufficient; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documentation of the sampling procedures used and of their consistency with GAAS (to be provided to the NCUA Board upon request).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention of records. The supervisory committee must retain the records of each verification of members' passbooks and accounts until it completes the next verification of members' passbooks and accounts.</p>
