                                Sec.  16.131  Exemption of Department of Justice (DOJ)/Nationwide
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C.  552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G) and (H), (e)(5) and  (8), (f) and (g): Nationwide Joint Automated Booking System, Justice/ DOJ-005. These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in  the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and  (k)(2). Where compliance would not interfere with or adversely affect  the law enforcement process, the DOJ may waive the exemptions, either  partially or totally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), and (d) to the extent that  access to records in this system of records may impede or interfere with  law enforcement efforts, result in the disclosure of information that  would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of  collateral record subjects or other third parties, and/or jeopardize the  health and/or safety of third parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that it is necessary to  retain all information in order not to impede, compromise, or interfere  with law enforcement efforts, e.g., where the significance of the  information may not be readily determined and/or where such information  may provide leads or assistance to Federal and other law enforcement  agencies in discharging their law enforcement responsibilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the  application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law  enforcement since it may be necessary to obtain and verify information  from a variety to sources other than the record subject to ensure  safekeeping, security, and effective law enforcement. For example, it  maybe necessary that medical and psychiatric personnel provide  information regarding the subject's behavior, physical. health, or  mental stability, etc. to ensure proper care while in custody, or it may  be necessary to obtain information from a case agent or the court to   ensure proper disposition of the subject individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that agencies  inform each individual whom it asks to supply information of such  information as is required by subsection (e)(3) may, in some cases,  impede the information gathering process or otherwise interfere with or  compromise law enforcement efforts, e.g., the subject may deliberately  withhold information, or give erroneous information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (4)(G) and(H) because the application of these  provisions would present a serious impediment to law enforcement  efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information  for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance  what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the  passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may  acquire new significance and the accuracy of such information can only  be determined in a court of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection  (e)(5) would restrict the ability to collect information for law  enforcement purposes, may prevent the eventual development of the  necessary criminal intelligence, or otherwise impede law enforcement or  delay trained law enforcement personnel from timely exercising their  judgment in managing the arrestee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsection (e)(8) to the extent that such notice may  impede, interfere with, or otherwise compromise law enforcement and  security efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) to the extent that compliance  with the requirement for procedures providing individual access to  records, compliance could impede, compromise, or interfere with law  enforcement efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt  from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
