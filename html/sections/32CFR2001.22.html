                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Information classified derivatively on the basis of source documents or classification guides shall bear all markings prescribed in Sec. 2001.20 and Sec. 2001.21, except as provided in this section. Information for these markings shall be carried forward from the source document or taken from instructions in the appropriate classification guide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identity of persons who apply derivative classification markings. Derivative classifiers shall be identified by name and position, or by personal identifier, in a manner that is immediately apparent on each derivatively classified document. If not otherwise evident, the agency and office of origin shall be identified and follow the name on the ``Classified By'' line. An example might appear as:
Classified By: Peggy Jones, Lead Analyst, Research and Analysis Division orClassified By: ID  IMN01</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Source of derivative classification. (1) The derivative classifier shall concisely identify the source document or the classification guide on the ``Derived From'' line, including the agency and, where available, the office of origin, and the date of the source or guide. An example might appear as:
Derived From: Memo, ``Funding Problems,'' October 20, 2008, Office of Administration, Department of Good Works orDerived From: CG No. 1, Department of Good Works, dated October 20, 2008</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The derivative classifier shall concisely identify the source document or the classification guide on the ``Derived From'' line, including the agency and, where available, the office of origin, and the date of the source or guide. An example might appear as:
Derived From: Memo, ``Funding Problems,'' October 20, 2008, Office of Administration, Department of Good Works orDerived From: CG No. 1, Department of Good Works, dated October 20, 2008</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more than one source document or classification guide, the ``Derived From'' line shall appear as:
Derived From: Multiple Sources</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The derivative classifier shall include a listing of the source materials on, or attached to, each derivatively classified document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A document derivatively classified on the basis of a source document that is itself marked ``Multiple Sources'' shall cite the source document on its ``Derived From'' line rather than the term ``Multiple Sources.'' An example might appear as:
Derived From: Report entitled, ``New Weapons,'' dated October 20, 2009, Department of Good Works, Office of Administration</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reason for classification. The reason for the original classification decision, as reflected in the source document(s) or classification guide, is not transferred in a derivative classification action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Declassification instructions. (1) The derivative classifier shall carry forward the instructions on the ``Declassify On'' line from the source document to the derivative document, or the duration instruction from the classification or declassification guide, unless it contains one of the declassification instructions as listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If the source document is missing the declassification instruction, then a calculated date of 25 years from the date of the source document (if available) or the current date (if the source document date is not available) shall be carried forward by the derivative classifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The derivative classifier shall carry forward the instructions on the ``Declassify On'' line from the source document to the derivative document, or the duration instruction from the classification or declassification guide, unless it contains one of the declassification instructions as listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If the source document is missing the declassification instruction, then a calculated date of 25 years from the date of the source document (if available) or the current date (if the source document date is not available) shall be carried forward by the derivative classifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more than one source document or more than one element of a classification guide, the ``Declassify On'' line shall reflect the longest duration of any of its sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a document is classified derivatively either from a source document(s) or a classification guide that contains one of the following declassification instructions, ``Originating Agency's Determination Required,'' ``OADR,'' or ``Manual Review,'' ``MR,'' or any of the exemption markings X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and X8, the derivative classifier shall calculate a date that is 25 years from the date of the source document when determining a derivative document's date or event to be placed in the ``Declassify On'' line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a document is marked with the declassification instructions ``DCI Only'' or ``DNI Only'' and does not contain information described in E.O. 12951, ``Release of Imagery Acquired by Space-Based National Intelligence Reconnaissance Systems,'' the derivative classifier shall calculate a date that is 25 years from the date of the source document when determining a derivative document's date or event to be placed in the ``Declassify On'' line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a document is marked with ``DCI Only'' or ``DNI Only'' and the information is subject to E.O. 12951, the derivative classifier shall use a date or event as prescribed by the Director of National Intelligence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When determining the most restrictive declassification instruction among multiple source documents, adhere to the following hierarchy for determining the declassification instructions for the ``Declassify On'' line:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 50X1-HUM or 50X2-WMD, or an ISOO-approved designator reflecting the Panel approval for classification beyond 50 years in accordance with section 3.3(h)(2) of the Order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 25X1 through 25X9, with a date or event;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A specific declassification date or event within 25 years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Absent guidance from an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information, a calculated 25-year date from the date of the source document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When declassification dates are displayed numerically, the following format shall be used: YYYYMMDD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Overall marking. The derivative classifier shall conspicuously mark the classified document with the highest level of classification of information included in the document, as provided in Sec. 2001.21(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Portion marking. Each portion of a derivatively classified document shall be marked immediately preceding the portion to which it applies, in accordance with its source, and as provided in Sec. 2001.21(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dissemination control and handling markings. Many agencies require additional control and handling markings that supplement the overall classification markings. See Sec. 2001.24(j) for specific guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Date of origin of document. The date of origin of the document shall be indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent.</p>
