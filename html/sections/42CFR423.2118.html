                            <p class="depth0">An enrollee may request and receive a copy of all or part of the record of the ALJ hearing, including the exhibits list, documentary evidence, and a copy of the CD of the oral proceedings. However, the enrollee may be asked to pay the costs of providing these items. If an enrollee requests evidence from the MAC and an opportunity to comment on that evidence, the time beginning with the MAC's receipt of the request for evidence through the expiration of the time granted for the enrollee's response will not be counted toward the adjudication deadline.</p>
