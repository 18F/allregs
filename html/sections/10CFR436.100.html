The purpose of this subpart is to provide guidelines  for use by Federal agencies in their development of overall 10-year  energy management plans to establish energy conservation goals, to  reduce the rate of energy consumption, to promote the efficient use of  energy, to promote switching for petroleum-based fuels and natural gas  to coal and other energy sources, to provide a methodology for reporting  their progress in meeting the goals of those plans, and to promote  emergency energy conservation planning to assuage the impact of a sudden  disruption in the supply of oil-based fuels, natural gas or electricity.  The plan is intended to provide the cornerstone for a program to  conserve energy in the general operations of an agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This subpart applies to all general operations of Federal  agencies and is applicable to management of all energy used by Federal  agencies that is excluded from coverage pursuant to section 543(a)(2) of  part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as  amended (42 U.S.C. 8251-8261).
