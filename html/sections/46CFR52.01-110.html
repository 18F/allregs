                                Sec. 52.01-110  Water-level indicators, water columns, gauge-glass
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Boiler water level devices. Boiler water level devices shall be  as indicated in PG-60 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure  Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 52.01-1) except as  noted otherwise in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Water level indicators. (Modifies PG-60.1.) (1) Each boiler,  except those of the forced circulation type with no fixed water line and  steam line, shall have two independent means of indicating the water  level in the boiler connected directly to the head or shell. One shall  be a gage lighted by the emergency electrical system (See subpart 112.15  of subchapter J (Electrical Engineering) of this chapter) which will  insure illumination of the gages under all normal and emergency  conditions. The secondary indicator may consist of a gage glass, or  other acceptable device. Where the allowance pressure exceeds 1724 kPa  (250 psi), the gage glasses shall be of the flat type instead of the  common tubular type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gage glasses shall be in continuous operation while the boiler  is steaming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Double-ended firetube boilers shall be equipped as specified in  this paragraph and paragraph (e) of this section except that the  required water level indicators shall be installed on each end of the  boiler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Externally fired flue boilers, such as are used on central  western river vessels, shall be equipped as specified in paragraphs (b)  (1) through (3) of this section except that float gages may be  substituted for gage glasses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Water columns. (Modifies PG-60.2.) The use of water columns is  generally limited to firetube boilers. Water column installations shall  be close hauled to minimize the effect of ship motion on water level  indication. When water columns are provided they shall be fitted  directly to the heads or shells of boilers or drums by 1 inch minimum  size pipes with shutoff valves attached directly to the boiler or drums,  or if necessary, connected thereto by a distance piece both at the top  and bottom of the water columns. Shutoff valves used in the pipe  connections between the boiler and water column or between the boiler  and the shutoff valves, required by PG-60.6 of section I of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for gauge glasses, shall be locked or  sealed open. Water column piping shall not be fitted inside the uptake,  the smoke box, or the casing. Water columns shall be fitted with  suitable drains. Cast iron fittings are not permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gage glass connections. (Modifies PG-60.3.) Gage glasses and  gage cocks shall be connected directly to the head or shell of a boiler  as indicated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When water columns are  authorized, connections to the columns may be made provided a close  hauled arrangement is utilized so that the effect of ship roll on the  water level indication is minimized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Gage cocks. (Modifies PG-60.4.) (1) When the steam pressure does  not exceed 250 pounds per square inch, three test cocks attached  directly to the head or shell of a boiler may serve as the secondary  water level indicator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> See paragraph (d) of this section for restrictions on cock  connections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Pressure gages. (Modifies PG-60.6.) Each double-ended boiler  shall be fitted with two steam gages, one on either end on the boiler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Salinometer cocks. In vessels operating in salt water, each  boiler shall be equipped with a salinometer cock or valve which shall be  fitted directly to the boiler in a convenient position. They shall not  be attached to the water gage or water column.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> High-water-level alarm. Each watertube boiler for propulsion  must   have an audible and a visible high-water-level alarm. The alarm  indicators must be located where the boiler is controlled.
