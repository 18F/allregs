                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This section implements section 1886(b)  of the Act, establishing a ceiling on the rate of increase in operating  costs per case for hospital inpatient services furnished to Medicare  beneficiaries that will be recognized as reasonable for purposes of  determining the amount of Medicare payment. This rate-of-increase  ceiling applies to hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after  October 1, 1982. This section also sets forth rules governing exemptions  from and adjustments to the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This section is not applicable to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hospitals reimbursed in accordance with section 1814(b)(3) of  the Act or under State reimbursement control systems that have been  approved under section 1886(c) of the Act and subpart C of part 403 of  this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Hospitals that are paid under the prospective payment systems  for inpatient hospital services in accordance   with section 1886 (d) and (g) of the Act and part 412 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units that are paid under  the prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric facilities  described in subpart N of part 412 of this chapter for cost reporting  periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units that are paid  under the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital services in  accordance with section 1886(j) of the Act and subpart P of part 412 of  this subchapter for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January  1, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Long-term care hospitals, as defined in section  1886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act, that are paid based on 100 percent of the  Federal prospective payment rate for inpatient hospital services in  accordance with section 123 of Public Law 106-113 and section 307 of  Public Law 106-554 and Sec. 412.533(b) and (c) of subpart O of part 412  of this subchapter for cost reporting periods beginning on or after  October 1, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  1983, this section applies to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hospitals excluded from the prospective payment systems  described in Sec. 412.1(a)(1) of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Psychiatric and rehabilitation units excluded from the  prospective payment systems, as specified in Sec. 412.1(a)(1) of this  chapter and in accordance with Sec. 412.25 through Sec. 412.30 of this  chapter, except as limited by paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (a)(2)(iv) of  this section with respect to psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals  and psychiatric and rehabilitation units as specified in Sec.

For cost reporting  periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, and before October 1,  2006, this section also applies to long-term care hospitals, subject to  paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">Ceiling is the aggregate upper limit on the amount of a hospital's  net Medicare inpatient operating costs that the program will recognize  for payment purposes. For each cost reporting period, the ceiling is  determined by multiplying the updated target amount, as defined in this  paragraph, for that period by the number of Medicare discharges during  that period. For a hospital-within-a-hospital, as described in Sec.  412.22(e) of this chapter, the number of Medicare discharges in a cost  reporting period does not include discharges of a patient to another  hospital in the same building on or on the same campus, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The patient is subsequently readmitted to the hospital-within-a- hospital directly from the other hospital; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The hospital-within-a-hospital has discharged to the other  hospital and subsequently readmitted more than 5 percent (that is, in  excess of 5.0 percent) of the total number of Medicare inpatients  discharged from the hospital-within-a-hospital in that cost reporting  period.</p><p class="depth0">Date of discharge is the earliest of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date the patient has exhausted Medicare Part A hospital  inpatient benefits (including the election to use lifetime reserve days)  during his or her spell of illness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date the patient is formally released as specified in Sec.  412.4(a)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date the patient is transferred to another facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date the patient dies.</p><p class="depth0">Market basket index is CMS's projection of the annual percentage  increase in hospital inpatient operating costs. The market basket index  is a wage and price index that incorporates weighted indicators of  changes in wages and prices that are representative of the mix of goods  and services included in the most common categories of hospital  inpatient operating costs subject to the ceiling, as described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Net inpatient operating costs include the costs of certain  preadmission services as specified in Sec. 413.40(c)(2), the costs of  routine services, ancillary services, and intensive care services (as  defined in Sec. 413.53(b)) incurred by a hospital in furnishing covered  inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries. Net inpatient operating  costs exclude capital-related costs as described in Sec. 413.130, the  costs of approved medical education programs as described in Sec. Sec.  413.75 through 413.83 and 413.85, and heart, kidney, and liver  acquisition costs incurred by approved transplantation centers. These  costs are identified and excluded from inpatient operating costs before  the application of the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0">Rate-of-increase percentage is the percentage by which each  hospital's target amount from the preceding Federal fiscal year is  increased.</p><p class="depth0">Target amount is the per discharge (case) limitation, derived from  the hospital's allowable net Medicare inpatient operating costs in the  hospital's base year, and updated for each subsequent hospital cost  reporting period by the appropriate annual rate-of-increase percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Update adjustment percentage is the percentage by which a hospital's  allowable inpatient operating service costs for the 12-month cost  reporting period beginning in Federal fiscal year 1990 exceeds the  hospital's ceiling for that period.</p><p class="depth0">Update factor is the decimal equivalent of the rate-of-increase  percentage. The update factor is the value by which a hospital's target  amount for the preceding year is multiplied in order to determine the  target amount for the following year. For example, if the rate-of- increase percentage for a year is 2.7 percent, the update factor for  that year is 1.027.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost reporting periods subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Base period. Each hospital's target amount is based on its allowable  net inpatient operating costs per case from the cost reporting period of  at least 12 months immediately preceding the first cost reporting period  subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling established under this section.  If the immediately preceding cost reporting period is a short reporting  period (fewer than 12 months), the first period of at least 12 months  subsequent to that short period is the base period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The target amount established under this provision remains  applicable to a hospital or excluded hospital unit, as described in  Sec. Sec. 412.25 through 412.30 of this chapter, despite intervening  cost reporting periods during which the hospital or excluded hospital  unit is not subject to the ceiling as a result of other provisions of  the law or regulations, or nonparticipation in the Medicare program,  unless the hospital or excluded hospital unit qualifies as a new  hospital or excluded part hospital unit under the provisions of  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The base period for a newly established excluded unit is the  first cost reporting period of at least 12 months following the unit's  certification to participate in the Medicare program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the operational structure of a hospital or unit changes  (that is, a freestanding hospital becomes an excluded unit or an  excluded unit becomes a freestanding hospital, or an entity of a  multicampus hospital becomes a newly created hospital or unit or a  hospital or unit becomes a part of a multicampus hospital), the base  period for the hospital or unit that changed its operational structure  is the first cost reporting period of at   least 12 months effective with the revised Medicare certification  classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Request for rebased target amount for the cost reporting period  beginning on or after October 1, 1997 and on or before September 30,  1998. Except for qualified long-term care hospitals as defined in  paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, each hospital or unit under present  or previous ownership that received payment under section 1886(b) of the  Act during cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1990, may  submit a request to its contractor to rebase its target amount. The  request must be received by the contractor by the later of November 1,  1997 or 60 days before the beginning of its cost reporting period  beginning during fiscal year 1998. The rebased target amount for the  cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998 is determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determine the hospital's inpatient operating costs per case for  each of the five most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each of the five cost reports, update the operating costs  per case by the applicable update factors up to the hospital's cost  reporting period beginning during FY 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exclude the highest and lowest of the five updated amounts  determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Compute the average for the remaining three updated amounts for  operating cost per case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Request by qualified long-term care hospital. A qualified long- term care hospital may file a request to its contractor for a rebased FY  1998 target amount. The request must be received by the contractor by  the later of November 1, 1997 or 60 days before the beginning of its  cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998. The rebased FY  1998 target amount is the hospital's FY 1996 inpatient operating costs  updated to FY 1997. A qualified long-term care hospital means a long- term care hospital that meets the following two conditions for its two  most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 1997:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Its Medicare inpatient operating costs exceed 115 percent of the  ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The hospital would have had a disproportionate patient  percentage (as defined in Sec. 412.106) equal to or greater than 70  percent if it were a prospective payment hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periods subject to the ceiling. The ceiling established under  this section applies to all cost reporting periods that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begin on or after October 1, 1982; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Immediately follow the base period established under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section unless the exception in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Costs subject to the ceiling--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. The ceiling  established under this section applies to net operating costs incurred  by a hospital in furnishing inpatient hospital services to Medicare  beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iv)</em>:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The services are furnished by the hospital or any entity wholly  owned or operated by the hospital. An entity is wholly owned by the  hospital if the hospital is the sole owner of the entity. An entity is  wholly operated by a hospital if the hospital has exclusive  responsibility for conducting and overseeing the entity's routine  perations, regardless of whether the hospital also   has policymaking authority over the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For services furnished after January 1, 1991, the services are  diagnostic (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For services furnished on or after October 1, 1991 through  June 24, 2010, the services are furnished in connection with the  principal diagnosis that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as an  inpatient and are not the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ambulance services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Maintenance renal dialysis services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nondiagnostic services furnished on or after June 25, 2010,  other than ambulance services and maintenance renal dialysis services,  that are furnished on the date of the beneficiary's inpatient admission  or on the calendar day immediately preceding the date of the  beneficiary's inpatient admission and the hospital does not attest that  such services are unrelated to the beneficiary's inpatient admission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rate-of-increase percentages and update factors. The applicable  rate-of-increase percentages and update factors are determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Federal fiscal year 1986. The applicable rate-of-increase  percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  1985 and before September 30, 1986 is five twenty-fourths of one  percent, and the update factor is 1.00208333. For purposes of  determining the target amount for cost reporting periods beginning on or  after October 1, 1986, the applicable percentage increase for cost  reporting periods beginning during Federal fiscal year 1986 is deemed to  have been one-half percent, and the update factor is 1.005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federal fiscal year 1987. The applicable rate-of-increase  percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  1986 and before September 30, 1987 is 1.15 percent; the update factor is  1.0115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Federal fiscal year 1988. The applicable rate-of-increase  percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  1987 and before October 1, 1988 is 2.3238 percent; the update factor is  1.023238. For purposes of updating the target amount for cost reporting  periods beginning on or after October 1, 1988, the rate-of-increase  percentage for cost reporting periods beginning during FY 1988 is deemed  to have been 2.7 percent; the update factor is deemed to have been  1.027.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Federal fiscal year 1989 through Federal fiscal year 1993. The  applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1993, is  the percentage increase projected by the hospital market basket index  (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Federal fiscal year 1994 through Federal fiscal year 1997. The  applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1998, is  the market basket percentage increase minus the lesser of, 1 percentage  point, or the percentage point difference between 10 percent and the  hospital's ``update adjustment percentage'' (as defined in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section); for hospitals with an ``update adjustment  percentage'' of at least 10 percent, the applicable rate-of-increase  percentage is the market basket percentage increase. The ``update  adjustment percentage'' is increased in each Federal fiscal year by the  sum of the hospital's applicable reductions applied to the market basket  percentage increase for previous Federal fiscal years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Federal fiscal year 1998. The applicable rate-of-increase  percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  1997 is 0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Federal fiscal year 1999 through Federal fiscal year 2002. The  applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1, 1998, and before October 1, 2002, based  n data from the most recent available cost report, is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage increase in the market basket, if inpatient  operating costs are equal to or exceed the ceiling amount by 10 percent  or more of the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage increase in the market basket minus .25  percentage points for each percentage point by which inpatient operating  costs are less than 10 percent over the ceiling   (but not less than 0), if inpatient operating costs exceed the ceiling  by less than 10 percent of the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The greater of the percentage increase in the market basket  minus 2.5 percentage points or 0 percent, if inpatient operating costs  are equal to or less than the ceiling but greater than 66.7 percent of  the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> 0 percent, if inpatient operating costs do not exceed 66.7  percent of the ceiling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Federal fiscal year 2003 and following. The applicable rate- of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after  October 1, 2002, is the percentage increase projected by the hospital  market basket index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Target amounts. The contractor will establish a target amount  for each hospital. The target amount for a cost reporting period is  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, and  subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, for  the first cost reporting period to which this ceiling applies, the  target amount equals the hospital's allowable net inpatient operating  costs per case for the hospital's base period increased by the update  factor for the subject period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The hospital-specific target amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of all hospitals and units, except long-term care  hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning during FY 2001, the  hospital-specific target amount is the net allowable costs in a base  period increased by the applicable update factors .</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of long-term care hospitals, for cost reporting  periods beginning during FY 2001, the hospital-specific target amount is  the net allowable costs in a base period increased by the applicable  update factors multiplied by 1.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One of the following for the applicable cost reporting period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1998,  the 75th percentile of target amounts for hospitals in the same class  (psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation hospital or unit, or long- term care hospital) for cost reporting periods ending during FY 1996,  increased by the applicable market basket percentage up to the first  cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1999,  the amount determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)(1) of this section,  increased by the market basket percentage up through the subject period,  subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2000--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The labor-related portion and the nonlabor-related portion of  the wage-neutralized 75th percentile of target amounts for hospitals in  the same class (psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation hospital or  unit, or long-term care hospital) for cost reporting periods ending  during FY 1996, are increased by the applicable market basket percentage  up to the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1,  1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The labor-related portion of the wage-neutralized 75th  percentile target amounts under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)(4)(i) of this  section is wage adjusted by multiplying it by the hospital's FY 2000  hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)(3)(ii)</em> of this section,  subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal years 2001  and 2002--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, increased by the market  basket percentage up through the subject period and further increased by  2 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The labor-related portion of the wage-neutralized 75th  percentile target amounts under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)(4)(i) of this  section is wage-adjusted by multiplying by the hospital's FY 2001  hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index, for cost  reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2001 and the hospital's  FY 2002 hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index for  cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)(4)(ii)</em> of this  section, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of the limits on target amounts established under  paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, each hospital or unit that  qualifies for exclusion as a member of only one class of excluded  facility (psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation hospital or unit,  or long-term care hospital) will be subject to the limit applicable to  that class.

If CMS has authorized the contractor to  make the decision, the contractor issues a decision no later than 180  days after receipt of the completed application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notification and review. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contractor notifies the  hospital of the decision, including a full explanation of the grounds  for the decision. A decision issued under paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of  this section is considered final unless the hospital submits additional  information and requests a review of the decision no later than 180 days  after the date on the contractor's notice of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The final decision is subject to review under the provider  reimbursement determination and appeal procedures in subpart R of part  405 of this chapter, provided the hospital has received an NPR for the  cost reporting period in question, and the NPR disallows costs for which  the hospital had requested an adjustment (see the definitions in Sec.  405.1801(a) of this chapter and the provisions regarding a provider's  right to a Board hearing in Sec. 405.1835 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Extending the time limit for review of NPR.

Sec. 405.1813 and 405.1836 of this  chapter, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Applicability. The provisions in paragraphs (e)(1) through  (e)(5) of this section apply to a hospital's initial request for an  adjustment and to a request for a review of the original decision based  on additional data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Comparison to the target amount for new hospitals and units--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  New hospitals and units--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> New hospitals. For purposes of this  section, a new hospital is a provider of hospital inpatient services  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has operated as the type of hospital for which CMS granted it  approval to participate in the Medicare program, under present or  previous ownership (or both), for less than 2 full years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has provided the type of hospital inpatient services for which  CMS granted it approval to participate in the Medicare program, for less  than 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New units. A newly established unit that is excluded from the  prospective payments system under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 412.25  through 412.30 of this chapter does not qualify for the exemption  afforded to a new hospital under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section  unless the unit is located in an acute care hospital that, if it were  subject to the provisions of this section, would qualify as a new  hospital under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comparison--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A new children's hospital is  exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling imposed under this section. The  exemption begins when the hospital accepts its first patient and ends at  the end of the first cost reporting period ending at least 2 years after  the hospital accepts its first patient. The first cost reporting period  of at least 12 months beginning at least 1 year after the hospital  accepts its first patient is the base year, in accordance with paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 180 days of the date a hospital is excluded from the  prospective payment system, the contractor determines whether the  hospital is exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling. The contractor  notifies the hospital of its determination and the hospital's base  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A decision issued under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section  is considered final unless the hospital submits additional information  and requests a review of the decision no later than 180 days after the  date on the contractor's notice of the decision. The final decision is  subject to review under subpart   R of part 405 of this chapter, provided the hospital has received a  notice of program reimbursement (NPR) for the cost reporting period in  question and the NPR does not reflect an exemption (see the definitions  in Sec. 405.1801(a) of this chapter and the provisions regarding a  provider's right to a Board hearing in Sec. 405.1835 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Median target amount. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning  on or after October 1, 1997, the amount of payment for a new psychiatric  hospital or unit, a new rehabilitation hospital or unit, or a new long- term care hospital that was not paid as an excluded hospital prior to  October 1, 1997, is the lower of the hospital's net inpatient operating  cost per case or 110 percent of the national median of the target  amounts for the class of excluded hospitals and units (psychiatric,  rehabilitation, long-term care) as adjusted for differences in wage  levels and updated to the first cost reporting period in which the  hospital receives payment. The second cost reporting period is subject  to the same target amount as the first cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The national median of the target amounts is the FY 1996 median  target amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adjusted to account for differences in area wage levels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Updated by the market basket percentage increase to the fiscal  year in which the hospital first received payments as an excluded  provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-basis HMOs. Items or services that are furnished to  beneficiaries enrolled in an HMO by a hospital that is either owned or  operated by a risk-basis HMO or related to a risk-basis HMO by common  ownership or control are exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling (see  the definition of an entity with a risk sharing contract in Sec.  417.401 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Adjustments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS adjusts the amount of  the operating costs considered in establishing the rate-of-increase  ceiling for one or more cost reporting periods, including both periods  subject to the ceiling and the hospital's base period, under the  circumstances specified in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the hospital requests an adjustment, CMS makes an  adjustment only to the extent that the hospital's operating costs are  reasonable, attributable to the circumstances specified separately,  identified by the hospital, and verified by the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the hospital requests an adjustment, CMS makes an  adjustment only if the hospital's operating costs exceed the rate-of- increase ceiling imposed under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation  hospital or unit, or long-term care hospital, the amount of payment  under paragraph (g)(3) of this section may not exceed the payment amount  based on the target amount determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a hospital or unit that received a revised FY  1998 target amount under the rebasing provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)  of this section, the amount of an adjustment payment for a cost  reporting period is based on a comparison of the hospital's operating  costs for the cost reporting period to the average costs and statistics  for the cost reporting periods used to determine the FY 1998 rebased  target amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extraordinary circumstances. CMS may make an adjustment to take  into account unusual costs (in either a cost reporting period subject to  the ceiling or the hospital's base period) due to extraordinary  circumstances beyond the hospital's control. These circumstances  include, but are not limited to, strikes, fire, earthquakes, floods, or  similar unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comparability of cost reporting periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adjustment for  distortion. CMS may make an adjustment to take into account factors that  would result in a significant distortion in the operating costs of  inpatient hospital services between the base year and the cost reporting  period subject to the limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Factors. The adjustments described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of  this section, include, but are not limited to, adjustments to take into  account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FICA taxes (if the hospital did not incur costs for FICA taxes  in its base period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Services billed under part B of Medicare during the base period,  but   paid under part A during the subject cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Malpractice insurance costs (if malpractice costs were not  included in the base year operating costs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Increases in service intensity or length of stay attributable to  changes in the type of patient served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A change in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital  provides, and that are customarily provided directly by similar  hospitals, such as an addition or discontinuation of services or  treatment programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The manipulation of discharges to increase reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjusting operating costs. Without a formal request from a  hospital, CMS may adjust the amount of operating costs determined under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section to take into account certain  adjustments. These adjustments include, but are not limited to,  adjustments under paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (E), and (F) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Significant wage increase. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria. CMS may make an  adjustment to take into account a significant increase in wages  occurring between the base period and the cost reporting period subject  to the ceiling if there is a significant increase in the average hourly  wage for the geographic area in which the hospital is located  (determined by reference to the wage index for prospective payment  hospitals without regard to geographic reclassifications under sections  1886(d)(8) and (10) of the Act). For this purpose, there is a  significant wage increase if the wage index value based on wage survey  data collected for the cost reporting period subject to the ceiling is  at least 8.0 percent higher than the wage index value based on survey  data collected for the base year cost reporting period. If survey data  are not available for the cost reporting periods used in the comparison,  the wage index value based on the latest available survey data collected  prior to that cost reporting period is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of the adjustment. The adjustment for a significant wage  increase equals the amount by which the lesser of the following  calculations exceeds 108 percent of the increase in the national average  hourly earnings for hospital workers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rate of increase in the average hourly wage in the  geographic area (determined by applying the applicable increase in the  area wage index value to the rate of increase in the national average  hourly earnings for hospital workers).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rate of increase in the hospital's average hourly wage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjustment limitations. For cost reporting periods beginning on  or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 2003, the payment  reductions under paragraph (c)(3)(v) through (c)(3)(vii) of this section  will not be considered when determining adjustments under this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assignment of a new base period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective  with cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990, CMS may  assign a new base period to establish a revised ceiling if the new base  period is more representative of the reasonable and necessary cost of  furnishing inpatient services and all the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The actual allowable inpatient costs of the hospital in the cost  reporting period that would be affected by the revised ceiling exceed  the target amount established under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The hospital documents that the higher costs are the result of  substantial and permanent changes in furnishing patient care services  since the base period. In making this determination, CMS takes into  consideration the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Changes in the services provided by the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changes in applicable technologies and medical practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Differences in the severity of illness among patients or types  of patients served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The adjustments described in paragraph (g) of this section would  not result in recognition of the reasonable and necessary costs of  providing inpatient services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The revised ceiling is based on the necessary and proper costs  incurred during the new base period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Increases in overhead costs (for example, administrative and  general costs and housekeeping costs) are not taken into consideration  unless the hospital documents that these increases result from  substantial and permanent changes in furnishing patient care services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In determining whether wage increases are necessary and proper,  CMS takes into consideration whether increases in wages and wage-related  costs for hospitals in the labor market area exceed the national average  increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> New base period. The new base period is the first cost reporting  period that is 12 months or longer that reflects the substantial and  permanent change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Reduction to capital-related costs. For psychiatric hospital and  units, rehabilitation hospitals and units, and long-term care hospitals,  the amount otherwise payable for capital-related costs for hospital  inpatient services is reduced by 15 percent for portions of cost  reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 1997 through  September 30, 2002.
