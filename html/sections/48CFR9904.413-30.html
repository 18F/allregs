                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in  this Standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 shall  have the meaning ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph  (b) of this subsection requires therwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accrued benefit cost method means an actuarial cost method under  which units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and  are valued as they accrue; that is, based on the services performed by  each employee in the period involved. The measure of normal cost under  this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the  units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that  period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan's  measurement date is the present value of the units of benefit credited  to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known  as the Unit Credit cost method without salary projection.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actuarial accrued liability means pension cost attributable,  under the actuarial cost method in use, to years prior to the current  period considered by a particular actuarial valuation. As of such date,  the actuarial accrued liability represents the excess of the present  value of future benefits and administrative expenses over the present  value of future normal costs for all plan participants and  beneficiaries. The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the  actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan is the Unfunded  Actuarial Liability. The excess of the actuarial value of the assets of  a pension plan over the actuarial accrued liability is an actuarial  surplus and is treated as a negative unfunded actuarial liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actuarial assumption means an estimate of future conditions  affecting   pension cost; for example, mortality rate, employee turnover,  compensation levels, earnings on pension plan assets, changes in values  of pension plan assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Actuarial cost method means a technique which uses actuarial  assumptions to measure the present value of future pension benefits and  pension plan administrative expenses, and which assigns the cost of such  benefits and expenses to cost accounting periods. The actuarial cost  method includes the asset valuation method used to determine the  actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Actuarial gain and loss means the effect on pension cost  resulting from differences between actuarial assumptions and actual  experience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Actuarial valuation means the determination, as of a specified  date, of the normal cost, actuarial accrued liability, actuarial value  of the assets of a pension plan, and other relevant values for the  pension plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Curtailment of benefits means an event; e.g., a plan amendment,  in which the pension plan is frozen and no further material benefits  accrue. Future service may be the basis for vesting of nonvested  benefits existing at the time of the curtailment. The plan may hold  assets, pay benefits already accrued, and receive additional  contributions for unfunded benefits. Employees may or may not continue  working for the contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Funding agency means an organization or individual which  provides facilities to receive and accumulate assets to be used either  for the payment of benefits under a pension plan, or for the purchase of  such benefits, provided such accumulated assets form a part of a pension  plan established for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and  their beneficiaries. The fair market value of the assets held by the  funding agency as of a specified date is the Funding Agency Balance as  of that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Immediate-gain actuarial cost method means any of the several  cost methods under which actuarial gains and losses are included as part  of the unfunded actuarial liability of the pension plan, rather than as  part of the normal cost of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Market value of the assets means the sum of the funding agency  balance plus the accumulated value of any permitted unfunded accruals  belonging to a pension plan. The Actuarial Value of the Assets means the  value of cash, investments, permitted unfunded accruals, and other  property belonging to a pension plan, as used by the actuary for the  purpose of an actuarial valuation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Normal cost means the annual cost attributable, under the  actuarial cost method in use, to current and future years as of a  particular valuation date, excluding any payment in respect of an  unfunded actuarial liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Pension plan means a deferred compensation plan established and  maintained by one or more employers to provide systematically for the  payment of benefits to plan participants after their retirement,  provided that the benefits are paid for life or are payable for life at  the option of the employees. Additional benefits such as permanent and  total disability and death payments, and survivorship payments to  beneficiaries of deceased employees may be an integral part of a pension  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Pension plan participant means any employee or former employee  of an employer, or any member or former member of an employee  organization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit from a  pension plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such  organization who have satisfied the plan's participation requirements,  or whose beneficiaries are receiving or may be eligible to receive any  such benefit. A participant whose employment status with the employer  has not been terminated is an active participant of the employer's  pension plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Pension plan termination means an event; i.e., plan amendment,  in which either the pension plan ceases to exist and all benefits are  settled by purchase of annuities or other means, or the trusteeship of  the plan is assumed by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation or  other conservator. The plan may or may not be replaced by another plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Permitted unfunded accruals means the amount of pension cost  for   nonqualified defined-benefit pension plans that is not required to be  funded under 9904.412-50(d)(2). The Accumulated Value of Permitted  Unfunded Accruals means the value, as of the measurement date, of the  permitted unfunded accruals adjusted for imputed earnings and for  benefits paid by the contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Prepayment credit means the amount funded in excess of the  pension cost assigned to a cost accounting period that is carried  forward for future recognition. The Accumulated Value of Prepayment  Credits means the value, as of the measurement date, of the prepayment  credits adjusted for income and expenses in accordance with 9904.413- 50(c)(7) and decreased for amounts used to fund pension costs or  liabilities, whether assignable or not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Projected benefit cost method means either (i) any of the  several actuarial cost methods which distribute the estimated total cost  of all of the employees' prospective benefits over a period of years,  usually their working careers, or (ii) a modification of the accrued  benefit cost method that considers projected compensation levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Qualified pension plan means a pension plan comprising a  definite written program communicated to and for the exclusive benefit  of employees which meets the criteria deemed essential by the Internal  Revenue Service as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code for  preferential tax treatment regarding contributions, investments, and  distributions. Any other plan is a nonqualified pension plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Segment means one of two or more divisions, product  departments, plants, or other subdivisions of an organization reporting  directly to a home office, usually identified with responsibility for  profit and/or producing a product or service. The term includes  Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities, and joint  ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the  organization has a majority ownership. The term also includes those  joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the  organization has less than a majority ownership, but over which it  exercises control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Segment closing means that a segment has (i) been sold or  ownership has been otherwise transferred, (ii) discontinued operations,  or (iii) discontinued doing or actively seeking Government business  under contracts subject to this Standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Termination of employment gain or loss means an actuarial gain  or loss resulting from the difference between the assumed and actual  rates at which plan participants separate from employment for reasons  other than retirement, disability, or death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this  chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.  [57 FR 14153, Apr. 17, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 16549, Mar. 30, 1995;  76 FR 81323, Dec. 27, 2011]</p>
