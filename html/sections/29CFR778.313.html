                                Sec. 778.313  Computing overtime pay under the Act for employees
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An example of the operation of a plan of the second type discussed in Sec. 778.312 may serve to illustrate the effects on statutory overtime computations of payment on a task basis. Assume the following facts: The employment agreement establishes a basic hourly rate of $5 per hour, provides for the payment of $7.50 per hour for overtime work (in excess of the basic workday or workweek) and defines the basic workday as 8 hours, and the basic workweek as 40 hours, Monday through Friday. It further provides that the assembling of a machine constitutes a day's work. An employee who completes the assembling job in less than 8 hours will be paid 8 hours' pay at the established rate of $5 per hour and will receive pay at the ``overtime'' rate for hours worked after the completion of the task. An employee works the following hours in a particular week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">M       T       W       T       F       S       S----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hours spent on task.....................................       6       7       7       9  8\1/2\       6       0Day's pay under contract................................     $40     $40     $40     $40     $40     $60       0Additional hours........................................       2       0       2       0   \1/2\       0       0Additional pay under contract...........................     $15       0     $15   $7.50   $7.50       0       0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the example in paragraph (a) of this section the employee has actually worked a total of 48 hours and is owed under the contract a total of $305 for the week. The only sums which can be excluded as overtime premiums from this total before the regular rate is determined are the extra $2.50 payments for the extra hour on Thursday and Friday made because of work actually in excess of 8 hours. The payment of the other premium rates under the contract is either without regard to whether or not the hours they compensated were in excess of a bona fide daily or weekly standard or without regard to the number of overtime hours worked. Thus only the sum of $5 is excluded from the total. The remaining $300 is divided by 48 hours to determine the regular rate--$6.25 per hour. One-half this rate is due under the Act as extra compensation for each of the 8 overtime hours--$25. The $5 payment under the contract for actual excess hours may be credited and the balance--$20--is owed in addition to the $305 due under the contract.
