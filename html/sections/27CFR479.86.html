                            <p class="depth0">The Director will consider a completed and properly executed  application, Form 4 (Firearms), to transfer a firearm. If the  application is approved, the Director will affix the appropriate  National Firearms Act stamp, cancel it, and return the original  application showing approval to the transferor who may then transfer the  firearm to the transferee along with the approved application. The  approval of an application, Form 4 (Firearms), by the Director will  effectuate registration of the firearm to the transferee. The transferee  shall not take possession of a firearm until the application, Form 4  (Firearms), for the transfer filed by the transferor has been approved  by the Director and registration of the firearm is effectuated to the  transferee. The transferee shall retain the approved application as  proof that the firearm described therein is registered to the  transferee, and shall make the approved Form 4 (Firearms) available to  any ATF officer on request. If the application, Form 4 (Firearms), to  transfer a firearm is disapproved by the Director, the original  application and the remittance for purchase of the stamp will be  returned to the transferor with reasons for the disapproval stated on  the application. An application, Form 4 (Firearms), to transfer a  firearm shall be denied if the transfer, receipt, or possession of a  firearm would place the transferee in violation of law. In addition to  any other records checks that may be conducted to determine whether the  transfer, receipt, or possession of a firearm would place the transferee  in violation of law, the Director shall contact the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System.
