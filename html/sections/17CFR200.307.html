                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards to be applied in reviewing requests. In reviewing  requests to amend or correct records, the Privacy Act Officer, or  Division or Office head,   will be guided by the criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), i.e.,  that records maintained by the Commission shall contain only such  information as is necessary and relevant to accomplish a statutory  purpose of the Commission as required by statute or Executive Order of  the President and that such information also be accurate, timely, and  complete. These criteria will be applied whether the request is to add  material to a record or to delete information from a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for acting on requests. Initial review of a request by an  individual to amend or correct a record pertaining to him shall be  completed as promptly as is reasonably possible and normally within 30  days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) from the date the  request was received, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion  of review within that time. If the anticipated completion date indicated  in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the individual requesting the  amendment will be advised in writing of the delay and the reasons  therefor, and also advised when action is expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant of requests to amend or correct records. If a request to  amend or correct a record is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy  Act Officer will: (1) Advise the individual making the request in  writing of the extent to which it has been granted; (2) amend or correct  the record accordingly; and (3) where an accounting of disclosures of  the record has been kept pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), advise all  previous recipients of the record of the fact that the record has been  amended or corrected and the substance of the amendment or correction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of requests to amend or correct records. If an  individual's request to amend or correct a record pertaining to him is  denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly advise the individual making the request in writing of  the extent to which the request has been denied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State the reasons for the denial of the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Describe the procedures established by the Commission to obtain  further review within the Commission of the request to amend or correct,  including the name and address of the person to whom the appeal is to be  addressed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inform the individual that the Privacy Act Officer will provide  information and assistance to the individual in perfecting an appeal of  the initial decision.
