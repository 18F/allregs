If the  contract resulting from this solicitation is awarded on a cost-plus- award fee basis, the Contractor's performance as a Mentor may be  evaluated as part of the award fee plan. Mentor and Protege firms will  develop and submit ``lessons learned'' evaluations to DOE at the  conclusion of the contract. Any DOE contractor that is interested in  becoming a Mentor should refer to the applicable regulations at 48 CFR  919.70 and should contact the Department of Energy's Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization.
