If, upon  such exchange, there were received by the taxpayer money and other  nonexempt property (not permitted to be received without the recognition  of gain), and gain from the transaction was recognized under section  1081 (e), the basis (adjusted to the date of the exchange) of the  property transferred by the taxpayer, decreased by the amount of money  received and increased by the amount of gain recognized, must be  apportioned to and is the basis of the properties (other than money)  received on the exchange. For the purpose of the allocation of such  basis to the properties received, there must be assigned to the  nonexempt property (other than money) an amount equivalent to its fair  market value at the date of the exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 1081(e) provides that no loss may be recognized on an  exchange of stock or securities for stock or securities as described in  section 1081(a), although the taxpayer receives money or other nonexempt  property from the transaction. However, the basis of the property (other  than money) received by the taxpayer is the basis (adjusted to the date  of the exchange) of the property transferred, decreased by the amount of  money received. This basis must be apportioned to the properties  received, and for this purpose there must be allocated to the nonexempt  property (other than money) an amount of such basis equivalent to the  fair market value of such nonexempt property at the date of the  exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 1082 (a) does not apply in ascertaining the basis of  property acquired by a corporation by the issuance   of its stock or securities as the consideration in whole or in part for  the transfer of the property to it. For the rule in such cases, see  section 1082 (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of this section, any reference to section 1081  shall be deemed to include a reference to corresponding provisions of  prior internal revenue laws.</p>
