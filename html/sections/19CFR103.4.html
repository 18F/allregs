                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> and Sec. Sec. 174.32 and 177.10 of this chapter,  to make available for public inspection and copying or, in the  alternative, promptly publish and offer for sale, the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Final opinions and orders, including concurring or dissenting  opinions, made in the adjudication of cases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 120 days of issuance, any precedential decision  (including any ruling letter, internal advice memorandum, or protest  review decision) issued under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, with  respect to any Customs transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been  adopted by the United States Customs Service but are not published in  the Federal Register; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that  affect a member of the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indexes. The United States Customs Service is required by 5  U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to maintain and make available for public inspection  and copying those current indexes which identify any item described in  paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section that is issued, adopted,  or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and that is required to be made  available for public inspection or published. Unless the Commissioner  determines by an order published in the Federal Register that  publication is unnecessary and impracticable, these indexes are  published on a quarterly or more frequent basis and are available for  purchase at each of the public reading rooms listed in Sec. 103.1, at a  cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of failure to publish or make available. No matter,  described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section which is  required by this section to be made available for public inspection or  published, may be relied upon, used, or cited as precedent by the United  States Customs Service against a party, other than an agency, unless  that party has actual and timely notice of such matter or unless the  matter has been indexed and either made available for inspection or  published, as provided by this section. This paragraph applies only to  matters which have precedential significance and does not apply to  matters which have been made available pursuant to Sec. 103.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deletion of identifying details. To prevent an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2),  identifying details contained in any matter described in paragraphs (a)  (1) through (3) of this section are deleted before making that matter  available for inspection or publication. However, in every case where  identifying details are deleted, the basis for the deletion is explained  in writing, giving specific reasons for the deletion and citing the  applicable provision of 5 U.S.C. 552 and Sec. 103.12, in an attachment  to the document from which the identifying details have been deleted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public reading rooms. The United States Customs Service has  available for inspection and copying, in a reading room or otherwise,  the matters described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section  which are required by paragraph (a) to be made available for public  inspection or published in the current indexes. Facilities are provided  whereby a person may inspect and obtain copies of the material. There is  no fee for access to materials, but a fee is charged in accordance with  Sec. 103.10 for a copy of any material provided.</p>
