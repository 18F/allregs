Sec. 1610.7-2  Designation of areas of critical environmental concern.</p><p class="depth0">Areas having potential for Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) designation and protection management shall be identified and considered throughout the resource management planning process (see Sec. Sec. 1610.4-1 through 1610.4-9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The inventory data shall be analyzed to determine whether there are areas containing resources, values, systems or processes or hazards eligible for further consideration for designation as an ACEC. In order to be a potential ACEC, both of the following criteria shall be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relevance. There shall be present a significant historic, cultural, or scenic value; a fish or wildlife resource or

other natural system or process; or natural hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Importance. The above described value, resource, system, process, or hazard shall have substantial significance and values. This generally requires qualities of more than local significance and special worth, consequence, meaning, distinctiveness, or cause for concern. A natural hazard can be important if it is a significant threat to human life or property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State Director, upon approval of a draft resource management plan, plan revision, or plan amendment involving ACECs, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register listing each ACEC proposed and specifying the resource use limitations, if any, which would occur if it were formally designated. The notice shall provide a 60-day period for public comment on the proposed ACEC designation. The approval of a resource management plan, plan revision, or plan amendment constitutes formal designation of any ACEC involved. The approved plan shall include the general management practices and uses, including mitigating measures, identified to protect designated ACEC.</p>
