                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the amount that a national bank or savings association may lend to one borrower under Sec. 32.3 of this part, an eligible bank or eligible savings association with the written approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency may make loans and extensions of credit to one borrower subject to a special temporary lending limit established by the appropriate Federal banking agency, where the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that such loans and extensions of credit are essential to address an emergency situation, such as critical financial markets stability, will be of short duration, will be reduced in amount in a timeframe and manner acceptable to the appropriate Federal banking agency, and do not present unacceptable risk. In granting approval for such a special temporary lending limit, the appropriate Federal banking agency will impose supervisory oversight and reporting measures that it determines are appropriate to monitor compliance with the foregoing standards as set forth in this paragraph.
