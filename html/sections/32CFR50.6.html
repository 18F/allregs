                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No person has authority to enter a DoD installation  to transact personal commercial solicitation as a matter of right.  Personal commercial solicitation may be permitted only if the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The solicitor is duly licensed under applicable Federal, State,  or municipal laws and has complied with installation regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A specific appointment has been made for each meeting with the  individual concerned. Each meeting is conducted only in family quarters  or in other areas designated by the installation commander.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The solicitor agrees to provide each person solicited the  personal commercial solicitation evaluation included in DD Form 2885 \3\  during the initial appointment. The person being solicited is not  required to complete the evaluation. However, completed evaluations  should be sent by the person who was solicited to the office designated  by the installation commander on the back of the evaluation form. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Copies may be obtained from http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2239.html. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The solicitor agrees to provide DoD personnel with a written  reminder, prior to their making a financial commitment, that free legal  advice is available from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Solicitors on overseas installations shall be required to  observe, in addition to the above, the applicable laws of the host  country. Upon request, the solicitor must present documentary evidence  to the installation commander that the company they represent, and its  agents, meet the applicable licensing requirements of the host country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Life insurance products and securities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Life insurance  products and securities offered and sold to DoD personnel shall meet the  prerequisites described in Sec. 50.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Installation commanders may permit insurers and their agents to  solicit on DoD installations if the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section are met and if they are licensed under the insurance laws  of the State where the installation is located. Commanders will ensure  the agent's license status and complaint history are checked with the  appropriate State or Federal regulators before granting permission to  solicit on the installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In addition, before approving insurance and financial product  agents' requests for permission to solicit, commanders shall review the  list of agents and companies currently barred, banned, or limited from  soliciting on any or all DoD installations. This list may be viewed via  the Personal Commercial Solicitation Report ``quick link'' at http:// www.commanderspage.com. In overseas areas, the DoD Components shall  limit insurance solicitation to those insurers registered under the  provisions of appendix B to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The conduct of all insurance business on DoD installations shall  be by specific appointment. When establishing the appointment, insurance  agents shall identify themselves to the prospective purchaser as an  agent for a specific insurer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Installation commanders shall designate areas where interviews  by appointment may be conducted. The opportunity to conduct scheduled  interviews shall be extended to all solicitors on an equitable basis.  Where space and other considerations limit the number of agents using  the interviewing area, the installation commander may develop and  publish local policy consistent with this concept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Installation commanders shall make disinterested third-party  insurance counseling available to DoD personnel desiring counseling.  Financial counselors shall encourage DoD personnel to seek legal  assistance or other advice from a disinterested third-party before  entering into a contract for insurance or securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In addition to the solicitation prohibitions contained in  paragraph (d) of this section, DoD Components shall prohibit the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The use of DoD personnel representing any insurer, dealing  directly or indirectly on behalf of any insurer or any recognized  representative of any insurer on the installation, or as an agent or in  any official or business capacity with or without compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of an agent as a participant in any Military Service- sponsored education or orientation program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The designation of any agent or the use by any agent of titles  (for example, ``Battalion Insurance Counselor,'' ``Unit Insurance  Advisor,'' ``Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Conversion Consultant,'')  that in any manner, states, or implies any type of endorsement from the  U.S. Government, the Armed Forces, or any State or Federal agency or  government entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The use of desk space for interviews for other than a specific  prearranged appointment. During such appointment, the agent shall not be  permitted to display desk signs or other materials announcing his or her  name or company affiliation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The use of an installation ``daily bulletin,'' marquee,  newsletter, Web page, or other official notice to announce the presence  of an agent and/or his or her availability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Supervision of on-base commercial activities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All pertinent  installation regulations shall be posted in a place easily accessible to  those conducting and receiving personal commercial solicitation on the  installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The installation commander shall make available a copy of  installation regulations to anyone conducting on-base commercial  solicitation activities warning that failure to follow the regulations  may result in the loss of solicitation privileges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The installation commander, or designated representative, shall  inquire into any alleged violations of this part or of any questionable  solicitation practices. The DD Form 2885 is provided as a means to  supervise solicitation activities on the installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibited practices. The following commercial solicitation  practices shall be prohibited on all DoD installations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Solicitation of recruits, trainees, and transient personnel in a  group setting or ``mass'' audience and solicitation of any DoD personnel  in a ``captive'' audience where attendance is not voluntary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Making appointments with or soliciting military or DoD civilian  personnel during their normally scheduled duty hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Soliciting in barracks, day rooms, unit areas, transient  personnel housing, or other areas where the installation commander has  prohibited solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of official military identification cards or DoD vehicle  decals by active duty, retired or reserve members of the Military  Services to gain access to DoD installations for the purpose of  soliciting. When entering the installation for the purpose of  solicitation, solicitors with military identification cards and/or DoD  vehicle decals must present documentation issued by the installation  authorizing solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procuring, attempting to procure, supplying, or attempting to  supply non-public listings of DoD personnel   for purposes of commercial solicitation, except for releases made in  accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7.\4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Offering unfair, improper, or deceptive inducements to purchase  or trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Using promotional incentives to facilitate transactions or to  eliminate competition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Using manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent devices, schemes,  or artifices, including misleading advertising and sales literature. All  financial products, which contain insurance features, must clearly  explain the insurance features of those products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Using oral or written representations to suggest or give the  appearance that the Department of Defense sponsors or endorses any  particular company, its agents, or the goods, services, and commodities  it sells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> DoD personnel making personal commercial solicitations or sales  to DoD personnel who are junior in rank or grade, or to the family  members of such personnel, except as authorized in Section 2-205 and 5- 409 of the Joint Ethics Regulation, DoD 5500.7-R.\5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Entering into any unauthorized or restricted area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Using any portion of installation facilities, including  quarters, as a showroom or store for the sale of goods or services,  except as specifically authorized by DoD Directive 1330.17 \6\ and DoD  Instructions 1015.10, 1000.15 \7\ and 1330.21.\8\ This does not apply to  normal home enterprises that comply with applicable State and local laws  and installation rules. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3.</p><p class="depth0">\7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Soliciting door to door or without an appointment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Unauthorized advertising of addresses or telephone numbers used  in personal commercial solicitation activities conducted on the  installation, or the use of official positions, titles, or organization  names, for the purpose of personal commercial solicitation, except as  authorized in DoD 5500.7-R. Military grade and Military Service as part  of an individual's name (e.g., Captain Smith, U.S. Marine Corps) may be  used in the same manner as conventional titles, such as ``Mr.'',  ``Mrs.'', or ``Honorable''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Contacting DoD personnel by calling a government telephone,  faxing to a government fax machine, or by sending e-mail to a government  computer, unless a pre-existing relationship (i.e., the DoD member is a  current client or requested to be contacted) exists between the parties  and the DoD member has not asked for contact to be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Denial, suspension, and withdrawal of installation solicitation  privileges. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The installation commander shall deny, suspend, or  withdraw permission for a company and its agents to conduct commercial  activities on the base if such action is in the best interests of the  command. The grounds for taking these actions may include, but are not  limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to meet the licensing and other regulatory requirements  prescribed in this part or violations of the State law where the  installation is located. Commanders will request that appropriate state  officials determine whether a company or agent violated State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commission of any of the practices prohibited in paragraphs  (b)(6) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substantiated complaints and/or adverse reports regarding the  quality of goods, services, and/or commodities, and the manner in which  they are offered for sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Knowing and willful violations of Public Law 90-321.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Personal misconduct by a company's agent or representative while  on the installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The possession of, and any attempt to obtain supplies of direct  deposit forms, or any other form or device used by Military Departments  to direct a Service member's pay to a third party, or possession or use  of facsimiles thereof. This includes using or assisting in using a  Service member's ``MyPay'' account or other similar Internet medium for  the purpose of establishing a direct deposit for the purchase of  insurance or other investment product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Failure to incorporate and abide by the Standards of Fairness  policies contained in DoD Instruction 1344.9.\9\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\9\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The installation commander may determine that circumstances  dictate the immediate suspension of solicitation privileges while an  investigation is conducted. Upon suspending solicitation privileges, the  commander shall promptly inform the agent and the company the agent  represents, in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In suspending or withdrawing solicitation privileges, the  installation commander shall determine whether to limit such action to  the agent alone or extend it to the company the agent represents. This  decision shall be based on the circumstances of the particular case,  including, but not limited to, the nature of the violations, frequency  of violations, the extent to which other agents of the company have  engaged in such practices and any other matters tending to show the  culpability of an individual and the company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the investigation determines an agent or company does not  possess a valid license or the agent, company, or product has failed to  meet other State or Federal regulatory requirements, the installation  commander shall immediately notify the appropriate regulatory  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In a withdrawal action, the commander shall allow the individual  or company an opportunity to show cause as to why the action should not  be taken. To ``show cause'' means an opportunity must be given for the  aggrieved party to present facts on an informal basis for the  consideration of the installation commander or the commander's designee.  The installation commander shall make a final decision regarding  withdrawal based upon the entire record in each case. Installation  commanders shall report concerns or complaints involving the quality or  suitability of financial products or concerns or complaints involving  marketing methods used to sell these products to the appropriate State  and Federal regulatory authorities. Also, installation commanders shall  report any suspension or withdrawal of insurance or securities products  solicitation privileges to the appropriate State or Federal regulatory  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The installation commander shall inform the Military Department  concerned of any denial, suspension, withdrawal, or reinstatement of an  agent or company's solicitation privileges and the Military Department  shall inform the Office of the PDUSD(P&R;), which will maintain a list of  insurance and financial product companies and agents currently barred,  banned, or otherwise limited from soliciting on any or all DoD  installations. This list may be viewed at http://www.commanderspage.com.  If warranted, the installation commander may recommend to the Military  Department concerned that the action taken be extended to other DoD  installations. The Military Department may extend the action to other  military installations in the Military Department. The PDUSD(P&R;),  following consultation with the Military Department concerned, may order  the action extended to other Military Departments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> All suspensions or withdrawals of privileges may be permanent or  for a set period of time. If for a set period, when that period expires,  the individual or company may reapply for permission to solicit through  the installation commander or Military Department originally imposing  the restriction. The installation commander or Military Department  reinstating permission to solicit shall notify the Office of the  PDUSD(P&R;) and appropriate State and Federal regulatory agencies when  such suspensions or withdrawals are lifted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The Secretaries of the Military Departments may direct the Armed  Forces Disciplinary Control Boards in all geographical areas in which  the grounds for withdrawal action have occurred to consider all  applicable information and take action that the Boards deem appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Nothing in this part limits the authority of the installation  commander or other appropriate authority from requesting or instituting  other administrative and/or criminal action against any person,  including those who violate the conditions and restrictions upon which  installation entry is authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Advertising and commercial sponsorship. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Department of  Defense expects voluntary observance of the highest business ethics by  commercial enterprises soliciting DoD personnel through advertisements  in unofficial military publications when describing goods, services,  commodities, and the terms of the sale (including guarantees,  warranties, and the like).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The advertising of credit terms shall conform to the provisions  of 15 U.S.C. 1601 as implemented by Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z  according to 12 CFR part 226.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Solicitors may provide commercial sponsorship to DoD Morale,  Welfare and Recreation programs or events according to DoD Instruction  1015.10. However, sponsorship may not be used as a means to obtain  personal contact information for any participant at these events without  written permission from the individual participant. In addition,  commercial sponsors may not use sponsorship to advertise products and/or  services not specifically agreed to in the sponsorship agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The installation commander may permit organizations to display  sales literature in designated locations subject to command policies. In  accordance with DoD 7000.14-R,\10\ Volume 7(a), distribution of  competitive literature or forms by off-base banks and/or credit unions  is prohibited on installations where an authorized on-base bank and/or  credit union exists. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Educational programs.

Presentations shall only be conducted at the express request of the  installation commander. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 50.3. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Military Departments shall also make qualified personnel and  facilities available for individual counseling on loans and consumer  credit transactions in order to encourage thrift and financial  responsibility and promote a better understanding of the wise use of  credit, as prescribed in DoD 7000.14-R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Military Departments shall encourage military members to  seek advice from a legal assistance officer, the installation financial  counselor, their own lawyer, or a financial counselor, before making a  substantial loan or credit commitment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each Military Department shall provide advice and guidance to  DoD personnel who have a complaint under DoD 1344.9 or who allege a  criminal violation of its provisions, including referral to the  appropriate regulatory agency for processing of the complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Banks and credit unions operating on DoD installations are  required to provide financial counseling services as an integral part of  their financial services offerings. Representatives of and materials  provided by authorized banks and/or credit unions located on military  installations may be used to provide the educational programs and  information required by this part subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the bank or credit union operating on a DoD installation  sells insurance or securities or has any affiliation with a company that  sells or markets insurance or other financial products, the installation  commander shall consider that company's history of complying with this  part before authorizing the on-base financial institution to provide  financial education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All prospective educators must agree to use appropriate  disclaimers in their presentations and on their other educational  materials. The disclaimers must clearly indicate that they do not  endorse or favor any commercial supplier, product, or service, or  promote the services of a specific financial institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use of other non-government organizations to provide financial  education programs is limited as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under no circumstances shall commercial agents, including  employees or representatives of commercial loan, finance, insurance, or  investment companies, be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The limitation in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section does not  apply to educational programs and information regarding the Survivor  Benefits Program and other government benefits provided by tax-exempt  organizations under section (c)(23) of 26 U.S.C. 501 or by any  organization providing such a benefit under a contract with the  Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Educators from non-government, non-commercial organizations  expert in personal financial affairs and their materials may, with  appropriate disclaimers, provide the educational programs and  information required by this part if approved by a Presidentially- appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian official of the Military Department  concerned.
