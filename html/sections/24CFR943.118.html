                                Sec. 943.118  What is a consortium?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A consortium consists of two or more PHAs that join together to  perform planning, reporting, and other administrative or management  functions for participating PHAs, as specified in a consortium  agreement. A consortium also submits a joint PHA Plan. The lead agency  collects the assistance funds from HUD that would be paid to the  participating PHAs for the elements of their operations that are  administered by the consortium and allocates them according to the  consortium agreement. The participating PHAs must adopt the same fiscal  year so that the applicable periods for submission and review of the  joint PHA Plan are the same. Notwithstanding any other regulation, PHAs  proposing to form consortia may request and HUD may approve changes in  PHA fiscal years to make this possible.</p>
