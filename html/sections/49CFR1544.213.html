The sign must notify individuals that such items are being inspected by an explosives detection system and advise them to remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from checked baggage before inspection. This sign must also advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be made of their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure to an explosives detection system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the explosives detection system exposes any checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection the aircraft operator must post a sign which advises individuals to remove film of all kinds from their articles before inspection. If requested by
