                            <p class="depth0">Section 852(b)(2) requires certain adjustments to be made to convert taxable income of the investment company to investment company taxable income, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The excess, if any, of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss shall be excluded;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The special deductions provided in part VIII (section 241 and following, except section 248), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, shall not be allowed. Those not allowed are the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242, the deductions for dividends received provided by sections 243, 244, and 245, and the deduction for certain dividends paid provided by section 247. However, the deduction provided by section 248 (relating to organizational expenditures), otherwise allowable in computing taxable income, shall likewise be allowed in computing the investment company taxable income. See section 852(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.852-2 for treatment of the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest (provided by section 242) for purposes of computing the normal tax under section 11;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gains dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.852-4); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b). Thus, the taxable income for a period of less than 12 months shall not be placed on an annual basis even though such short taxable year results from a change of accounting period.</p>
