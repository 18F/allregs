Dusts containing  magnesium or aluminum are particularly hazardous and the use of extreme  caution is necessary to avoid ignition and explosion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Class II, Division 2. A Class II, Division 2 location is a  location in which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Combustible dust will not normally be in suspension in the air  in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures, and  dust accumulations are normally insufficient to interfere with the  normal operation of electrical equipment or other apparatus; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dust may be in suspension in the air as a result of infrequent  malfunctioning of handling or processing equipment, and dust  accumulations resulting therefrom may be ignitible by abnormal operation  or failure of electrical equipment or other apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This classification includes locations where dangerous  concentrations of suspended dust would not be likely but where dust  accumulations might form on or in the vicinity of electric equipment.

A utilization system is a system which provides  electric power and light for employee workplaces, and includes the  premises wiring system and utilization equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Ventilated. Provided with a means to permit circulation of air  sufficient to remove an excess of heat, fumes, or vapors.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile flammable liquid. A flammable liquid having a flash point  below 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) or whose temperature is above its  flash point, or a Class II combustible liquid having a vapor pressure  not exceeding 40 psia (276 kPa) at 38 [deg]C (100 [deg]F) whose  temperature is above its flash point.</p><p class="depth0">Voltage. (Of a circuit.) The greatest root-mean-square (effective)  difference of potential between any two conductors of the circuit  concerned.</p><p class="depth0">Voltage, nominal. A nominal value assigned to a circuit or system  for the purpose of conveniently designating its voltage class (as 120/ 240, 480Y/277, 600, etc.). The actual voltage at which a circuit  operates can vary from the nominal within a range that permits  satisfactory operation of equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Voltage to ground. For grounded circuits, the voltage between the  given conductor and that point or conductor of the circuit that is  grounded; for ungrounded circuits, the greatest voltage between the  given conductor and any other conductor of the circuit.</p><p class="depth0">Watertight. So constructed that moisture will not enter the  enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Weatherproof. So constructed or protected that exposure to the  weather will not interfere with successful operation. Rainproof,  raintight, or watertight equipment can fulfill the requirements for  weatherproof where varying weather conditions other than wetness, such  as snow, ice, dust, or temperature extremes, are not a factor.</p><p class="depth0">Wet location. See ``Location.''</p>
