                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions for this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfer of capital means any  payment or forbearance by a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank  (collectively, bank) to an affiliated association, including but not  limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purchase of nonvoting stock or participation certificates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The payment of cash;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Debt forgiveness or reduction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Interest rate concessions or interest-free loans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The transfer of loans at other than fair market value;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The reduction or elimination of standard loan servicing or  other fees; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The assumption of operating or other expenses, such as legal  fees or insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preferential transfer of capital means a transfer of capital  that is not available to all similarly situated affiliated associations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonroutine transfer of capital means a transfer of capital that  is not available in the ordinary course of business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Considerations for preferential or nonroutine transfers of  capital. Before authorizing a preferential or nonroutine transfer of  capital, a bank board of directors must take into account and document  whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transfer of capital is in the best interests of all of the  shareholders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bank will be able to achieve its capital adequacy and  business plan goals after making the transfer of capital; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transfer of capital is the ``least cost'' alternative  available and will enable the association to maintain sound, adequate,  and constructive service to borrowers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification requirements. At least 30 days before making a  preferential or nonroutine transfer of capital to an affiliated  association, banks must provide shareholders and the Chief Examiner of  the Farm Credit Administration with a description of the transfer and  the documentation required by paragraph (b) of this section.
