Sec. 9904.420-10  [Reserved]


Sec. 9904.420-20  Purpose.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to provide criteria for the accumulation of independent research and development costs and bid and proposal costs and for the allocation of such costs to cost objectives based on the beneficial or causal relationship between such costs and cost objectives. Consistent application of these criteria will improve cost allocation.


Sec. 9904.420-30  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in this Standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this Chapter 99 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph (b) of this subsection, requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocate means to assign an item of cost, or a group of items of cost, to one or more cost objectives. This term includes both direct assignment of cost and the reassignment of a share from an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bid and proposal (B&P;) cost means the cost incurred in preparing, submitting, or supporting any bid or proposal which effort is neither sponsored by a grant, nor required in the performance of a contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business unit means any segment of an organization, or an entire business organization which is not divided into segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General and administrative (G&A;) expense means any management, financial, and other expenses which is incurred by or allocated to a business unit and which is for the general management and administration of the business unit as a whole. G&A; expense does not include those management expenses whose beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives can be more directly measured by a base other than a cost input base representing the total activity of a business unit during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Home office means an office responsible for directing or managing two or more, but not necessarily all, segments of an organization. It typically establishes policy for, and provides guidance to the segments in their operations. It usually performs management, supervisory, or administrative functions, and may also perform service functions in support of the operations of the various segments. An organization which has intermediate levels, such as groups, may have several home offices which report to a common home office. An intermediate organization may be both a segment and a home office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Independent research and development means the cost of effort which is neither sponsored by a grant, nor required in the performance of a contract, and which falls within any of the following three areas:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basic and applied research,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Development, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Systems and other concept formulation studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Indirect cost means any cost not directly identified with a single final cost objective, but identified with two or more final cost objectives or with at least one intermediate cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Segment means one of two or more divisions, product departments, plants, or other subdivisions of an organization reporting directly to a home office, usually identified with responsibility for profit and/or producing a product or service. The term includes Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities, and joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the organization has a majority ownership. The term also includes those joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the organizations has less than a majority of ownership, but over which it exercises control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.


Sec. 9904.420-40  Fundamental requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The basic unit for the identification and accumulation of Independent Research and Development (IR&D;) and Bid and Proposal (B&P;) costs shall be the individual IR&D; or B&P; project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; project costs shall consist of all allocable costs, except business unit general and administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; cost pools consist of all IR&D; and B&P; project costs and other allocable costs, except business unit general and administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; cost pools of a home office shall be allocated to segments on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship between the IR&D; and B&P; costs and the segments reporting to that home office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; cost pools of a business unit shall be allocated to the final cost objectives of that business unit on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship between the IR&D; and B&P; costs and the final cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> The B&P; costs incurred in a cost accounting period shall not be assigned to any other cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The B&P; costs incurred in a cost accounting period shall not be assigned to any other cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The IR&D; costs incurred in a cost accounting period shall not be assigned to any other cost accounting period, except as may be permitted pursuant to provisions of existing laws, regulations, and other controlling factors.


Sec. 9904.420-50  Techniques for application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; project costs shall include (1) costs, which if incurred in like circumstances for a final cost objective, would be treated as direct costs of that final cost objective, and (2) the overhead costs of productive

activities and other indirect costs related to the project based on the contractor's cost accounting practice or applicable Cost Accounting Standards for allocation of indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; cost pools for a segment consist of the project costs plus allocable home office IR&D; and B&P; costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the costs of individual IR&D; or B&P; efforts are not material in amount, these costs may be accumulated in one or more project(s) within each of these two types of effort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The costs of any work performed by one segment for another segment shall not be treated as IR&D; costs or B&P; costs of the performing segment unless the work is a part of an IR&D; or B&P; project of the performing segment. If such work is part of a performing segment's IR&D; or B&P; project, the project will be transferred to the home office to be allocated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The costs of IR&D; and B&P; projects accumulated at a home office shall be allocated to its segments as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Projects which can be identified with a specific segment(s) shall have their costs allocated to such segment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The costs of all other IR&D; and B&P; projects shall be allocated among all segments by means of the same base used by the company to allocate its residual expenses in accordance with 9904.403; provided, however, where a particular segment receives significantly more or less benefit from the IR&D; or B&P; costs than would be reflected by the allocation of such costs to the segment by the base, the Government and the contractor may agree to a special allocation of the IR&D; or B&P; costs to such segment commensurate with the benefits received. The amount of a special allocation to any segment made pursuant to such an agreement shall be excluded from the IR&D; and B&P; cost pools to be allocated to other segments and the base data of any such segment shall be excluded from the base used to allocate these pools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The costs of IR&D; and B&P; projects accumulated at a business unit shall be allocated to cost objectives as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where costs of any IR&D; or B&P; project benefit more than one segment of the organization, the amounts to be allocated to each segment shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The IR&D; and B&P; cost pools which are not allocated under subparagraph (f)(1) of this subsection, shall be allocated to all final cost objectives of the business unit by means of the same base used by the business unit to allocate its general and administrative expenses in accordance with 9904.410-50; provided, however, where a particular final cost objective receives significantly more or less benefit from IR&D; or B&P; cost than would be reflected by the allocation of such costs the Government and the contractor may agree to a special allocation of the IR&D; or B&P; costs to such final cost objective commensurate with the benefits received. The amount of special allocation to any such final cost objective made pursuant to such an agreement shall be excluded from the IR&D; and B&P; cost pools to be allocated to other final cost objectives and the particular final cost objective's base data shall be excluded from the base used to allocate these pools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d), (e) or (f) of this subsection, the costs of IR&D; and B&P; projects allocable to a home office pursuant to 9904.420-50(d) may be allocated directly to the receiving segments, provided that such allocation not be substantially different from the allocation that would be made if they were first passed through home office accounts.


Sec. 9904.420-60  Illustrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Business Unit A's engineering department in accordance with its established accounting practice, charges administrative effort including typing its overhead cost pool. In submitting a proposal, the engineering department assigns several typists to the proposal project on a full time basis and charges the typists' time directly to the proposal project, rather than to its overhead pool. Because the engineering department under its established accounting practice does not charge the

cost of typing directly to final cost objectives, the direct charge does not meet with the requirements of 9904.420-50(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Company B has five segments. The company undertakes an IR&D; project which is part of IR&D; plans of segments X, Y, and Z, and will be of general benefit to all five segments. The company designates Segment Z as the project leader in performing the project. In accumulating the costs, each segment allocates overhead to its part of the project but does not allocate segment G&A.; The IR&D; costs are then allocated to the home office by each segment. The costs are combined with other IR&D; costs that benefit the company as a whole. The costs are allocated to all five segments by means of the same base by which the company allocates its residual home office expense costs of all segments. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-40(b), 9904.420-50(e)(2), and 9904.420-50(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Business Unit C normally accounts for its B&P; effort by individual project. It accumulates directly allocated costs and departmental overhead costs by project. The business unit also submits large numbers of bids and proposals whose individual costs of preparation are not material in amount. The business unit collects the cost of these efforts under a single project. Since the cost of preparing each individual bid and proposal is not material, the practice of accumulating these costs in a single project meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Segment D requests that Segment Y provide support for a Segment D IR&D; project. The work being performed by Segment Y is similar in nature to Segment Y's normal product and is not part of its annual IR&D; plan. Segment Y allocates to the project all costs it allocates to other final cost objectives, including G&A; expense. Segment Y then directly transfers the cost of the project to Segment D in accordance with its normal intersegment transfer procedure. The accounting treatment meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(d) and 9904.410.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> Contractor E has six operating segments and a research segment. The research segment performs work under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contractor E has six operating segments and a research segment. The research segment performs work under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Research and development contracts,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Projects which are not part of its own IR&D; plan but are specifically in support of other segments' IR&D; projects, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> IR&D; projects for the benefit of the company as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The research segment directly allocates the cost of the projects in support of another segment's IR&D; projects, including an allocation of its general and administrative expenses, to the receiving segment. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The costs of the IR&D; projects which benefit the company as a whole exclude any allocation of the research segment's general and administrative expenses and are transferred to the home office. The home office allocates these costs on the same base it uses to allocate its residual expenses to all seven segments. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-50 (e)(2) and (f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Company F accumulates at the home office the costs of IR&D; and B&P; projects which generally benefit all segments of the company except Segment X. The company and the contracting officer agree that the nature of the business activity of Segment X is such that the home office IR&D; and B&P; effort is neither caused by nor provides any benefit to that segment. For the purpose of allocating its home office residual expenses, the company uses a base as provided in 9904.403. For the purpose of allocating the home office IR&D; and B&P; costs, the company removes the data of Segment X from the base used for the allocation of its residual expenses. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Company G has 10 segments. Segment X performs IR&D; projects, the results of which benefit it and two other segments but none of the other seven segments. The cost of those projects performed by Segment X are transferred to the home office and allocated to the three segments on the basis of

the benefits received by the three segments. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(e)(1) and 9904.420-50(f)(1).
