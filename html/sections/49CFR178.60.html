                                Sec. 178.60  Specification 8AL steel cylinders with porous fillings
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Type and service pressure. A DOT 8AL cylinder is a seamless  steel cylinder with a service pressure of 250 psig. However, the  attachment of heads by welding or by brazing by dipping process and a  welded circumferential body seam is authorized. Longitudinal seams are  not authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorized steel. The authorized steel is as specified in table  I of appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification of steel. Material must be identified by any  suitable method except that plates and billets for hot-drawn cylinders  must be marked with heat number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and  processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the  requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to  weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and  uniform surface finish is required. Welding procedures and operators  must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Footrings. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long  must be protected by footrings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Welding or brazing. Welding or brazing for any purpose  whatsoever is prohibited except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The attachment to the tops or bottoms of cylinders of neckrings,  footrings, handlers, bosses, pads, and valve protecting rings is  authorized provided that such attachments and the portion of the  container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the  carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Heat treatment is not required after welding or brazing weldable  low carbon parts to attachments, specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this  section, of similar material which have been previously welded or brazed  to the top or bottom of cylinders and properly heat treated, provided  such subsequent welding or brazing does not produce a temperature in  excess of 400 F in any part of the top or bottom material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Wall thickness; wall stress. The wall thickness/wall stress of  the cylinder must conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The calculated wall stress at 750 psi may not exceed 35,000 psi,  or one-half of the minimum ultimate strength of the steel as determined  in paragraph (l) of this section, whichever value is the smaller. The  measured wall thickness may not include galvanizing or other protective  coating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculation of wall stress must be made by the formula:  S = [P(1.3D\2\ + 0.4d\2\)] / (D\2\ - d\2\)  Where:  S = wall stress in pounds psi; P = 750 psig (minimum test pressure); D = outside diameter in inches; d = inside diameter in inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Either D or d must be calculated from the relation D = d + 2t,  where t = minimum wall thickness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cylinders with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch, the ratio  of straight side wall length to outside diameter may not exceed 3.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For cylinders having outside diameter over 5 inches, the minimum  wall thickness must be 0.087 inch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Heat treatment. Each cylinder must be uniformly and properly  heat treated, prior to tests, by any suitable method in excess of 1100  F. Heat treatment must be accomplished after all forming and welding  operations, except that when brazed joints are used, heat treatment must  follow any forming and welding operations but may be done before,  during, or after the brazing operations. Liquid quenching is not  authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Openings. Standard taper pipe threads required in all openings.  The length of the opening may not be less than as specified for American  Standard pipe threads; tapped to gauge; clean cut, even, and without  checks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a  hydrostatic test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method,  operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit  reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit  reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1  cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and  sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure  applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not  exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of  total volumetric expansion at test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> One cylinder out of each lot of 200 or less must be  hydrostatically tested to at least 750 psig. Cylinders not so tested  must be examined under pressure of between 500 and 600 psig and show no  defect. If a hydrostatically tested cylinder fails, each cylinder in the  lot may be hydrostatically tested and those passing are acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Leakage test. Cylinders with bottoms closed in by spinning must  be leakage tested by setting the interior air or gas pressure at not  less than the service pressure. Any cylinder that leaks must be  rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Physical test. A physical test must be conducted as follows;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test is required on 2 specimens cut longitudinally from 1  cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less,  after heat treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specimens must conform to a gauge length of 8 inches with a  width not over 1\1/2\ inches, a gauge length 2 inches with a width not  over 1\1/2\ inches,   or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6  times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over \3/16\  inch thick.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding  to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The yield strength must be determined by either the ``offset''  method or the ``extension under load'' method as prescribed in ASTM E 8  (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In using the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain  (or ``extension under load'') corresponding to the stress at which the  0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient  accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under  appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length.  Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of  30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain  diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2  offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must  be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain  indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed \1/8\  inch per minute during yield strength determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Elongation. Physical test specimens must show at least a 40  percent elongation for a 2 inch gauge length or at least a 20 percent  elongation in other cases. Except that these elongation percentages may  be reduced numerically by 2 for 2 inch specimens and 1 in other cases  for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 50,000 psi to a  maximum of four such increments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Weld tests. Specimens taken across the circumferentially welded  seam must be cut from one cylinder taken at random from each lot of 200  or less cylinders after heat treatment and must pass satisfactorily the  following tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tensile test. A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each  lot of 200 or less, or welded test plate. The specimen must be taken  from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance  with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this  specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two  additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested.  If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the  entire lot represented must be rejected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guided bend test. A root bend test specimen must be cut from the  cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in  paragraph (n)(1) of this section. Specimens must be prepared and tested  in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternate guided-bend test. This test may be used and must be as  required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the  elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld,  between the lightly scribed gage lines-a to b, must be at least 20  percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a  tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (m)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is  authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests  to be acceptable. Repair by welding is authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Porous filling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cylinders must be filled with a porous  material in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The porous material may not disintegrate or sag when wet with  solvent or when subjected to normal service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The filling material must be uniform in quality and free of  voids, except that a well drilled into the filling material beneath the  valve is authorized if the well is filled with a material of such type  that the functions of the filling material are not impaired;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overall shrinkage of the filling material is authorized if the  total clearance between the cylinder shell and filling material, after  solvent has   been added, does not exceed \1/2\ of 1 percent of the respective  diameter or length but not to exceed \1/8\ inch, measured diametrically  and longitudinally;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling  material;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The installed filling material must meet the requirements of CGA  C-12 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Porosity of filling material may not exceed 80 percent except  that filling material with a porosity of up to 92 percent may be used  when tested with satisfactory results in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C- 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the porosity of each cylinder is not known, a cylinder  taken at random from a lot of 200 or less must be tested for porosity.  If the test cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be tested  individually and those cylinders that pass the test are acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For filling that is molded and dried before insertion in  cylinders, porosity test may be made on sample block taken at random  from material to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The porosity of the filling material must be determined; the  amount of solvent at 70 F for a cylinder:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Having shell volumetric capacity above 20 pounds water capacity  (nominal) may not exceed the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Maximum acetone solvent</p><p class="depth4">Percent porosity of filler             percent shell capacity</p><p class="depth4">by volume ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 90 to 92.......................................                     43.4 87 to 90.......................................                     42.0 83 to 87.......................................                     40.0 80 to 83.......................................                     38.6 75 to 80.......................................                     36.2 70 to 75.......................................                     33.8 65 to 70.......................................                     31.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having volumetric capacity of 20 pounds or less water capacity  (nominal), may not exceed the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Maximum acetone solvent</p><p class="depth4">Percent porosity of filler             percent shell capacity</p><p class="depth4">by volume ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 90 to 92.......................................                     41.8 83 to 90.......................................                     38.5 80 to 83.......................................                     37.1 75 to 80.......................................                     34.8 70 to 75.......................................                     32.5 65 to 70.......................................                     30.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Tare weight. The tare weight is the combined weight of the  cylinder proper, porous filling, valve, and solvent, but without  removable cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Duties of inspector. In addition to the requirements of  Sec. 178.35, the inspector shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certify chemical analyses of steel used, signed by manufacturer  thereof; also verify by check analyses, of samples taken from each heat  or from 1 out of each lot of 200 or less plates, shells, or tubes used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verify compliance of cylinder shells with all shell  requirements, inspect inside before closing in both ends, verify heat  treatment as proper; obtain all samples for all tests and for check  analyses, witness all tests; verify threads by gauge, report volumetric  capacity and minimum thickness of wall noted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Report percentage of each specified alloying element in the  steel.
