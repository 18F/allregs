Certain limitations on reporting apply in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable manufacturers for whom total (gross) revenues from covered drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies constituted less than 10 percent of total (gross) revenue during the fiscal year preceding the reporting year are only required to report payments or other transfers of value that are related to one or more covered drugs, devices, biologicals or medical supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable manufacturers under paragraph (2) of the definition in Sec. 403.902 are only required to report payments or other transfers of value that are related to a covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply for which they provided assistance or support to an applicable manufacturer under paragraph (1) of the definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable manufacturers under either paragraph (1) or (2) of the definition in Sec. 403.902 that have separate operating divisions that do not manufacture any covered drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies (for example, animal health divisions) are only required to report payments to covered recipients related to the activities of these separate divisions if those payments or other transfers of value are related to a covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply. This includes reporting of payments or other transfers of value that are related to covered drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies made by applicable manufacturers to covered recipients through these operating divisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicable manufacturers that do not manufacture a covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply except when under a written agreement to manufacture the covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply for another entity, do not hold the FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for the covered drug, device, biological, or

medical supply, and are not involved in the sale, marketing, or distribution of the product, are only required to report payments or other transfers of value that are related to one or more covered drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required information to report.

In the case of a covered recipient who is a physician, the following identifiers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The specialty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> National Provider Identifier (if applicable and as listed in the NPPES). If a National Provider Identifier cannot be identified for a physician, the field may be left blank, indicating that the applicable manufacturer could not find one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State professional license number(s) (for at least one State where the physician maintains a license), and the State(s) in which the license is held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amount of payment or other transfer of value. A payment or other transfer of value made to a group of covered recipients should be distributed appropriately among the individual covered recipients who requested the payment, on whose behalf the payment was made, or who are intended to benefit from the payment or other transfer of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Date of payment or transfer of value. The date of each payment or other transfer of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For payments or other transfers of value made over multiple dates (rather than as a lump sum), applicable manufacturers may choose whether to report each payment or other transfer of value as separate line item using the dates the payments or other transfers of value were each made, or as a single line item for the total payment or other transfer of value using the first payment date as the reported date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For small payments or other transfers of value reported as a single line item, applicable manufacturers must report the date that the first bundled small payment or other transfer of value was provided to the covered recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Form of payment or transfer of value.

Must indicate whether the payment or other transfer of value was provided to a physician or the immediate family of the physician who holds an ownership or investment interest (as defined Sec. 403.902) in the applicable manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Additional information or context for payment or transfer of value. May provide a statement with additional context for the payment or other transfer of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reporting the form of payment or other transfer of value. An applicable manufacturer must report each payment or transfer of value, or separable part of that payment or transfer of value, as taking one of the following forms of payment that best describes the form of the payment or other transfer of value, or separable part of that payment or other transfer of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash or cash equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In-kind items or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stock option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any other ownership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Dividend, profit or other return on investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reporting the nature of the payment or other transfer of value. (1) General rule. The categories describing the nature of a payment or other transfer of value are mutually exclusive for the purposes of reporting under subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for categorizing natures of payment. An applicable manufacturer must categorize each payment or other transfer of value, or separable part of that payment or transfer of value, with one of the categories listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (xvii) of this section, using the designation that best describes the nature of the payment or other transfer of value, or separable part of that payment or other transfer of value. If a payment or other transfer of value could reasonably be considered as falling within more than one category, the applicable manufacturer should select one category that it deems to most accurately describe the nature of the payment or transfer of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consulting fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at an event other than a continuing education program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Honoraria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Entertainment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Food and beverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Travel and lodging (including the specified destinations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Charitable contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Royalty or license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Current or prospective ownership or investment interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for an unaccredited and non-certified continuing education program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for an accredited or certified continuing education program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> Space rental or facility fees (teaching hospital only).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rules for research payments.
