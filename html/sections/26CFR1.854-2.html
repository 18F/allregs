                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 854(b)(2) provides that the amount that a shareholder may treat as a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals, the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporation, and, in the case of dividends received by individuals before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34, shall not exceed the amount so designated by the company in a written notice to its shareholders mailed not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before Feb. 26, 1964) after the close of the company's taxable year. If, however, the amount so designated by the company in the notice exceeds the amount which may be treated by the shareholder as a dividend for such purposes, the shareholder is limited to the amount as correctly ascertained under section 854(b)(1) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.854-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shareholder of record custodian of certain unit investment trusts. In any case where a notice is mailed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by a regulated investment company with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 8, 1970 to a shareholder of record who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.851-7, the nominee shall furnish each holder of an interest in such trust with a written notice mailed on or before the 55th day following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year. The notice shall designate the holder's proportionate share of the amounts that may be treated as a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals and the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporations shown on the notice received by the nominee

pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. This notice shall include the name and address of the nominee identified as such. This paragraph shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and not later than 45 days following the close of the company's taxable year, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return is to be filed for the taxable year, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this paragraph shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such 45-day period; provided however, if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 45 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph within 30 days of such notice.
