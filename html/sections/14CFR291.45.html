                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each section 41103 all-cargo air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, ``U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data for revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Joint-service operations. The Department may authorize joint-service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Service classes. (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Code                           Type of service------------------------------------------------------------------------F................................

Nonscheduled Military Cargo.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first-class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Air transport traffic and capacity elements. Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment and/or market records as follows:
