                            <p class="depth0">While the guaranteed pay may not cover more than 60 hours, the  contract may guarantee pay for a lesser number of hours. In order for a  contract to qualify as a bona fide contract for an employee whose duties  necessitate irregular hours of work, the number of hours for which pay  is guaranteed must   bear a reasonable relation to the number of hours the employee may be  expected to work. A guaranty of pay for 60 hours to an employee whose  duties necessitate irregular hours of work which can reasonably be  expected to range no higher than 50 hours would not qualify as a bona  fide contract under this section. The rate specified in such a contract  would be wholly fictitious and therefore would not be a ``regular rate''  as discussed above. When the parties enter into a guaranteed pay  contract, therefore, they should determine, as far as possible, the  range of hours the employee is likely to work. In deciding the amount of  the guaranty they should not choose a guaranty of pay to cover the  maximum number of hours which the employee will be likely to work at any  time but should rather select a figure low enough so that it may  reasonably be expected that the rate will be operative in a significant  number of workweeks. In both Walling v. A. H. Belo Co., 316 U.S. 624 and  Walling v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co., 331 U.S. 17 the court  found that the employees did actually exceed the number of hours (60 and  84 respectively) for which pay was guaranteed on fairly frequent  occasions so that the hourly rate stipulated in the contract in each  case was often operative and did actually control the compensation  received by the employees. In cases where the guaranteed number of hours  has not been exceeded in a significant number of workweeks, this fact  will be weighed in the light of all the other facts and circumstances  pertinent to the agreement before reaching a conclusion as to its effect  on the validity of the pay arrangement. By a periodic review of the  actual operation of the contract the employer can determine whether a  stipulated contract rate reasonably expected by the parties to be  operative in a significant number of workweeks is actually so operative  or whether adjustments in the contract are necessary to ensure such an  operative rate.</p>
