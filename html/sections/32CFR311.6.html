Publication in the Federal Register starts a 30-day comment  window which provides the public with an opportunity to submit written  data, views, or arguments to the DPO for consideration before a system  of record is established or modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access to Systems of Records Information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided in the  Privacy Act, records shall be disclosed only to the individual they  pertain to and under whose individual name or identifier they are filed,  unless exempted by the provisions in 32 CFR 310.31. If an individual is  accompanied by a third party, the individual shall be required to  furnish a signed access authorization granting the third party access  according to 32 CFR 310.17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals seeking access to records that pertain to  themselves, and that are filed by name or other personal identifier, may  submit the request in person or by mail, in accordance with these  procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any individual making a request for access to records in person  shall provide personal identification to the appropriate system owner,  as identified in the system of records notice published in the Federal  Register, to   verify the individual's identity according to 32 CFR 310.17.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual making a request for access to records by mail  shall address such request to the OSD/JS FOIA Requester Service Center,  Office of Freedom of Information, 1155 Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301- 1155. To verify his or her identity, the requester shall include either  a signed notarized statement or an unsworn declaration in the format  specified by 32 CFR part 286.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All requests for records shall describe the record sought and  provide sufficient information to enable the material to be located  (e.g., identification of system of records, approximate date it was  initiated, originating organization, and type of document).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All requesters shall comply with the procedures in 32 CFR part  310 for inspecting and/or obtaining copies of requested records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the requester is not satisfied with the response, he or she  may file a written appeal as provided in paragraph (f)(8) of this  section. The requester must provide proof of identity by showing a  driver's license or similar credentials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is no requirement that an individual be given access to  records that are not in a group of records that meet the definition of a  system of records in the Privacy Act. (For an explanation of the  relationship between the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act,  and for guidelines to ensure requesters are given the maximum amount of  information authorized by both Acts, see 32 CFR part 310.17</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Granting access to a record containing personal information  shall not be conditioned upon any requirement that the individual state  a reason or otherwise justify the need to gain access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No verification of identity shall be required of an individual  seeking access to records that are otherwise available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Individuals shall not be denied access to a record in a system  of records about themselves because those records are exempted from  disclosure under 32 CFR part 286. Individuals may only be denied access  to a record in a system of records about themselves when those records  are exempted from the access provisions of 32 CFR 310.26.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Individuals shall not be denied access to their records for  refusing to disclose their Social Security Number (SSN), unless  disclosure of the SSN is required by statute, by regulation adopted  before January 1, 1975, or if the record's filing identifier and only  means of retrieval is by SSN (Privacy Act, note).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to Records or Information Compiled for Law Enforcement  Purposes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests are processed under 32 CFR part 310 and 32 CFR  part 286 to give requesters a greater degree of access to records on  themselves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records (including those in the custody of law enforcement  activities) that have been incorporated into a system of records  exempted from the access conditions of 32 CFR part 310, will be  processed in accordance with 32 CFR 286.12. Individuals shall not be  denied access to records solely because they are in the exempt system.  They will have the same access that they would receive under 32 CFR part  286. (See also 32 CFR 310.17.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records systems exempted from access conditions will be  processed under 32 CFR 310.26 or 32 CFR 286.12, depending upon which  regulation gives the greater degree of access. (See also 32 CFR 310.17.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records systems exempted from access under 32 CFR 310.27 that  are temporarily in the hands of a non-law enforcement element for  adjudicative or personnel actions, shall be referred to the originating  agency. The requester will be informed in writing of this referral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to Illegible, Incomplete, or Partially Exempt Records.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual shall not be denied access to a record or a copy of a  record solely because the physical condition or format of the record  does not make it readily available (e.g., deteriorated state or on  magnetic tape). The document will be prepared as an extract, or it will  be exactly recopied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a portion of the record contains information that is exempt  from access, an extract or summary containing all of the information in  the record that is releasable shall be prepared.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the physical condition of the record makes it necessary to  prepare an extract for release, the extract shall be prepared so that  the requester will understand it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requester shall be informed of all deletions or changes to  records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to Medical Records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medical records shall be  disclosed to the individual and may be transmitted to a medical doctor  named by the individual concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual may be charged reproduction fees for copies or  records as outlined in 32 CFR 310.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amending and Disputing Personal Information in Systems of  Records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Head of a WHS-Serviced Component, or designated  official, shall allow individuals to request amendment to their records  to the extent that such records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or  complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section to ensure that they  are seeking to amend records about themselves and not, inadvertently or  intentionally, the records of others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests shall not be rejected nor required to be resubmitted  unless additional information is essential to process the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The appropriate system manager shall mail a written  acknowledgment to an individual's request to amend a record within 10  workdays after receipt. Such acknowledgment shall identify the request  and may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make  a determination. No acknowledgment is necessary if the request can be  reviewed and processed and if the individual can be notified of  compliance or denial within the 10-day period. Whenever practical, the  decision shall be made within 30 working days. For requests presented in  person, written acknowledgment may be provided at the time the request  is presented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Head of a WHS-Serviced Component, or designated official,  shall promptly take one of three actions on requests to amend the  records:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the WHS-Serviced Component official agrees with any portion  or all of an individual's request, he or she will proceed to amend the  records in accordance with existing statutes, regulations, or  administrative procedures and inform the requester of the action taken  in accordance with 32 CFR 310.19. The WHS-Serviced Component official  shall also notify all previous holders of the record that the amendment  has been made and shall explain the substance of the correction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the WHS-Serviced Component official disagrees with all or  any portion of a request, the individual shall be informed promptly of  the refusal to amend a record, the reason for the refusal, and the  procedure to submit an appeal as described in paragraph (f)(8) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the request for an amendment pertains to a record  controlled and maintained by another Federal agency, the request shall  be referred to the appropriate agency and the requester advised of this.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When personal information has been disputed by the requestor,  the Head of a WHS-Serviced Component, or designated official, shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine whether the requester has adequately supported his or  her claim that the record is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or  incomplete.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limit the review of a record to those items of information that  clearly bear on any determination to amend the record, and shall ensure  that all those elements are present before a determination is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the Head of a WHS-Serviced Component, or designated official,  after an initial review of a request to amend a record, disagrees with  all or any portion of the request to amend a record, he or she shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advise the individual of the denial and the reason for it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inform the individual that he or she may appeal the denial.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the procedures for appealing the denial, including  the name   and address of the official to whom the appeal should be directed.

Where feasible, the notation itself shall be  integral to the record. Where disclosure accounting has been made, the  WHS-Serviced Component shall advise previous recipients that the record  has been disputed and shall provide a copy of the individual's statement  of disagreement in accordance with 32 CFR 310.21.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This statement shall be maintained to permit ready retrieval  whenever the disputed portion of the record is disclosed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When information that is the subject of a statement of  disagreement is subsequently disclosed, the WHS-Serviced Component  designated official shall note which information is disputed and provide  a copy of the individual's statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The WHS-Serviced Component shall include a brief summary of its  reasons for not making a correction when disclosing disputed  information.
