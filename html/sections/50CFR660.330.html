                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Groundfish species taken in open access fisheries will  be managed with cumulative trip limits (see trip limits in Tables 3  (North) and 3 (South) of this subpart), size limits (see Sec.  660.60(h)(5)), seasons (see seasons in Tables 3 (North) and 3 (South) of  this subpart), gear restrictions (see paragraph (b) of this section),  and closed areas (see paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. Sec.  660.70 through 660.79). Unless otherwise specified, a vessel operating  in the open access fishery is subject to,   and must not exceed any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit  for the open access fishery. Cowcod retention is prohibited in all  fisheries and groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception  must adhere to CCA restrictions (see paragraph (d)(11) of this section  and Sec. 660.70). Retention of yelloweye rockfish and canary rockfish  is prohibited in all open access fisheries. For information on the open  access daily/weekly trip limit fishery for sablefish, see Sec. 660.332  of this subpart and the trip limits in Tables 3 (North) and 3 (South) of  this subpart. Open access vessels are subject to daily or weekly  sablefish limits in addition to cumulative limits for each cumulative  limit period. Only one sablefish landing per week may be made in excess  of the daily trip limit and, if the vessel chooses to make a landing in  excess of that daily trip limit, then that is the only sablefish landing  permitted for that week. The trip limit for black rockfish caught with  hook-and-line gear also applies, see paragraph (e) of this section. Open  access vessels that fish with non-groundfish trawl gear or in the salmon  troll fishery north of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. are subject the cumulative  limits and closed areas (except the pink shrimp fishery which is not  subject to RCA restrictions) listed in Tables 3 (North) and 3 (South) of  this subpart. Federal commercial groundfish regulations are not intended  to supersede any more restrictive state commercial groundfish  regulations relating to federally managed groundfish.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gear restrictions. Open access gear includes longline, trap,  pot, hook-and-line (fixed or mobile), setnet (anchored gillnet or  trammel net, which are permissible south of 38[deg] N. lat. only), spear  and non-groundfish trawl gear (trawls used to target non-groundfish  species: pink shrimp or ridgeback prawns, and, south of Pt. Arena, CA  (38[deg]57.50' N. lat.), California halibut or sea cucumbers).  Restrictions for gears used in the open access fisheries are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-groundfish trawl gear. Non-groundfish trawl gear is  generally trawl gear used to target pink shrimp, ridgeback prawn,  California halibut and sea cucumber and is exempt from the limited entry  trawl gear restrictions at Sec. 660.130(b). The following gear  restrictions apply to non-groundfish trawl gear:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bottom trawl gear with a footrope diameter greater than 19  inches (48 cm) (including rollers, bobbins, or other material encircling  or tied along the length of the footrope) is prohibited anywhere in EFH  within the EEZ, as defined by latitude/longitude coordinates at Sec.  660.75. unless such gear is the gear of another vessel that has been  retrieved at sea and made inoperable or stowed in a manner not capable  of being fished. The disposal at sea of such gear is prohibited by Annex  V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From  Ships, 1973 (Annex V of MARPOL 73/78).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fixed gear. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fixed gear (longline, trap or pot, set net and  stationary hook-and-line gear, including commercial vertical hook-and- line gear) must be attended at least once every 7 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Set nets. Fishing for groundfish with set nets is prohibited in  the fishery management area north of 38[deg]00.00' N. lat.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Traps or pots. Traps must have biodegradable escape panels  constructed with 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner  that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the  twine deteriorates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Spears. Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sorting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the requirements at  Sec. 660.12(a)(8) the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may  also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state  landing receipts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For open access vessels, the following species must be sorted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coastwide--widow rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched  rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, black rockfish, blue  rockfish, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope  rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish,  shortspine and longspine thornyhead, Dover sole, arrowtooth flounder,  petrale sole, starry flounder, English sole, other flatfish, lingcod,  sablefish, Pacific cod, spiny dogfish, longnose skate, other   fish, Pacific whiting, and Pacific sanddabs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.--POP, yellowtail rockfish,  cabezon (Oregon and California);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.--minor shallow nearshore  rockfish, minor deeper nearshore rockfish, chilipepper, bocaccio,  splitnose rockfish, cowcod, bronzespotted rockfish, blackgill rockfish  and cabezon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Groundfish conservation areas affecting open access vessels. A  GCA, a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates  expressed in degrees of latitude and longitude. A vessel that is  authorized by this paragraph to fish within a GCA (e.g. fishing for  ``other flatfish'' using no more than 12 hooks, ``Number 2'' or  smaller), may not simultaneously have other gear on board the vessel  that is unlawful to use for fishing within the GCA.

The nontrawl RCAs are closed areas, defined by specific  latitude and longitude coordinates (specified at Sec. Sec. 660.70  through 660.74, subpart C) designed to approximate specific depth  contours, where fishing for groundfish with nontrawl gear is prohibited.  Boundaries for the nontrawl RCA throughout the year are provided in the  open access trip limit tables, Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of  this subpart and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to Sec.  660.60(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is unlawful to operate a vessel in the nontrawl RCA that has  nontrawl gear onboard and is not registered to a limited entry permit on  a trip in which the vessel is used to take and retain or possess  groundfish in the EEZ, or land groundfish taken in the EEZ, except for  the purpose of continuous transiting, or when the use of nontrawl gear  is authorized in part 660.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On any trip on which a groundfish species is taken with  nontrawl open access gear and retained, the open access nontrawl vessel  may transit through the nontrawl RCA only if all groundfish nontrawl  gear is stowed either: Below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be  moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all lines, so that  it is rendered unusable for fishing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nontrawl RCA restrictions in this section apply to vessels  taking and retaining or possessing groundfish in the EEZ, or landing  groundfish taken in the EEZ. Unless otherwise authorized by part 660, a  vessel may not retain any groundfish taken on a fishing trip for species  other than groundfish that occurs within the nontrawl RCA. If a vessel  fishes in a non-groundfish fishery in the nontrawl RCA, it may not  participate in any fishing for groundfish on that trip that is  prohibited within the nontrawl RCA. [For example, if a vessel fishes in  the salmon troll fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot on the same  trip fish in the sablefish fishery outside of the RCA.]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fishing for ``other flatfish'' off California (between 42[deg]  N. lat. south to the U.S./Mexico border) is permitted within the  nontrawl RCA with fixed gear only under the following conditions: When  using no more than 12 hooks, ``Number 2'' or smaller, which measure no  more than 11 mm (0.44 inches) point to shank, and up to two 1-lb (0.91  kg) weights per line when trip limits authorize such fishing; and  provided a valid declaration report as required at Sec. 660.13(d), has  been filed with NMFS OLE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Non-groundfish trawl rockfish conservation areas for the open  access non-groundfish trawl fisheries. The non-groundfish trawl RCAs are  closed areas, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates  (specified at Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.74, subpart C) designed to  approximate specific depth contours, where fishing for groundfish with  nontrawl gear is prohibited. Boundaries for the nontrawl RCA throughout  the year are provided in the open access trip limit tables, Table 3  (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS  in season pursuant to Sec. 660.60(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is unlawful to operate a vessel in the non-groundfish trawl  RCA with non-groundfish trawl gear onboard, except for the purpose of  continuous transiting, or when the use of trawl gear is authorized in  part 660.

Unless otherwise authorized  by Part 660, it is unlawful for a vessel to retain any groundfish taken  on a fishing trip for species other than groundfish that occurs within  the non-groundfish trawl RCA. If a vessel fishes in a non-groundfish  fishery in the non-groundfish trawl RCA, it may not participate in any  fishing on that trip that is prohibited within the non-groundfish trawl  RCA. Nothing in these Federal regulations supersedes any state  regulations that may prohibit trawling shoreward of the fishery  management area (3-200 nm).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> It is lawful to fish with non-groundfish trawl gear within the  non-groundfish trawl RCA only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Pink shrimp trawling is permitted in the non-groundfish trawl  RCA when a valid declaration report as required at Sec. 660.12(d),  subpart C, has been filed with NMFS OLE. Groundfish caught with pink  shrimp trawl gear may be retained anywhere in the EEZ and are subject to  the limits in Table 3 (North) and Table 3 (South) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When the shoreward line of the trawl RCA is shallower than 100  fm (183   m), vessels using ridgeback prawn trawl gear south of 34[deg]27.00[min]  N. lat. may operate out to the 100 fm (183 m) boundary line specified at  Sec. 660.73, when a valid declaration report as required at Sec.  660.13(d), has been filed with NMFS OLE. Groundfish caught with  ridgeback prawn trawl gear are subject to the limits in Table 3 (North)  and Table 3 (South) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Farallon Islands. Under California law, commercial fishing for  all groundfish is prohibited between the shoreline and the 10 fm (18 m)  depth contour around the Farallon Islands. An exception to this  prohibition is that commercial fishing for ``other flatfish'' is  permitted around the Farallon Islands using no more than 12 hooks,  ``Number 2'' or smaller, which measure no more than 11 mm (0.44 inches)  point to shank, and up to two 1-lb (0.45 kg) weights per line. (See  Table 2 (South) of this subpart.) For a definition of the Farallon  Islands, see Sec. 660.70, subpart C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Cordell Banks. Commercial fishing for groundfish is prohibited  in waters of depths less than 100-fm (183-m) around Cordell Banks, as  defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. 660.70,  subpart C.
