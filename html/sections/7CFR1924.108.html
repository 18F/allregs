                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Soil and geologic conditions must be suitable for the  type of construction proposed. In questionable or unsurveyed areas, the  applicant or developer will provide an engineering report with  supporting data sufficient to identify all pertinent subsurface  conditions which could adversely affect the structure and show proposed  solutions. Grading will promote drainage of surface water away from  buildings and foundations, minimize earth settlement and erosion, and  assure that drainage from adjacent properties onto the development or  from the development to adjacent properties does not create a health  hazard or other undesirable conditions. Grading and drainage will comply  with exhibit B, paragraphs III and IV, of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cuts and fills. Development requiring extensive earthwork, cuts  and fills of 4 feet or more shall be designed by a professional  engineer. Where topography requires fills or extensive earthwork that  must support structures and building foundations, these must be  controlled fills designed, supervised, and tested by a qualified soils  engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Slope protection. All slopes must be protected from erosion by  planting or other means. Slopes may require temporary cover if exposed  for long periods during construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Storm water systems. The design of storm water systems must  consider convenience and property protection both at the individual site  level and the drainage basin level. Storm water systems should be  compatible with the natural features of the site. In areas   with inadequate drainage systems, permanent or temporary storm water  storage shall be an integral part of the overall development plan.  Design of these facilities shall consider safety, appearance, and  economical maintenance operations.    Sec. Sec. 1924.109-1924.114  [Reserved]</p>
