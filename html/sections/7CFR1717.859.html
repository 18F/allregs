(1) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that their applications for a lien accommodation or subordination are complete and sound as to substance and form before they are submitted to RUS. RUS will not accept any application that, on its face, is incomplete or inadequate as to the substantive information required by this subpart. RUS will notify borrowers in writing when their applications are complete and in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. A copy of all notifications of borrowers cited in this section will also be sent to the private lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that their applications for a lien accommodation or subordination are complete and sound as to substance and form before they are submitted to RUS. RUS will not accept any application that, on its face, is incomplete or inadequate as to the substantive information required by this subpart.

A copy of all notifications of borrowers cited in this section will also be sent to the private lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is recommended that borrowers consult with RUS staff before submitting their applications to determine whether they will likely qualify for advance approval or normal review, and to obtain answers to any questions about the information and documents required for the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A borrower shall, after submitting an application, promptly notify RUS of any changes that materially affect the information contained in its application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After submitting an application and having been notified by RUS of additional information and documents and other changes needed to complete the application, if the required information and documents are not supplied to RUS within 30 calendar days of the borrower's receipt of the notice, RUS may return the application to the borrower. The borrower may resubmit the application when the required additional information and documents are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Timeframes. The timeframes for review of applications set forth in this section are based on the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The types of lien accommodations or subordinations requested are of the ``standard'' types that RUS has approved previously, i.e., the so-called Type I, II and III lien accommodations. Future revisions of the RUS mortgage may result in other ``standard'' types of lien accommodations and lien subordinations acceptable to RUS. Requests for lien accommodations or subordinations that are substantially different than the ``standard'' types previously approved by RUS may require additional time for review and action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requested lien accommodation or subordination does not require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement. Preparation of these documents often will require additional time beyond the timeframes cited in this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The timeframes set forth in this section, except for paragraph (b)(4) of this section, which deals only with approval of a new mortgage or mortgage amendment, include RUS review and/or approval of a loan contract, if required as part of the application, and required supporting documents, such as a CWP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advance approval--100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities. (1) Applications that qualify under Sec. 1717.854 for advance approval of a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities are submitted to the general field representative (GFR). The GFR will work with the borrower to ensure that all components of the application are assembled. Once the application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office for further review and action. If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, a draft of these documents must be included in the application, unless the borrower has been notified that RUS wishes to prepare the documents itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications that qualify under Sec. 1717.854 for advance approval of a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities are submitted to the general field representative (GFR).
