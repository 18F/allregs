                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The amount of the gift resulting from  any transfer to which section 2701 applies is determined by a  subtraction method of valuation. Under this method, the amount of the  transfer is determined by subtracting the values of all family-held  senior equity interests from the fair market value of all family-held  interests in the entity determined immediately before the transfer. The  values of the senior equity interests held by the transferor and  applicable family members generally are determined under section 2701.  Other family-held senior equity interests are valued at their fair  market value. The balance is then appropriately allocated among the  transferred interests and other family-held subordinate equity  interests. Finally, certain discounts and other appropriate reductions  are provided, but only to the extent permitted by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Senior equity interest. Senior equity interest means an equity  interest in the entity that carries a right to distributions of income  or capital that is preferred as to the rights of the transferred  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subordinate equity interest. Subordinate equity interest means  an equity interest in the entity as to which an applicable retained  interest is a senior equity interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation methodology. The following methodology is used to  determine the amount of the gift when section 2701 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step 1--Valuation of family-held interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section determine the  fair market value of all family-held equity interests in the entity  immediately after the transfer. The fair market value is determined by  assuming that the interests are held by one individual, using a  consistent set of assumptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for contributions to capital. In the case of a  contribution to   capital, determine the fair market value of the contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2--Subtract the value of senior equity interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If the amount determined in Step 1 of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section is not determined under the special rule for contributions to  capital, from that value subtract the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An amount equal to the sum of the fair market value of all  family-held senior equity interests, (other than applicable retained  interests held by the transferor or applicable family members) and the  fair market value of any family-held equity interests of the same class  or a subordinate class to the transferred interests held by persons  other than the transferor, members of the transferor's family, and  applicable family members of the transferor. The fair market value of an  interest is its pro rata share of the fair market value of all family- held senior equity interests of the same class (determined, immediately  after the transfer, as is all family-held senior equity interests were  held by one individual); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The value of all applicable retained interests held by the  transferor or applicable family members (other than an interest received  as consideration for the transfer) determined under Sec. 25.2701-2,  taking into account the adjustment described in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for contributions to capital. If the value  determined in Step 1 of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is determined  under the special rule for contributions to capital, subtract the value  of any applicable retained interest received in exchange for the  contribution to capital determined under Sec. 25.2701-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2--Subtract the value of senior equity interests. From the  value determined in Step 1, subtract the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount equal to the fair market value of all family-held  senior equity interests, other than applicable retained interests held  by the transferor or applicable family members. The fair market value of  an interest is its pro rata share of the fair market value of all  family-held senior equity interests of the same class (determined as if  all family-held senior equity interests were held by one individual);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value of all applicable retained interests held by the  transferor or applicable family members determined under Sec. 25.2701- 2, taking into account the adjustment described in paragraph (b)(5) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 3--Allocate the remaining value among the transferred  interests and other family-held subordinate equity interests. The value  remaining after Step 2 is allocated among the transferred interests and  other subordinate equity interests held by the transferor, applicable  family members, and members of the transferor's family. If more than one  class of family-held subordinate equity interest exists, the value  remaining after Step 2 is allocated, beginning with the most senior  class of subordinate equity interest, in the manner that would most  fairly approximate their value if all rights valued under section 2701  at zero did not exist (or would be exercised in a manner consistent with  the assumptions of the rule of Sec. 25.2702-2(a)(4), if applicable). If  there is no clearly appropriate method of allocating the remaining value  pursuant to the preceding sentence, the remaining value (or the portion  remaining after any partial allocation pursuant to the preceding  sentence) is allocated to the interests in proportion to their fair  market values determined without regard to section 2701.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 4--Determine the amount of the gift--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The  amount allocated to the transferred interests in Step 3 is reduced by  the amounts determined under this paragraph (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduction for minority or similar discounts. Except as provided  in Sec. 25.2701-3(c), if the value of the transferred interest  (determined without regard to section 2701) would be determined after  application of a minority or similar discount with respect to the  transferred interest, the amount of the gift determined under section  2701 is reduced by the excess, if any, of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A pro rata portion of the fair market value of the family-held  interests of the same class (determined as if all voting rights  conferred by family-held equity interests were held by one person who  had no interest in the entity other than the family-held interests   of the same class, but otherwise without regard to section 2701), over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The value of the transferred interest (without regard to section  2701).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustment for transfers with a retained interest. If the  value of the transferor's gift (determined without regard to section  2701) would be reduced under section 2702 to reflect the value of a  retained interest, the value determined under section 2701 is reduced by  the same amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reduction for consideration. The amount of the transfer  (determined under section 2701) is reduced by the amount of  consideration in money or money's worth received by the transferor, but  not in excess of the amount of the gift (determined without regard to  section 2701). The value of consideration received by the transferor in  the form of an applicable retained interest in the entity is determined  under section 2701 except that, in the case of a contribution to  capital, the Step 4 value of such an interest is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjustment in Step 2--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, if the percentage of any class of applicable  retained interest held by the transferor and by applicable family  members (including any interest received as consideration for the  transfer) exceeds the family interest percentage, the excess is treated  as a family-held interest that is not held by the transferor or an  applicable family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Family interest percentage. The family interest percentage is  the highest ownership percentage (determined on the basis of relative  fair market values) of family-held interests in--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any class of subordinate equity interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All subordinate equity interests, valued in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum value rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If section 2701 applies to  the transfer of an interest in an entity, the value of a junior equity  interest is not less than its pro-rata portion of 10 percent of the sum  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total value of all equity interests in the entity, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total amount of any indebtedness of the entity owed to the  transferor and applicable family members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Junior equity interest. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, junior equity interest means common stock or, in the case of a  partnership, any partnership interest under which the rights to income  and capital are junior to the rights of all other classes of partnership  interests. Common stock means the class or classes of stock that, under  the facts and circumstances, are entitled to share in the reasonably  anticipated residual growth in the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indebtedness--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)  of this section, indebtedness owed to the transferor (or an applicable  family member) does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Short-term indebtedness incurred with respect to the current  conduct of the entity's trade or business (such as amounts payable for  current services);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Indebtedness owed to a third party solely because it is  guaranteed by the transferor or an applicable family member; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amounts permanently set aside in a qualified deferred  compensation arrangement, to the extent the amounts are unavailable for  use by the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Leases. A lease of property is not indebtedness, without regard  to the length of the lease term, if the lease payments represent full  and adequate consideration for use of the property. Lease payments are  considered full and adequate consideration if a good faith effort is  made to determine the fair rental value under the lease and the terms of  the lease conform to the value so determined. Arrearages with respect to  a lease are indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of the subtraction method described in  this section is illustrated by the following Examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X has outstanding 1,000 shares of $1,000 par  value voting preferred stock, each share of which carries a cumulative  annual dividend of 8 percent and a right to put the stock to X for its  par value at any time. In addition, there are outstanding 1,000 shares  of non-voting common stock. A holds 600 shares of the preferred stock  and 750 shares of the common stock. The balance of the preferred and  common stock is held by B, a person unrelated to A. Because the  preferred stock confers both a   qualified payment right and an extraordinary payment right, A's rights  are valued under the ``lower of'' rule of Sec. 25.2701-2(a)(3). Assume  that A's rights in the preferred stock are valued at $800 per share  under the ``lower of'' rule (taking account of A's voting rights). A  transfers all of A's common stock to A's child. The method for  determining the amount of A's gift is as follows--</p><p class="depth0">Step l: Assume the fair market value of all the family-held  interests in X, taking account of A's control of the corporation, is  determined to be $1 million.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2: From the amount determined under Step l, subtract $480,000  (600 shares x $800 (the section 2701 value of A's preferred stock,  computed under the ``lower of'' rule of Sec. 25.2701-2(a)(3))).</p><p class="depth0">Step 3: The result of Step 2 is a balance of $520,000. This amount  is fully allocated to the 750 shares of family-held common stock.</p><p class="depth0">3Step 4: Because no consideration was furnished for the transfer,  the adjustment under Step 4 is limited to the amount of any appropriate  minority or similar discount. Before the application of Step 4 the  amount of A's gift is $520,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that prior  to the transfer A holds only 50 percent of the common stock and B holds  the remaining 50 percent. Assume that the fair market value of A's 600  shares of preferred stock is $600,000.</p><p class="depth0">Step 1: Assume that the result of this step (determining the value  of the family-held interest) is $980,000.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2: From the amount determined under Step 1, subtract $500,000  ($400,000, the value of 500 shares of A's preferred stock determined  without regard to section 2701 pursuant to the valuation adjustment  determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section). The adjustment in  step 2 applies in this example because A's percentage ownership of the  preferred stock (60 percent) exceeds the family interest percentage of  the common stock (50 percent). Therefore, 100 shares of A's preferred  stock are valued at fair market value, or $100,000 (100 x $1,000). The  balance of A's preferred stock is valued under section 2701 at $400,000  (500 shares x $800). The value of A's preferred stock for purposes of  section 2701 equals $500,000 ($100,000 plus $400,000).</p><p class="depth0">Step 3: The result of Step 2 is $480,000 ($980,000 minus $500,000)  which is allocated to the family-held common stock. Because A  transferred all of the family-held subordinate equity interests, all of  the value determined under Step 2 is allocated to the transferred  shares. Step 4: The adjustment under Step 4 is the same as in Example  1.Thus, the amount of the gift is $480,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation X has outstanding 1,000 shares of $1,000 par  value non-voting preferred stock, each share of which carries a  cumulative annual dividend of 8 percent and a right to put the stock to  X for its par value at any time. In addition, there are outstanding  1,000 shares of voting common stock. A holds 600 shares of the preferred  stock and 750 shares of the common stock. The balance of the preferred  and common stock is held by B, a person unrelated to A. Assume further  that steps one through three, as in Example 1, result in $520,000 being  allocated to the family-held common stock and that A transfers only 75  shares of A's common stock. The transfer fragments A's voting interest.  Under Step 4, an adjustment is appropriate to reflect the fragmentation  of A's voting rights. The amount of the adjustment is the difference  between 10 percent (75/750) of the fair market value of A's common  shares and the fair market value of the transferred shares, each  determined as if the holder thereof had no other interest in the  corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On December 31, 1990, the capital structure of Y  corporation consists of 1,000 shares of voting common stock held three- fourths by A and one-fourth by A's child, B. On January 15, 1991, A  transfers 250 shares of common stock to Y in exchange for 300 shares of  nonvoting, noncumulative 8% preferred stock with a section 2701 value of  zero. Assume that the fair market value of Y is $1,000,000 at the time  of the exchange and that the exchange by A is for full and adequate  consideration in moneys' worth. However, for purposes of section 2701,  if a subordinate equity interest is transferred in exchange for an  applicable retained interest, consideration in the exchange is  determined with reference to the section 2701 value of the senior  interest. Thus, A is treated as transferring the common stock to the  corporation for no consideration. Immediately after the transfer, B is  treated as holding one-third (250/750) of the common stock and A is  treated as holding two-thirds (500/750). The amount of the gift is  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1. Because Y is held exclusively by A and B, the Step 1 value  is $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2. The result of Step 2 is $1,000,000 ($1,000,000 - 0).</p><p class="depth0">Step 3. The amount allocated to the transferred common stock is  $250,000 (250/1,000 x $1,000,000). That amount is further allocated in  proportion to the respective holdings of A and B in the common stock  ($166,667 and $83,333, respectively).</p><p class="depth0">Step 4. There is no Step 4 adjustment because the section 2701 value  of the consideration received by A was zero and no minority discount  would have been involved in the exchange. Thus, the amount of the gift  is $83,333. If the section 2701 value of the applicable retained  interested were $100,000, the Step 4 adjustment would have been a  $33,333 reduction for consideration received ((250/750)x$100,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that on  January 6, 1992, when   the fair market value of Y is still $1,000,000, A transfers A's  remaining 500 shares of common stock to Y in exchange for 2500 shares of  preferred stock. The second transfer is also for full and adequate  consideration in money or money's worth. The result of Step 2 is the  same--$1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0">Step 3. The amount allocated to the transferred common stock is  $666,667 (500/750 x $1,000,000). Since A holds no common stock  immediately after the transfer, A is treated as transferring the entire  interest to the other shareholder (B). Thus, $666,667 is fully allocated  to the shares held by B.</p><p class="depth0">Step 4. There is no Step 4 adjustment because the section 2701 value  of the consideration received by A was zero and no minority discount  would have been involved in the exchange. Thus, the amount of the gift  is $666,667.  [T.D. 8395, 57 FR 4259, Feb. 4, 1992; T.D. 8395, 57 FR 11264, Apr. 2,  1992]</p>
