                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Firefighting vehicles. Notwithstanding the effective date  provisions of the motor vehicle safety standards in this part, the  effective date of any standard or amendment of a standard issued after  September 1, 1971, to which firefighting vehicles must conform shall be,  with respect to such vehicles, either 2 years after the date on which  such standard or amendment is published in the rules and regulations  section of the Federal Register, or the effective date specified in the  notice, whichever is later, except as such standard or amendment may  otherwise specifically provide with respect to firefighting vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicles built in two or more stages vehicles and altered  vehicles. Unless Congress directs or the agency expressly determines  that this paragraph does not apply, the date for manufacturer  certification of compliance with any standard, or amendment to a  standard, that is issued on or after September 1, 2006 is, insofar as  its application to intermediate and final-stage manufacturers and  alterers is concerned, one year after the last applicable date for  manufacturer certification of compliance. Nothing in this provision  shall be construed as prohibiting earlier compliance with the standard  or amendment or as precluding NHTSA from extending a compliance  effective date for intermediate and final-stage manufacturers and  alterers by more than one year.
