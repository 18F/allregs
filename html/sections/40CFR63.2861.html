                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">After the initial notifications, you must submit the reports in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to the agency responsible for these NESHAP at the appropriate time intervals:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual compliance certifications. The first annual compliance certification is due 12 calendar months after

you submit the notification of compliance status. Each subsequent annual compliance certification is due 12 calendar months after the previous annual compliance certification. The annual compliance certification provides the compliance status for each operating month during the 12 calendar months period ending 60 days prior to the date on which the report is due. Include the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section in the annual certification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The physical address of the vegetable oil production process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each listed oilseed type processed during the 12 calendar months period covered by the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each HAP identified under Sec. 63.2854(a) as being present in concentrations greater than 1 percent by volume in each delivery of solvent received during the 12 calendar months period covered by the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement designating the source as a major source of HAP or a demonstration that the source qualifies as an area source. An area source is a source that is not a major source and is not collocated within a plant site with other sources that are individually or collectively a major source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A compliance certification to indicate whether the source was in compliance for each compliance determination made during the 12 calendar months period covered by the report. For each such compliance determination, you must include a certification of the items in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) through (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are following the procedures described in the plan for demonstrating compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compliance ratio is less than or equal to 1.00.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deviation notification report. Submit a deviation report for each compliance determination you make in which the compliance ratio exceeds 1.00 as determined under Sec. 63.2840(c). Submit the deviation report by the end of the month following the calendar month in which you determined the deviation. The deviation notification report must include the items in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The physical address of the vegetable oil production process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each listed oilseed type processed during the 12 operating months period for which you determined the deviation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The compliance ratio comprising the deviation. You may reduce the frequency of submittal of the deviation notification report if the agency responsible for these NESHAP does not object as provided in Sec. 63.10(e)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. If you choose to operate your source under an initial startup period subject to Sec. 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2) or a malfunction period subject to Sec. 63.2850(e)(2), you must submit a periodic SSM report by the end of the calendar month following each month in which the initial startup period or malfunction period occurred. The periodic SSM report must include the items in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, title, and signature of a source's responsible official who is certifying that the report accurately states that all actions taken during the initial startup or malfunction period were consistent with the SSM plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of events occurring during the time period, the date and duration of the events, and reason the time interval qualifies as an initial startup period or malfunction period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the solvent loss during the initial startup or malfunction period with supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Immediate SSM reports. If you handle a SSM during an initial startup period subject to Sec. 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2) or a malfunction period subject to Sec. 63.2850(e)(2) differently from procedures in the SSM plan and the relevant emission requirements in Sec. 63.2840 are exceeded, then you must submit an immediate SSM report. Immediate SSM reports consist of a telephone call or facsimile transmission to the responsible agency within 2 working days after starting actions inconsistent with the SSM plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event. The letter must include the

items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, title, and signature of a source's responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report, an explanation of the event, and the reasons for not following the SSM plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description and date of the SSM event, its duration, and reason it qualifies as a SSM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the solvent loss for the duration of the SSM event with supporting documentation.
