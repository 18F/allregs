                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. CMRS operators are required, prior to commencing  operations on fixed or base station transmitters   on the 776-787 MHz band that are located within 500 meters of existing  or planned public safety base station receivers, to submit a description  of their proposed facility to a Commission-approved public safety  coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The frequency or frequencies on which the facility will operate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Antenna location and height;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Type of emission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective radiated power;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A description of the area served and the operator's name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is the CMRS operator's responsibility to determine whether  referral is required for stations constructed in its area of license.  Public safety base stations are considered ``planned'' when public  safety operators have notified, or initiated coordination with, a  Commission-approved public safety coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> CMRS operators must wait at least 10 business days after  submission of the required description before commencing operations on  the referenced facility, or implementing modifications to an existing  facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The potential for harmful interference between the CMRS and  public safety facilities will be evaluated by the public safety  coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With regard to existing public safety facilities, the  coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed CMRS facility (or  modification) to be located within 500 meters of the public safety  facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator may seek  Commission review of such determinations. Pending Commission review, the  CMRS operator will not activate the facility or implement proposed  modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With regard to proposed public safety facilities, the  coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed CMRS facility (or  modification) to be located within 500 meters of the public safety  facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator may seek  Commission review and, pending completion of review, operate the  facility during construction of the public safety facilities. If  coordination or Commission review has not been completed when the public  safety facilities are ready to operate, the CMRS operator must cease  operations pending completion of coordination or Commission review. Such  interim operation of the CMRS facility within the coordination zone (or  implementation of modifications) will not be relied on by the Commission  in its subsequent review and determination of measures necessary to  control interference, including relocation or modification of the CMRS  facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, in the event of harmful interference between facilities  located within 500 meters proximity, the parties are unable, with the  involvement of the coordinator, to resolve the problem by mutually  satisfactory arrangements, the Commission may impose restrictions on the  operations of any of the parties involved.
