                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A CDC may apply to make a 504 loan for a Project outside its Area of Operations to the District Office serving the area in which the Project will be located. The applicant CDC must demonstrate that it can adequately fulfill its 504 program responsibilities for the 504 loan, including proper servicing. In addition, the CDC must have satisfactory SBA performance, as determined by SBA in its discretion. The CDC's Risk Rating, among other factors, will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, on-site review/examination assessments, historical performance measures (like default rate, purchase rate and loss rate), loan volume to the extent that it impacts performance measures, and other performance related measurements and information (such as contribution toward SBA mission). The District Office may approve the application if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The applicant CDC has previously assisted the business to obtain a 504 loan; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The existing CDC or CDCs serving the area agree to permit the applicant CDC to make the 504 loan; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There is no CDC within the Area of Operations.
