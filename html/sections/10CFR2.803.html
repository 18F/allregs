(1) The NRC will evaluate the petition for rulemaking, including supporting data or information submitted under Sec. 2.802(c), for sufficiency according to the review criteria in Sec. 2.803(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the NRC determines that the petition for rulemaking does not include the information set out in Sec. 2.802(c), that the regulatory change sought by the petitioner is not within the legal authority of the NRC, or that the petition for rulemaking does not raise a potentially valid issue that warrants further consideration, then the NRC will notify the petitioner in writing and explain the deficiencies in the petition for rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The petitioner may resubmit the petition for rulemaking without prejudice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Docketing. (1) The NRC will docket a petition for rulemaking and assign a docket number to the petition if the NRC determines the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The petition for rulemaking includes the information required by paragraph Sec. 2.802(c),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The regulatory change sought by the petitioner is within the NRC's legal authority, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The petition for rulemaking raises a potentially valid issue that warrants further consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the docketed petition for rulemaking will be posted in the NRC's Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) and on the Federal rulemaking Web site at: http://www.regulations.gov. The NRC will publish a notice of docketing in the Federal Register informing the public that the NRC is reviewing the merits of the petition for rulemaking. The notice of docketing will include the docket number and explain how the public may track the status of the petition for rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> NRC communication with petitioners. If the petition is signed by multiple petitioners, any NRC obligation to inform a petitioner (as may be required under 10 CFR part 2, subpart H) is satisfied, with respect to all petitioners, when the NRC transmits the required notification to the lead petitioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)-(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Public comment on a petition for rulemaking; hearings. (1) At its discretion, the NRC may request public comment on a docketed petition for rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The NRC will post all comment submissions at http://www.regulations.gov and enter the comment submissions into ADAMS, without removing identifying or contact information from comment submissions. Anyone requesting or aggregating comments from other persons for submission to the NRC is responsible for informing those persons not to include identifying or contact information that they do not want to be publicly disclosed in their comment submissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No adjudicatory or legislative hearing under the procedures of 10 CFR part 2 will be held on a petition for rulemaking unless the Commission determines to do so, at its discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Determination on a petition for rulemaking; Closure of docket on a petition for rulemaking. (1) Determination. Following docketing of a petition for rulemaking, the NRC's determination on the petition for rulemaking may be based upon, but is not limited to, the following considerations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The merits of the petition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The immediacy of the safety, environmental, or security concern raised;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The availability of NRC resources and the priority of the issues raised in relation to other NRC rulemaking issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the problems or issues are already under consideration by the NRC in other NRC processes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The substance of any public comment received, if comment is requested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The NRC's relevant past decisions and current policies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Petition for rulemaking docket closure. After the NRC determines the appropriate regulatory action in response to the petition for rulemaking, the NRC will administratively close the docket for the petition. The NRC will publish a notice describing that action with any related Docket Identification number (Docket ID), as applicable, in the Federal Register. The NRC may make a determination on a petition for rulemaking and administratively close the docket for the petition for rulemaking by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deciding not to undertake a rulemaking to address the issue raised by the petition for rulemaking, and informing the petitioner in writing of the grounds for denial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initiating a rulemaking action (e.g., initiating a new rulemaking, addressing the petition for rulemaking in an ongoing rulemaking, addressing the petition for rulemaking in a planned rulemaking) that considers the issues raised by a petition for rulemaking, and informing the petitioner in writing of this decision and the associated Docket ID of the rulemaking action, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Petition for rulemaking resolution.--(1) Petition for rulemaking resolution published in the Federal Register. The NRC will publish a Federal Register notice informing the public that it has concluded all planned regulatory action with respect to some or all of the issues presented in a petition for rulemaking. This may occur by adoption of a final rule related to the petition for rulemaking, denial by the NRC of the petition for rulemaking at any stage of the regulatory process, or the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition for rulemaking before the NRC has entered the rulemaking process. As applicable, the Federal Register notice will include a discussion of how the regulatory action addresses the issue raised by the petitioner, the NRC's grounds for denial of the petition for rulemaking, or information on the withdrawal. The notice will normally include the NRC's response to any public comment received (if comment is requested), unless the NRC has indicated that it will not be providing a formal written response to each comment received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NRC decision not to proceed with rulemaking after closure of a petition for rulemaking docket. If the NRC closes a petition for rulemaking docket under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section but subsequently decides not to carry out the planned rulemaking to publication of a final rule, the NRC will notify the petitioner in writing of this decision and publish a notice in the Federal Register explaining the basis for its

decision. The decision not to complete the rulemaking action will be documented as denial of the petition for rulemaking in the docket of the closed petition for rulemaking, in the Web sites, in the Government-wide Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, online in ADAMS, and at http://www.regulations.gov as described in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Status of petitions for rulemaking and rulemakings.
