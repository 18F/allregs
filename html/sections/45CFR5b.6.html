A subject individual will be granted direct access to a medical record if the responsible official determines that direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual. If the responsible Department official believes that he is not qualified to determine, or if he does determine, that direct access to the subject individual is likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual, the record will be sent to the designated representative. The subject individual will be informed in writing that the record has been sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medical records of minors--(1) Requests by minors; notification of or access to medical records to minors.

A parent or guardian shall at the time he makes a request designate a family physician or other health professional (other than a family member) to whom the record, if any, will be sent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where a medical record on the minor exists, it will be sent to the physician or health professional designated by the parent or guardian in all cases. If disclosure of the record would constitute an invasion of the minor's privacy, that fact will be brought to the attention of the physician or health professional to whom the record is sent. The physician or health professional will be asked to consider the effect that disclosure of the record to the parent or guardian would have on the minor in determining whether the minor's medical record should be made available to the parent or guardian. Response to the parent or guardian making the request will be made in substantially the following form:
We have completed processing your request for notification of or access to______________________________________________________________________

medical records. Please be informed that if any medical record were found pertaining to that individual, they have not been sent to your designated physician or health professional.

In each case where a minor's medical record is sent to a physician or health professional, reasonable efforts will be made to so inform the minor.</p>
