                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A euthyscope is a device that is a modified AC- powered or battery-powered ophthalmoscope (a perforated mirror device  intended to inspect the interior of the eye) that projects a bright  light encompassing an arc of about 30 degrees onto the fundus of the  eye. The center of the light bundle is blocked by a black disk covering  the fovea (the central depression of the macular retinae where only  cones are present and blood vessels are lacking). The device is intended  for use in the treatment of amblyopia (dimness of vision without  apparent disease of the eye).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I for the battery powered device. The  battery powered device is exempt from the premarket notification  procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter, subject to the  limitations in Sec. 886.9. Class II for the AC-powered device.  [55 FR 48441, Nov. 20, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 63012, Dec. 7, 1994; 66  FR 38810, July 25, 2001]</p>
