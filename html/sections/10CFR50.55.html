However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will extend the completion date for a reasonable period of time. The Commission will recognize, among other things, developmental problems attributable to the experimental nature of the facility or fire, flood, explosion, strike, sabotage, domestic violence, enemy action, an act of the elements, and other acts beyond the control of the permit holder, as a basis for extending the completion date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as modified by this section and Sec. 50.55a, the construction permit shall be subject to the same conditions to which a license is subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> At or about the time of completion of the construction or modification of the facility, the applicant will file any additional information needed to bring the original application for license up to date, and will file an application for an operating license or an amendment to an application for a license to construct and operate the facility for the issuance of an operating license, as appropriate, as specified in Sec. 50.30(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> Definitions.
