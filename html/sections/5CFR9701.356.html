                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the requirements of this section, DHS will, after coordination with OPM, issue implementing directives regarding the application of pay retention. Pay retention prevents a reduction in basic pay that would otherwise occur by preserving the former rate of basic pay within the employee's new band or by establishing a retained rate that exceeds the maximum rate of the new band.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pay retention must be based on the employee's rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action that would otherwise reduce the employee's rate. A retained rate must be compared to the range of rates of basic pay applicable to the employee's position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In applying Sec. 9701.323 (regarding pay increases provided at the time of a rate range adjustment under Sec. 9701.322), any increase in the rate of basic pay for an employee receiving a retained rate is equal to one-half of the percentage value of any increase in the minimum rate of the employee's band.</p>
