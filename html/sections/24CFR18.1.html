                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Housing and Urban Development may indemnify, in whole or in part, a Department employee (which for the purpose of this part includes a former Department employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any such employee, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken

within the scope of his or her employment with the Department; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such indemnification is in the interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department of Housing and Urban Development may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against a Department employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an employee of the Department becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly notify the head of his or her operating component and the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement, if the supervisor is located at headquarters, or Field Assistant General Counsel--who shall promptly notify the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement--if the supervisor is located in the field. As used in this section, the term ``principal operating component'' means an office in the Department headed by an Assistant Secretary, the General Counsel, the Inspector General, or an equivalent departmental officer who reports directly to the Secretary. Questions regarding representation of the employee will be determined by the Department of Justice pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15 (Representation of Federal officials and employees by Department of Justice attorneys or by private counsel furnished by the Department in civil, criminal, and congressional proceedings in which Federal employees are sued, subpoenaed, or charged in their individual capacities).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The employee may, thereafter, request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or monetary award entered against the employee or to compromise a claim pending against the employee. The employee shall submit a written request, with appropriate documentation including a copy of the verdict, judgment, award or other order or settlement proposal, in a timely manner to the head of the employee's principal operating component. The head of the employee's principal operating component shall submit the written request and accompanying documentation, together with a recommended disposition of the request, in a timely manner to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The General Counsel shall seek the views of the Department of Justice on the request. Where the Department of Justice has rendered a decision denying representation of the employee pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15, the General Counsel shall seek the concurrence of the Department of Justice on the request. If the Department of Justice does not concur in the request, the General Counsel shall so advise the employee and no further action on the employee's request shall be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In all instances except those where the Department of Justice has non-concurred in the request, the General Counsel shall forward for decision to the Secretary or his or her designee the employee's request, the recommendation of the head of the employee's principal operating component, the views of the Department of Justice, and the General Counsel's recommendation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any payment under this part, either to indemnify a Department employee or to settle a personal damage claim, is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Department that are permitted by law to be utilized for this purpose.</p>
