                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Our policy is to answer all requests, both oral and written, for records. However, in order to have the rights given you by the FOIA and by this regulation (for example, the right to appeal if we deny your request and the right to have our decisions reviewed in court), you must either make your request in writing or make it orally to a Freedom of Information Officer. Freedom of Information Officers and their staffs may put in writing any oral requests they receive directly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Addressing requests. It will help us to handle your request sooner if you address it to the Freedom of Information Officer in the HHS unit that is most likely to have the records you want. (See Sec. 5.31 of this part for a list of Freedom of Information Officers.) If you cannot determine this, send the request to: HHS Freedom of Information Officer, 645-F, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201. Write the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' on the envelope and letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Details in the letter. You should provide details that will help us identify and find the records you are requesting. If there is insufficient information, we will ask you for more. Include your telephone number(s) to help us reach you if we have questions. If you are not sure how to write your request or what details to include, communicate with a Freedom of Information Officer.</p>
