                            <p class="depth0">The Director may, upon receipt of an application and in accordance  with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing  the taking and importation of marine mammals for scientific research  purposes or for public display.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this subchapter plus the following additional information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the purpose, date, location and manner of the  taking or importation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the marine mammal or the marine mammal products  to be taken or imported, including the species or subspecies involved;  the population stock, when known, the number of specimens or products  (or the weight thereof, where appropriate); and the anticipated age,  size, sex, and condition (i.e., whether pregnant or nursing) of the  animals involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the marine mammal is to be taken and transported alive, a  complete description of the manner of transportation, care and  maintenance, including the type, size, and construction of the container  or artificial environment; arrangements for feeding and sanitation; a  statement of the applicant's qualifications and previous experience in  caring for and handling captive marine mammals and a like statement as  to the qualifications of any common carrier or agent to be employed to  transport the animal; and a written certification of a licensed  veterinarian knowledgeable in the field of marine mammals that he has  personally reviewed the arrangements for transporting and maintaining  the animals and that in his opinion they are adequate to provide for the  well-being of the animal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the application is for a scientific research permit, a  detailed description of the scientific research project or program in  which the marine mammal or marine mammal product is to be used including  a copy of the research proposal relating to such program or project and  the names and addresses of the sponsor or cooperating institution and  the scientists involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the application is for a scientific research permit, and if  the marine mammal proposed to be taken or imported is listed as an  endangered or threatened species or has been designated by the Secretary  as depleted, a detailed justification of the need for such a marine  mammal, including a discussion of possible alternatives, whether or not  under the control of the applicant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the application is for a public display permit, a detailed  description of the proposed use to which the marine mammal or marine  mammal product is to be put, including the manner, location, and times  of display, whether such display is for profit, an estimate of the  numbers and types of persons who it is anticipated will benefit for such  display, and whether and to what extent the display is connected with  educational or scientific programs. There shall also be included a  complete description of the enterprise seeking the display permit and  its educational, and scientific qualifications, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review by Marine Mammal Commission. Upon receipt of an  application the Director shall forward the application to the Marine  Mammal Commission together with a request for the recommendations of the  Commission and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals.  In order to comply with the time limits provided in these regulations,  the Director shall request that such recommendation be submitted within  30 days of receipt of the application by the Commission. If the  Commission or the Committee, as the case may be, does not respond within  30 days from the receipt of such application by the Commission, the  Director shall advise the Commission in writing that failure to respond  within 45 days from original receipt of the application (or such longer  time as the Director may establish) shall be considered as a  recommendation from the Commission and the Committee that the permit be  issued.

Permits applied for under this section shall  be issued, suspended, modified and revoked pursuant to regulations  contained in Sec.  18.33.

In  determining whether to issue a public display permit, the Director shall  consider whether the proposed taking or importation will be consistent  with the policies and purposes of the Act; whether a substantial public  benefit will be gained from the display contemplated, taking into  account the manner of the display and the anticipated audience on the  one hand, and the effect of the proposed taking or importation on the  population stocks of the marine mammal in question and the marine  ecosystem on the other; and the applicant's qualifications for the  proper care and maintenance of the marine mammal or the marine mammal  product, and the adequacy of his facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional permit conditions.
