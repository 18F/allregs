                                Sec. 10.16  Assembly abroad.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assembly operations. The assembly operations performed abroad  may consist of any method used to join or fit together solid components,  such as welding, soldering, riveting, force fitting, gluing, laminating,  sewing, or the use of fasteners, and may be preceded, accompanied, or  followed by operations incidental to the assembly as illustrated in  paragraph (b) of this section. The mixing or combining of liquids,  gases, chemicals, food ingredients, and amorphous solids with each other  or with solid components is not regarded as an assembly.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A television yoke is assembled abroad from American-made  magnet wire. In the foreign assembly plant the wire is despooled and  wound into a coil, the wire cut from the spool, and the coil united with  other components, including a terminal panel and housing which are also  American-made. The completed article upon importation would be subject  to the ad valorem rate of duty applicable to television parts upon the  value of the yoke less the cost or value of the American-made wire,  terminal panel and housing, assembled therein. The winding and cutting  of the wire are either assembly steps or steps incidental to assembly.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is assembled abroad  from American-made aluminum foil, paper, tape, and Mylar film. In the  foreign assembly plant the aluminum foil is trimmed to the desired  width, cut to the desired length, interleaved with paper, which may or  may not be cut to length or despooled from a continuous length, and  rolled into a cylinder wherein the foil and paper are cut and a section  of sealing tape fastened to the surface to prevent these components from  unwinding. Wire or other electric connectors are bonded at appropriate  intervals to the aluminum foil of the cylinder which is then inserted  into a metal can, and the ends closed with a protective washer. As  imported, the capacitor is subject to the ad valorem rate of duty  applicable to capacitors upon the value less the cost or value of the  American-made foil, paper, tape, and Mylar film. The operations  performed on these components are all either assembly steps or steps  incidental to assembly.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The manufacture abroad of cloth on a loom using thread or  yarn exported from the United States on spools, cops, or pirns is not  considered an assembly but a weaving operation, and the thread or yarn  does not qualify for the exemption. However, American-made thread used  to sew buttons or garment components is qualified for the exemption  because it is used in an operation involving the assembly of solid  components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operations incidental to the assembly process. Operations  incidental to the assembly process whether performed before, during, or  after assembly, do not constitute further fabrication, and will not  preclude the application of the exemption. The following are examples of  operations which are incidental to the assembly process:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleaning;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Removal of rust, grease, paint, or other preservative coating;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application of paint or preservative coating, including  preservative metallic coating, lubricants, or protective encapsulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Trimming, filing, or cutting off of small amounts of excess  materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adjustments in the shape or form of a component to the extent  required by the assembly being performed abroad;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cutting to length of wire, thread, tape, foil, and similar  products exported in continuous length; separation by cutting of  finished components, such as prestamped integrated circuit lead frames  exported in multiple unit strips; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Final calibration, testing, marking, sorting, pressing, and  folding of assembled articles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operations not incidental to the assembly process. Any  significant process, operation, or treatment other than assembly whose  primary purpose is the fabrication, completion, physical or chemical  improvement of a component, or which is not related to the assembly  process, whether or not it effects a substantial transformation of the  article, will not be regarded as incidental to the assembly and will  preclude the application of the exemption to such article. The following  are examples of operations not considered incidental to the assembly as  provided under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff   Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Melting of exported ingots and pouring of the metal into molds  to produce cast metal parts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cutting of garment parts according to pattern from exported  material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chemical treatment of components or assembled articles to impart  new characteristics, such as showerproofing, permapressing, sanforizing,  dying or bleaching of textiles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Machining, polishing, burnishing, peening, plating (other than  plating incidental to the assembly), embossing, pressing, stamping,  extruding, drawing, annealing, tempering, case hardening, and any other  operation, treatment or process which imparts significant new  characteristics or qualities to the article affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joining of American-made and foreign-made components. An  assembly operation may involve the use of American-made components and  foreign-made components. The various requirements for establishing  entitlement to the exemption apply only to the American-made components  of the assembly.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Diodes are assembled abroad from American-made components.  The process includes the encapsulation of the assembled components in a  plastic shell. The plastic used for the encapsulation is in the form of  a pellet, and is of foreign origin. After the prefabricated diode  components are assembled, the assembled unit is placed in a transfer  molding machine, where, by use of the pellet, molten epoxy is caused to  flow around the perimeters of the assembled components, forming upon  solidification a plastic body for the diode. Upon importation, exemption  may be granted for the value of the American-made components, but not  for the value of the plastic pellet. If the plastic pellet used for  encapsulation was of United States origin, its value would still be a  part of the dutiable value of the diode, because the plastic pellet is  not a fabricated component of a type designed to be fitted together by  assembly, but merely a premeasured quantity of material which was  applied to the assembled unit by a process not constituting an assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subassembly. An assembly operation may involve the joining or  fitting of American-made components into a part or subassembly of an  article, followed by the installation of the part or subassembly into  the complete article.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Rolls of foil and rolls of paper are exported and cut to  specific length abroad and interleaved and rolled to form the electrodes  and dielectric of a capacitor. Following this procedure, the rolls are  assembled with cans and other parts to form a complete capacitor. The  foil and paper are entitled to the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Packing. The packing abroad of merchandise into containers does  not in itself qualify either the containers or their contents for the  exemption. However, assembled articles which otherwise qualify for the  exemption and which are packaged abroad following their assembly will  not be disqualified from the exemption by reason of their having been so  packaged, whether for retail sale or for bulk shipment. The tariff  status of the packing materials or containers will be determined in  accordance with General Rule of Interpretation 5, HTSUS (19 U.S.C.  1202).  [T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43023, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53  FR 51248, Dec. 21, 1988; CBP Dec. 08-21, 73 FR 33300, June 12, 2008]</p>
