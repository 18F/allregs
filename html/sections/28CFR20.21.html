                                Sec.  20.21  Preparation and submission of a Criminal History Record
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A plan shall be submitted to OJARS by each State on March 16, 1976,  to set forth all operational procedures, except those portions relating  to dissemination and security. A supplemental plan covering these  portions shall be submitted no later than 90 days after promulgation of  these amended regulations. The plan shall set forth operational  procedures to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Completeness and accuracy. Insure that criminal history record  information is complete and accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Complete records should be maintained at a central State  repository. To be complete, a record maintained at a central State  repository which contains information that an individual has been  arrested, and which is available for dissemination, must contain  information of any dispositions occurring within the State within 90  days after the disposition has occurred. The above shall apply to all  arrests occurring subsequent to the effective date of these regulations.  Procedures shall be established for criminal justice agencies to query  the central repository prior to dissemination of any criminal history  record information unless it can be assured that the most up-to-date  disposition data is being used. Inquiries of a central State repository  shall be made prior to any dissemination except in those cases where  time is of the essence and the repository is technically incapable of  responding within the necessary time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To be accurate means that no record containing criminal history  record information shall contain erroneous information. To accomplish  this end, criminal justice agencies shall institute a process of data  collection, entry, storage, and systematic audit that will minimize the  possibility of   recording and storing inaccurate information and upon finding inaccurate  information of a material nature, shall notify all criminal justice  agencies known to have received such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on dissemination. Insure that dissemination of  nonconviction data has been limited, whether directly or through any  intermediary only to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Criminal justice agencies, for purposes of the administration of  criminal justice and criminal justice agency employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individuals and agencies for any purpose authorized by statute,  ordinance, executive order, or court rule, decision, or order, as  construed by appropriate State or local officials or agencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individuals and agencies pursuant to a specific agreement with a  criminal justice agency to provide services required for the  administration of criminal justice pursuant to that agreement. The  agreement shall specifically authorize access to data, limit the use of  data to purposes for which given, insure the security and  confidentiality of the data consistent with these regulations, and  provide sanctions for violation thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individuals and agencies for the express purpose of research,  evaluative, or statistical activities pursuant to an agreement with a  criminal justice agency. The agreement shall specifically authorize  access to data, limit the use of data to research, evaluative, or  statistical purposes, insure the confidentiality and security of the  data consistent with these regulations and with section 524(a) of the  Act and any regulations implementing section 524(a), and provide  sanctions for the violation thereof. These dissemination limitations do  not apply to conviction data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General policies on use and dissemination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of criminal  history record information disseminated to noncriminal justice agencies  shall be limited to the purpose for which it was given.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No agency or individual shall confirm the existence or  nonexistence of criminal history record information to any person or  agency that would not be eligible to receive the information itself.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (b) does not mandate dissemination of criminal  history record information to any agency or individual. States and local  governments will determine the purposes for which dissemination of  criminal history record information is authorized by State law,  executive order, local ordinance, court rule, decision or order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Juvenile records. Insure that dissemination of records  concerning proceedings relating to the adjudication of a juvenile as  delinquent or in need or supervision (or the equivalent) to noncriminal  justice agencies is prohibited, unless a statute, court order, rule or  court decision specifically authorizes dissemination of juvenile  records, except to the same extent as criminal history records may be  disseminated as provided in paragraph (b) (3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Audit. Insure that annual audits of a representative sample of  State and local criminal justice agencies chosen on a random basis shall  be conducted by the State to verify adherence to these regulations and  that appropriate records shall be retained to facilitate such audits.  Such records shall include, but are not limited to, the names of all  persons or agencies to whom information is disseminated and the date  upon which such information is disseminated. The reporting of a criminal  justice transaction to a State, local or Federal repository is not a  dissemination of information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Security. Wherever criminal history record information is  collected, stored, or disseminated, each State shall insure that the  following requirements are satisfied by security standards established  by State legislation, or in the absence of such legislation, by  regulations approved or issued by the Governor of the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where computerized data processing is employed, effective and  technologically advanced software and hardware designs are instituted to  prevent unauthorized access to such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Access to criminal history record information system facilities,  systems operating environments, data file contents whether while in use  or when   stored in a media library, and system documentation is restricted to  authorized organizations and personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Computer operations, whether dedicated or shared, which  support criminal justice information systems, operate in accordance with  procedures developed or approved by the participating criminal justice  agencies that assure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criminal history record information is stored by the computer in  such manner that it cannot be modified, destroyed, accessed, changed,  purged, or overlaid in any fashion by non-criminal justice terminals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operation programs are used that will prohibit inquiry, record  updates, or destruction of records, from any terminal other than  criminal justice system terminals which are so designated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The destruction of records is limited to designated terminals  under the direct control of the criminal justice agency responsible for  creating or storing the criminal history record information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Operational programs are used to detect and store for the output  of designated criminal justice agency employees all unauthorized  attempts to penetrate any criminal history record information system,  program or file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The programs specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) (b) and (d) of  this section are known only to criminal justice agency employees  responsible for criminal history record information system control or  individuals and agencies pursuant to a specific agreement with the  criminal justice agency to provide such programs and the program(s) are  kept continuously under maximum security conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedures are instituted to assure that an individual or agency  authorized direct access is responsible for (1) the physical security of  criminal history record information under its control or in its custody  and (2) the protection of such information from unauthorized access,  disclosure or dissemination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Procedures are instituted to protect any central repository of  criminal history record information from unauthorized access, theft,  sabotage, fire, flood, wind, or other natural or manmade disasters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A criminal justice agency shall have the right to audit,  monitor and inspect procedures established above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The criminal justice agency will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Screen and have the right to reject for employment, based on  good cause, all personnel to be authorized to have direct access to  criminal history record information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Have the right to initiate or cause to be initiated  administrative action leading to the transfer or removal of personnel  authorized to have direct access to such information where such  personnel violate the provisions of these regulations or other security  requirements established for the collection, storage, or dissemination  of criminal history record information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Institute procedures, where computer processing is not  utilized, to assure that an individual or agency authorized direct  access is responsible for</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The physical security of criminal history record information  under its control or in its custody and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The protection of such information from unauthorized access,  disclosure, or dissemination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Institute procedures, where computer processing is not  utilized, to protect any central repository of criminal history record  information from unauthorized access, theft, sabotage, fire, flood,  wind, or other natural or manmade disasters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide that direct access to criminal history record  information shall be available only to authorized officers or employees  of a criminal justice agency and, as necessary, other authorized  personnel essential to the proper operation of the criminal history  record information system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each employee working with or having access to criminal history  record information shall be made familiar with the substance and intent  of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Access and review. Insure the individual's right to access and  review of criminal history information for purposes of accuracy and  completeness by instituting procedures so that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any individual shall, upon satisfactory verification of his  identity, be   entitled to review without undue burden to either the criminal justice  agency or the individual, any criminal history record information  maintained about the individual and obtain a copy thereof when necessary  for the purpose of challenge or correction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Administrative review and necessary correction of any claim by  the individual to whom the information relates that the information is  inaccurate or incomplete is provided;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State shall establish and implement procedures for  administrative appeal where a criminal justice agency refuses to correct  challenged information to the satisfaction of the individual to whom the  information relates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Upon request, an individual whose record has been corrected  shall be given the names of all non-criminal justice agencies to whom  the data has been given;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The correcting agency shall notify all criminal justice  recipients of corrected information; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The individual's right to access and review of criminal history  record information shall not extend to data contained in intelligence,  investigatory, or other related files and shall not be construed to  include any other information than that defined by Sec.  20.3(b).
