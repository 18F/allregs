                            <p class="depth0">The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for  a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under  Sec. 96.183 is submitted in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and  the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency  of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR  opt-in permit under Sec. 96.183. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for  purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information  demonstrating that the NOX emissions rate and heat input of  the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported  in accordance with subpart HH of this part. A determination of  sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the  monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring and reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the permitting authority and  the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under  paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and  report the NOX emissions rate and the heat input of the unit  and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HH of  this part, starting on the date of certification of the appropriate  monitoring systems under subpart HH of this part and continuing until a  CAIR opt-in permit is denied under Sec. 96.184(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in  permit is issued, the date and time when the unit is withdrawn from the  CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program in accordance with Sec.  96.186.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section shall include the entire control period immediately before the  date on which the unit enters the CAIR NOX Annual Trading  Program under Sec. 96.184(g), during which period monitoring system   availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HH of this  part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State  or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent the NOX emissions rate and the heat  input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart  HH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the  control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which  control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90  percent under subpart HH of this part and the unit is in full compliance  with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related  requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 years  before the unit enters the CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program  under Sec. 96.184(g), such information shall be used as provided in  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu)  for the control period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Baseline NOX emission rate. The unit's baseline  NOX emission rate shall equal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the unit's NOX emissions  rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the unit's NOX emissions rate and heat input are  monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance  with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on  NOX emission controls during any such control periods, the  average of the amounts of the unit's NOX emissions rate (in  lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on  NOX emission controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline  heat input and the baseline NOX emissions rate for the unit  under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting  authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that  the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NOX opt-in unit in  Sec. 96.180 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 96.183(a)(2), the  permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting  authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the  Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the  source that includes the CAIR NOX opt-in unit unless the  source already has a compliance account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before  issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority  determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that  the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NOX opt-in unit in  Sec. 96.180 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 96.183(a)(2), the  permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Date of entry into CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program. A  unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting  authority shall become a CAIR NOX opt-in unit, and a CAIR  NOX unit, as of the later of January 1, 2009 or January 1 of  the first control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Repowered CAIR NOX opt-in unit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If CAIR  designated representative   requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit  providing for, allocation to a CAIR NOX opt-in unit of CAIR  NOX allowances under Sec. 96.188(c) and such unit is  repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR NOX Annual  Trading Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit  shall be treated as a CAIR NOX opt-in unit replacing the  original CAIR NOX opt-in unit, as of the date of start-up of  the repowered unit's combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of  the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the  repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of  operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat  input, and baseline NOX emission rate as the original CAIR  NOX opt-in unit, and the original CAIR NOX opt-in  unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR NOX opt-in unit or  a CAIR NOX unit.
