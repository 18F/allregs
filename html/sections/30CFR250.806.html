BSEE recognizes two quality assurance programs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ANSI/ASME SPPE-1-1994 and SPPE-1d-1996 Addenda, Quality Assurance and Certification of Safety and Pollution Prevention Equipment Used in Offshore Oil and Gas Operations (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> API Spec Q1, Specification for Quality Programs for the Petroleum, Petrochemical and Natural Gas Industry (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All SSV's and USV's must meet the technical specifications of API Spec 6A and 6AV1. All SSSVs must meet the technical specifications of API Specification 14A (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). However, SSSVs and related equipment planned to be used in high pressure high temperature environments must meet the additional requirements set forth in Sec.  250.807.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For information on all standards mentioned in this section, see Sec.  250.198.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of noncertified SPPE.

The BSEE will consider recognizing other quality assurance programs covering the manufacture of SPPE. If you want BSEE to evaluate other quality assurance programs, submit relevant information about the program and reasons for recognition by BSEE to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; MS-4020; 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 20170-4817.</p>
