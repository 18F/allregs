                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Application for original approval of an aircraft dispatcher certification course or the renewal of approval of an aircraft dispatcher certification course under this part must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Made in writing to the Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accompanied by two copies of the course outline required under Sec. 65.61(b) of this part, for which approval is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accompanied by a description of the equipment and facilities to be used; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Accompanied by a list of the instructors and their qualifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration. Unless withdrawn or canceled, an approval of an aircraft dispatcher certification course of study expires:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the last day of the 24th month from the month the approval was issued; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, on the date that any change in ownership of the school occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Renewal. Application for renewal of an approved aircraft dispatcher certification course must be made within 30 days preceding the month the approval expires, provided the course operator meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 80 percent of the graduates from that aircraft dispatcher certification course, who applied for the practical test required by Sec. 65.59 of this part, passed the practical test on their first attempt; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aircraft dispatcher certification course continues to meet the requirements of this subpart for course approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Course revisions.
