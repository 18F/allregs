The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation N owns all of the one class of stock  of controlled foreign corporation A. Corporation A, after paying foreign  income taxes of $30, has earnings and profits for 1978 of $70, all of  which are attributable to an amount required under section 951(a) to be  included in N Corporation's gross income for 1978. Both corporations use  the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1979 and 1980, A Corporation  has no earnings and profits attributable to an amount required to be  included in N Corporation's gross income under section 951(a); for each  such year it makes a distribution of $35 (from its earnings and profits  for 1978) from which a foreign income tax of $6 is withheld. For each of  1978, 1979, and 1980, N Corporation derives taxable income of $50 from  sources within the United States and claims a foreign tax credit under  section 901, determined by applying the overall limitation under section  904(a)(2).  The United States tax payable by N Corporation is determined as follows,  assuming a corporate tax rate of 48 percent:</p><p class="depth0">1978 Taxable income of N Corporation:</p><p class="depth0">U.S. sources...............................................     $50.00</p><p class="depth0">Sources without the U.S.:</p><p class="depth0">Amount required to be included in N                $70.00</p><p class="depth0">Corporation's gross income under section</p><p class="depth0">951(a).......................................</p><p class="depth0">Foreign income taxes deemed paid by N               30.00     100.00</p><p class="depth0">Corporation under section 960(a)(1) and</p><p class="depth0">included in N Corporation's gross income</p><p class="depth0">under section 78 ($30x$70/$70)...............</p><p class="depth0">---------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total taxable income..........................  .........     150.00</p><p class="depth0">========== U.S. tax payable for 1978:</p><p class="depth0">U.S. tax before credit ($150x0.48).........................      72.00</p><p class="depth0">Credit: Foreign income taxes of $30, but not to exceed           30.00</p><p class="depth0">overall limitation of $48 for 1978 ($100/$150x$72)........</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">U.S. tax payable...........................................      42.00</p><p class="depth0">============</p><p class="depth0">1979 Taxable income of N Corporation, consisting of income from        $50.00</p><p class="depth0">U.S. sources................................................

The facts for 1978, 1979, and 1980, are the same as in  example 1, except that in 1977, to which the section 904(a)(2) overall  limitation applies, N Corporation pays $18 of foreign income taxes in  excess of the overall limitation and that such excess is not absorbed as  a carryback to 1975 or 1976 under section 904(c). Therefore, there is no  increase under section 960(b)(1) in the overall limitation for 1979 or  1980 since the amount ($48) by which the 1978 overall limitation was  increased by reason of the inclusion in N Corporation's gross income for  1978 under section 951(a), less the foreign income taxes ($48) allowed  as a credit which were allowable solely by reason of such inclusion, is  zero. The foreign income taxes so allowed as a credit for 1978 which  were allowable solely by reason of such section 951(a) inclusion consist  of the $30 of foreign income taxes deemed paid for 1978 under section  960(a)(1) and the $18 of foreign income taxes for 1977 carried over and  deemed paid for 1978 under section 904(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  to be included in N Corporation's gross income for 1978, and $35 of  which it distributes in such year to A Corporation. For 1978, A  Corporation, after paying foreign income taxes of $5 on such dividend  from B Corporation, has total earnings and profits of $30, all of which  it distributes in such year to N Corporation, a foreign income tax of $3  being withheld therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For 1979, B Corporation has no earnings and profits, but  distributes in such year to A Corporation the $35 remaining of its  earnings and profits for 1965. For 1979, A Corporation, after paying  foreign income taxes of $5 on such dividend from B Corporation, has  total earnings and profits of $30, all of which it distributes to N  Corporation, a foreign income tax of $3 being withheld therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each of 1978 and 1979, N Corporation has taxable income of  $100 from United States sources and claims a foreign tax credit under  section 901, determined by applying the overall limitation under section  904(a)(2).
