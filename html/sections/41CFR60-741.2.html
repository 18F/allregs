The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining other examples of major life activities, the term ``major'' shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability.

The term mitigating measures includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The term reasonable accommodation means modifications or adjustments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term reasonable accommodation means modifications or adjustments:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such applicant desires; \1\ or---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ A contractor's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation with respect to applicants with disabilities is not limited to those who ultimately demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the job in issue. Applicants with disabilities must be provided a reasonable accommodation with respect to the application process if they are qualified with respect to that process (e.g., if they present themselves at the correct location and time to fill out an application).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That enable the contractor's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by the contractor's other similarly situated employees without disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable accommodation may include but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustments or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the contractor to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.\2\ This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. (Appendix A of this part provides guidance on a contractor's duty to provide reasonable accommodation.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ Before providing a reasonable accommodation, the contractor is strongly encouraged to verify with the individual with a disability that the accommodation will effectively meet the individual's needs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Individuals who meet the definition of ``disability'' solely under the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of ``disability'' as defined in paragraph (v)(1) of this section are not entitled to receive reasonable accommodation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Record of such impairment means has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. An individual shall be considered to have a record of a disability if the individual has a history of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities when compared to most people in the general population, or was misclassified as having had such an impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Recruiting and training agency means any person who refers workers to any contractor, or who provides or supervises apprenticeship or training for employment by any contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Regarded as having such an impairment--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (v)(4) of this section, an individual is regarded as having such an impairment if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited under subpart B (Discrimination Prohibited) of these regulations because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not the impairment substantially limits or is perceived to substantially limit a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (v)(4) of this section, an individual is regarded as having such an impairment if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited under subpart B (Discrimination Prohibited) of these regulations because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not the impairment substantially limits or is perceived to substantially limit a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (v)(4) of this section, an individual is regarded as having such an impairment any time a contractor takes a prohibited action against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the contractor asserts, or may or does ultimately establish a defense to such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishing that an individual is regarded as having such an impairment does not, by itself, establish liability for unlawful discrimination in violation of this part. Such liability is established only when an individual proves that a contractor discriminated on the basis of disability as prohibited by this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Impairments that are transitory and minor. Paragraph (v)(1) of this section shall not apply to an impairment that is shown by the contractor to be transitory and minor. The contractor must demonstrate that the impairment is both ``transitory'' and ``minor.'' Whether the impairment at issue is or would be ``transitory and ``minor'' is to be determined objectively. The fact that a contractor subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor is not sufficient to defeat an individual's coverage under paragraph (v)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An impairment is transitory if it has an actual or expected duration of six months or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Secretary means the Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor, or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Subcontract means any agreement or arrangement between a contractor and any person (in which the parties do not stand in the relationship of an employer and an employee):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services (including construction) which, in whole or in part, is necessary to the performance of any one or more contracts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under which any portion of the contractor's obligation under any one or more contracts is performed, undertaken, or assumed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Subcontractor means any person holding a subcontract in excess of $10,000 and, for the purposes of subpart D of this part, ``General Enforcement and Complaint Procedures,'' any person who has held a subcontract subject to the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Substantially limits--(1) In general. The term ``substantially limits'' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Substantially limits is not meant to be a demanding standard and should not demand extensive analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``substantially limits'' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Substantially limits is not meant to be a demanding standard and should not demand extensive analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An impairment is substantially limiting within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered ``substantially limiting.'' Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis. However, nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the presentation of scientific, medical, or statistical evidence to make such a comparison where appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it may be useful in appropriate cases to consider, as compared to most people in the general population, the condition under which the individual performs the major life activity; the manner in which the individual performs the major life activity; and/or the duration of time it takes the individual to perform the major life activity, or for which the individual can perform the major life activity. This may include consideration of facts such as the difficulty, effort, or time required to perform a major life activity; pain experienced when performing a major life activity; the length of time a major life activity can be performed; and/or the way an impairment affects the operation of a major bodily function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-applicability to the ``regarded as'' prong. Whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity is not relevant to a determination of whether the individual is regarded as having a disability within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. Except as provided in paragraph (z)(3)(i) of this section, the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures as defined in paragraph (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ameliorative effects of the mitigating measures of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. See paragraph (n)(2) of this section for a definition of ``ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. The non-ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, such as negative side effects of medication or burdens associated with following a particular treatment regimen, may be considered when determining whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In determining whether an individual is substantially limited the focus is on how a major life activity is substantially limited, and not on the outcomes an individual can achieve. For example, someone with a learning disability may achieve a high level of academic success, but may nevertheless be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning because of the additional time or effort he or she must spend to read, write, or learn compared to most people in the general population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Predictable assessments. The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment. However, the principles set forth in this section are intended to provide for generous coverage through a framework that is predictable, consistent, and workable for all individuals and contractors with rights and responsibilities under this part. Therefore, the individualized assessment of some types of impairments will, in virtually all cases, result in a determination of coverage under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. Given their inherent nature, these types of impairments will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity. With respect to these types of impairments, the necessary individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Examples of predictable assessments. Applying the principles set forth in this section it should easily be concluded that the following types of impairments will, at a minimum, substantially limit the major life activities indicated: deafness substantially limits hearing; blindness substantially limits seeing; an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation) substantially limits brain function; partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair substantially limit musculoskeletal function; autism substantially limits brain function; cancer substantially limits normal cell growth; cerebral palsy substantially limits brain function; diabetes substantially limits endocrine function; epilepsy substantially limits neurological function; Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection substantially limits immune function; multiple sclerosis (MS) substantially limits neurological function; muscular dystrophy substantially limits neurological function; and major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia substantially limit brain function. The types of impairments described in this section may also substantially limit additional major life activities not explicitly listed above.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Undue hardship--(1) In general. Undue hardship means, with respect to the provision of an accommodation, significant difficulty or expense incurred by the contractor, when considered in light of the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Undue hardship means, with respect to the provision of an accommodation, significant difficulty or expense incurred by the contractor, when considered in light of the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors to be considered. In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the contractor, factors to be considered include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits and deductions, and/or outside funding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The overall financial resources of the contractor, the overall size of the business of the contractor with respect to the number of its employees, and the number, type and location of its facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The type of operation or operations of the contractor, including the composition, structure and functions of the work force of such contractor, and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the contractor; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility, including the impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(bb)</em> United States, as used herein, shall include the several States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island.</p>
