                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Normal process for adding, revising, or removing treatment  schedules. Unless there is a need to immediately add, revise, or remove  a treatment schedule, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a  treatment schedule may be added to the PPQ Treatment Manual,   revised, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of change to treatment schedule. APHIS will publish in  the Federal Register a notice describing the reasons we have determined  that it is necessary to add, revise, or remove a treatment schedule and,  if necessary, making available the new or revised treatment schedule as  it would be added to the PPQ Treatment Manual. In our notice, we will  provide for a public comment period on the new or revised treatment  schedule or on the removal of the treatment schedule from the PPQ  Treatment Manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Response to comments. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> APHIS will issue a notice after the  close of the public comment period indicating that the treatment  schedule specified in the initial notice will be added to the PPQ  Treatment Manual, revised as described in the notice, or removed from  the PPQ Treatment Manual if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No comments were received on the notice;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The comments on the notice supported our action; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The comments on the notice were evaluated but did not change our  determination that it is necessary to add, revise, or remove the  treatment schedule, as described in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the notice issued after the close of the public comment  period indicates that a change will be made to the PPQ Treatment Manual,  APHIS will make available a new version of the PPQ Treatment Manual that  reflects the addition, revision, or removal of the particular treatment  schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If comments present information that causes us to determine  that the change described in the notice is not appropriate, APHIS will  issue a notice informing the public of this determination after the  close of the comment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circumstances in which the immediate process may be used.  Treatment schedules may be immediately added to the PPQ Treatment  Manual, revised, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual if any of the  following circumstances apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> PPQ has determined that an approved treatment schedule is  ineffective at neutralizing the targeted plant pest(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> PPQ has determined that, in order to neutralize the targeted  plant pest(s), the treatment schedule must be administered using a  different process than was previously used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> PPQ has determined that a new treatment schedule is effective,  based on efficacy data, and that ongoing trade in an article or articles  may be adversely impacted unless the new treatment schedule is approved  for use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The use of a treatment schedule is no longer authorized by the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or by any other Federal entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Process for immediate change to treatment schedules. If PPQ  determines that one or more of the circumstances in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section applies and that it is necessary to take immediate action,  APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice describing the  reasons we have determined that it is necessary to immediately add,  revise, or remove a treatment schedule and, if necessary, making  available the new or revised treatment schedule as it has been added to  the PPQ Treatment Manual. Treatment schedules that have been added to  the PPQ Treatment Manual or revised under this process will be  identified in the PPQ Treatment Manual as having been added or revised  through the immediate process described in this paragraph (b). The PPQ  Treatment Manual will indicate that these treatment schedules are  subject to change or removal based on public comment. In our notice, we  will provide for a public comment period on the new or revised treatment  schedule or on the removal of the treatment schedule from the PPQ  Treatment Manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Response to comments. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> APHIS will issue a notice after the  close of the   public comment period affirming the action described in the initial  notice if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No comments were received on the notice;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The comments on the notice supported our action; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The comments on the notice were evaluated but did not change our  determination that it was necessary to add, revise, or remove the  treatment schedule, as described in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the notice issued after the close of the public comment  period indicates that the initial change to the PPQ Treatment Manual is  affirmed, APHIS will make available a new version of the PPQ Treatment  Manual that will reflect the addition, revision, or removal of the  particular treatment schedule in the main body of the PPQ Treatment  Manual.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If comments present information that causes us to determine  that it is necessary to change a treatment schedule added to the PPQ  Treatment Manual under this process or to further revise a treatment  schedule that was revised under this process, APHIS will publish a  notice in the Federal Register informing the public of this  determination after the close of the comment period and will revise the  treatment schedule accordingly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If comments present information that causes us to determine  that the change described in the initial notice was not appropriate,  APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public  of this determination after the close of the comment period and will, if  necessary, remove the new or revised treatment schedule from the  separate section of the PPQ Treatment Manual.</p>
