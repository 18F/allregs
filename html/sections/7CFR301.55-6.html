If the  cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the  cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances  allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may  appeal the decision, in writing, to the Administrator, within 10 days  after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal  must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to  show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. As promptly  as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal,  in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held  to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice  concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
