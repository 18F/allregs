This covenant shall not apply, however, to  the lease or rental of a room or rooms within a family dwelling unit;  nor shall it apply with respect to religion to premises used primarily  for religious purposes. The United States of America shall be deemed a  beneficiary of this covenant without regard to whether it remains the  owner of any land or interest therein in the locality of the property  hereby conveyed and shall have the sole right to enforce this covenant  in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">Power Transmission Lines</p>
