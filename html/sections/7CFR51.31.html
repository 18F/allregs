                            <p class="depth0">After an appeal inspection has been completed, an appeal inspection certificate shall be issued showing the results of such appeal inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection certificate previously issued for the product involved. Each appeal inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and date of the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality described therein. The inspector or inspectors issuing an appeal inspection certificate shall sign the certificate and forward notice of such issuance to such persons as considered necessary to prevent misuse of the superseded certificate if the original and all copies of such superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the inspector or inspectors issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The provisions in the regulations in this part concerning forms of certificates and issuance of certificates, shall apply to appeal inspection certificates, except that copies of such appeal inspection certificates shall be furnished all interested parties who receive copies of the superseded certificate.</p><p class="depth0">Licensing of Inspectors</p>
