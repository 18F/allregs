Equal access expenses are limited to such expenditures for  converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers  or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal  access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions  by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary  accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access  investment.</p>
