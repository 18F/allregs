Equal access expenses are limited to such expenditures for converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access investment.</p>
