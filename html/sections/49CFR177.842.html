The  total transport index of a group of packages and overpacks is determined  by adding together the transport index number on the labels on the  individual packages and overpacks in the group. This provision does not  apply to exclusive use shipments described in Secs. 173.441(b), 173.457,  and 173.427 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Packages of Class 7 (radioactive) material bearing ``RADIOACTIVE   YELLOW-II'' or ``RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-III'' labels may not be placed in a  transport vehicle, storage location or in any other place closer than  the distances shown in the following table to any area which may be  continuously occupied by any passenger, employee, or animal, nor closer  than the distances shown in the table to any package containing  undeveloped film (if so marked), and must conform to the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If more than one of these packages is present, the distance must  be computed from the following table on the basis of the total transport  index number determined by adding together the transport index number on  the labels on the individual packages and overpacks in the vehicle or  storeroom.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where more than one group of packages is present in any single  storage location, a single group may not have a total transport index  greater than 50.

The sum of criticality safety indices (CSIs) for  packages containing fissile material may not exceed 100 in an exclusive  use vehicle.
