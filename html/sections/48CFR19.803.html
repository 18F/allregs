                            <p class="depth0">Through their cooperative efforts, the SBA and an agency match the  agency's requirements with the capabilities of 8(a) concerns to  establish a basis for the agency to contract with the SBA under the  program. Selection is initiated in one of three ways--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> firm's capabilities and asks the agency to identify  acquisitions to support the firm's business plans. In these instances,  the SBA will provide at least the following information in order to  enable the agency to match an acquisition to the firm's capabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the concern and its owners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Background information on the concern, including any and all  information pertaining to the concern's technical ability and capacity  to perform.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The firm's present production capacity and related facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which contracting assistance is needed in the  present and the future, described in terms that will enable the agency  to relate the concern's plans to present and future agency requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If construction is involved, the request shall also include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The concern's capabilities in and qualifications for  accomplishing various categories of maintenance, repair, alteration, and  construction work in specific categories such as mechanical, electrical,  heating and air conditioning, demolition, building, painting, paving,  earth work, waterfront work, and general construction work.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The concern's capacity in each construction category in terms  of estimated dollar value (e.g., electrical, up to $100,000).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The SBA identifies a specific requirement for a particular 8(a)  firm or firms and asks the agency contracting activity to offer the  acquisition to the 8(a) Program for the firm(s). In these instances, in  addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, the SBA  will provide--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A clear identification of the acquisition sought; e.g., project  name or number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement as to how any additional needed equipment and real  property will be provided in order to ensure that the firm will be fully  capable of satisfying the agency's requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If construction, information as to the bonding capability of the  firm(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If sole source request--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The reasons why the firm is considered suitable for this  particular acquisition; e.g., previous contracts for the same or similar  supply or service; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the firm is eligible in terms of NAICS code,  business support levels, and business activity targets; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If competitive, a statement that at least two 8(a) firms are  considered capable of satisfying the agency's requirements and a  statement that the firms are also eligible in terms of the NAICS code,  business support levels, and business activity targets. If requested by  the contracting activity, SBA will identify at least two such firms and  provide information concerning the firms' capabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the  purpose of identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA.  Where agencies independently, or through the self marketing efforts of  an 8(a) firm, identify a requirement for the 8(a) Program, they may  offer on behalf of a specific 8(a) firm, for the 8(a) Program in  general, or for 8(a) competition.
