the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material, and shall be based upon estimates of one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total cost necessary to put affected property back into use,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loss of use of affected property,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Value of affected property where not practical to restore to use,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial loss resulting from protective actions appropriate to reduce or avoid exposure to radiation or to radioactive materials.
