                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a farming operation includes any nonfamily members as specified under the provisions of Sec. 1400.201(b)(2) and (3) and the farming operation is seeking to qualify more than one person as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, then:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each such person must maintain contemporaneous records or logs as specified in Sec. 1400.603; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, if the farming operation seeks not more than one additional person to qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of

the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, because the operation is large, then the operation may qualify for one such additional person if the farming operation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Produces and markets crops on 2,500 acres or more of cropland;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Produces honey with more than 10,000 hives; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Produces wool with more than 3,500 ewes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the farming operation seeks not more than one additional person to qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, because the operation is complex, then the operation may qualify for one such additional person if the farming operation is determined by the FSA state committee as complex after considering the factors described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. Any determination that a farming operation is complex by an FSA state committee must be reviewed and DAFP must concur with such determination for it to be implemented. To demonstrate complexity, the farming operation will be required to provide information to the FSA state committee on the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Number and type of livestock, crops, or other agricultural products produced and marketing channels used; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Geographical area covered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FSA state committees may adjust the limitations described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section up or down by not more than 15 percent if the FSA state committee determines that the relative size of farming operations in the state justify making a modification of either or both of these limitations. If the FSA state committee seeks to make a larger adjustment, then DAFP will review and may approve such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a farming operation seeks to qualify a total of three persons as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, then the farming operation must demonstrate both size and complexity as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In no case may more than three persons in the same farming operation qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, as defined by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person's contribution of active personal management, or the contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, to a farming operation specified in Sec. 1400.601(b) will only qualify one member of that farming operation as actively engaged in farming as defined in this part. Other individual persons in the same farming operation are not precluded from making management contributions, except that such contributions will not be recognized as meeting the requirements of being a significant contribution of active personal management.</p>
