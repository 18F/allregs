As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Base labor index means the average of the labor indices for the three months which consist of the month of bid opening (or offer submission) and the months immediately preceding and following that month.</p><p class="depth0">Base steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 6) including all applicable extras of $-------- per ---------- (see note 1) for ---------- (see note 2) on the date set for bid opening (or the date of submission of the offer).</p><p class="depth0">Current labor index means the average of the labor indices for the month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made and the month preceding.</p><p class="depth0">Current steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 6) for that item, including all applicable extras in effect -------- days (see note 3) prior to the first day of the month in which delivery is required.</p><p class="depth0">Established price is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A price which is an established catalog or market price of a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The net price after applying any applicable standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule price. (But see Note 6.)</p><p class="depth0">Labor index means the average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's employees in the -------- shop of the Contractor's ---------- plant (see note 4) for any particular month.</p><p class="depth0">Month means calendar month. However, if the Contractor's accounting period does not coincide with the calendar month, then that accounting period shall be used in lieu of month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price of the steel item identified under the base steel index definition in paragraph (a) shall be ------ percent, and the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be ------ percent. (See note 5.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those employees in that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those employees in that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the cost of labor shall be computed solely by reference to the ``base labor index'' and the ``current labor index.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the cost of steel shall be computed solely by reference to the ``base steel index'' and the ``current steel index.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> Each contract unit price shall be revised for each month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each contract unit price shall be revised for each month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The revised contract unit price shall apply to the deliveries of those quantities required to be made in that month regardless of when actual delivery is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each revised contract unit price shall be computed by adding--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted cost of labor (obtained by multiplying ------ percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the current labor index and the denominator shall be the base labor index);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The adjusted cost of steel (obtained by multiplying ------ percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the current steel index and the denominator shall be the base steel index); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount equal to ------ percent of the original contract unit price (representing that portion of the unit price which relates neither to the cost of labor nor the cost of steel, and which is therefore not subject to revision (see note 5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Computations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 30 days after final delivery (or such other period as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer), the Contractor shall furnish a statement identifying the correctness of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) that are relevant to the computations of the base labor index and the current labor index; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor's established prices (see note 6), including all applicable extras for like quantities of the item that are relevant to the computation of the base steel index and the current steel index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Upon receipt of the statement, the Contracting Officer will compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised established price (see note 6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(1)</em> In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-terminated item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the Contractor of the notice of termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If the Contractor's failure to make delivery of any required quantity arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the clause of this contract entitled ``Default,'' the quantity not delivered shall be delivered as promptly as possible after the cessation of the cause of the failure, and the delivery schedule set forth in this contract shall be amended accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">Notes:</p><p class="depth0">1 Offeror insert the unit price and unit measure of the standard steel mill item to be used in the manufacture of the contract item.</p><p class="depth0">2 Offeror identify the standard steel mill item to be used in the manufacture of the contract item.</p><p class="depth0">3 Offeror insert best estimate of the number of days required for processing the standard steel mill item in the shop identified under the labor index definition.</p><p class="depth0">4 Offeror identify the shop and plant in which the standard steel mill item identified under the base steel index definition will be finally fabricated or processed into the contract item.</p><p class="depth0">5 Offeror insert the same percentage figures for the corresponding blanks in paragraphs (b), (e)(3)(i), and (e)(3)(ii). In paragraph (e)(3)(iii), insert the percentage representing the difference between the sum of the percentages inserted in paragraph (b) and 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0">6 In negotiated acquisitions of nonstandard steel items, when there is no established price or when it is not desirable to use this price, this paragraph may refer to another appropriate price basis, e.g., an established interplant price.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)
