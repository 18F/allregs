                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limitation of issues. The Appeals Council may limit the issues it considers if it notifies you and the other parties of the issues it will review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence. (1) The Appeals Council will consider all the evidence in the administrative law judge hearing record as well as any new and material evidence submitted to it which relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision. If you submit evidence which does not relate to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision, the Appeals Council will return the additional evidence to you with an explanation as to why it did not accept the additional evidence and will advise you of your right to file a new application. The notice returning the evidence to you will also advise you that if you file a new application within 6 months after the date of the Appeals Council's notice, your request for review will constitute a written statement indicating an intent to claim benefits in accordance with Sec. 404.630. If a new application is filed within 6 months of this notice, the date of the request for review will be used as the filing date for your application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Appeals Council will consider all the evidence in the administrative law judge hearing record as well as any new and material evidence submitted to it which relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision.

However, if the Appeals Council decides that it can obtain the evidence more quickly, it may do so, unless it will adversely affect your rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral argument. You may request to appear before the Appeals Council to present oral argument. The Appeals Council will grant your request if it decides that your case raises an important question of law or policy or that oral argument would help to reach a proper decision. If your request to appear is granted, the Appeals Council will tell you the time and place of the oral argument at least 10 days before the scheduled date.
