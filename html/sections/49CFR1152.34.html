                            <p class="depth0">Return on investment for road property shall be computed according to the procedures set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)-(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Return on investment--road properties. Return on investment--road properties shall be computed according to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The investment base to which the nominal return element shall apply shall be the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The allowable working capital computed at 15 days on-branch cash avoidable costs (on branch avoidable costs less depreciation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of current income tax benefits resulting from abandonment of the line which would have been applicable to the period of the subsidy

agreement. (Conversely, if the railroad would incur an income tax liability from abandonment, the liability should be deducted from the investment base.) This information is to be furnished by the railroad and subject to audit by the person offering the subsidy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The net liquidation value for the highest and best use for non-rail purposes of the rail properties on the line to be subsidized which are used and required for performance of the services requested by the persons offering the subsidy. This value shall be determined by computing the current appraised market value of such properties for other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of dismantling and disposition of improvements necessary to make the remaining properties available for their highest and best use and complying with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. If rehabilitation has been performed along the line during a subsidy year and rehabilitation expenses have been paid by the subsidizer under 49 CFR 1152.32(m)(2), the investment base shall exclude the increment to the net liquidation value of the line caused by the rehabilitation project. For these purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In calculating the net liquidation values for the Forecast Year, no asset on the line shall be excluded from the determination of net liquidation value because it contributes negatively to that value, i.e., the removal costs exceed the market value after removal. All such assets shall be included in the net liquidation value determination if the carrier is required by law to remove them or if the carrier intends to remove them, even if it is not required to do so. The parties shall fully support and explain the exclusion for net liquidation purposes of all assets having a negative salvage value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In calculating the net liquidation value of railroad properties for the purpose of determining the operating subsidy under an offer of financial assistance, any asset with a negative salvage value shall be included at a value of zero (0).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of the net liquidation value of rail properties for the purpose of purchasing the rail properties under an offer of financial assistance shall include any asset with a negative salvage value at a value of zero (0).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All adjustments to the appraised fair market value of right-of-way land, including a downward adjustment to reflect an imputed real estate Board or selling expense, shall be fully supported and explained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Parties shall fully support and explain their use of unadjusted across-the-fence (ATF) values as a surrogate for the value of railroad right-of-way land, given that the physical and economic characteristics (grading and elevation) usually are different from those of surrounding parcels. All adjustments to ATF values to arrive at the right-of-way values shall also be supported and explained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reasonable return. A rail carrier shall furnish to the Board, and to any financially responsible person considering making an offer of a rail service continuation payment, a substantiated statement showing its current nominal cost of capital. The railroad's nominal cost of capital shall be the current before tax cost of capital, weighted to the capital structure, and adjusted for the effects of the combined statutory Federal and state income tax rates. This rate of return expressed as a percent, shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The railroad shall determine its permanent capital structure ratio for debt and equity capital such that the two numbers total 100 percent. This capital structure will be the actual capital structure of the railroad. If this calculation is not possible or also not representative because the railroad is part of a conglomerate, the debt-equity ratio from the Board's latest Determination of Adequate Railroad Revenues will be used. However, if the debt-equity ratio for the railroad industry is used then the industry average equity and debt rate from the Board's latest revenue adequacy finding must also be used in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The current nominal cost of debt shall be determined by taking the average of all debt instruments (including bonds, equipment trust certificates, financial lease arrangements, et cetera) issued by the carrier in the most recent

12-month period. The debt cost calculated by this procedure is a before-tax rate and is not adjusted for inflation or income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The current nominal after tax cost of equity shall be an amount equal to that which a prudent investor would expect to earn through investment in the market place. The current after tax nominal cost of equity is divided by 1 minus the combined statutory Federal and state income tax rates. This will develop the nominal cost of equity on a before tax basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The current nominal before-tax cost of debt is multiplied by the current percentage of debt to total capital to obtain a weighted before-tax nominal cost of current debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The current nominal before-tax cost of equity is multiplied by the current percentage of equity to total capital to obtain a weighted nominal before-tax cost of current equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The results of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section are added together to determine the current nominal cost of capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Holding gain (loss)-road properties. The railroad shall determine the holding gain (loss) that is projected to occur during the forecast and/or subsidy year. In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically determined for road properties, the Gross Domestic Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used.
