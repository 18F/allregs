                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may provide in your tariff for the acceptance of charge or credit cards for the payment of freight charges. Accepting charge or credit card payments is different than extending credit to shippers in Sec. Sec. 375.219 and 375.807. Once you provide an estimate you are bound by the provisions in your tariff regarding payment as of the estimate date, until completion of any transaction that results from that estimate, unless otherwise agreed with a shipper under Sec. 375.217(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may accept charge or credit cards whenever shipments are transported under agreements and tariffs requiring payment by cash, certified check, money order, or a cashier's check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you allow an individual shipper to pay for a freight or expense bill by charge or credit card, you are deeming such payment to be the same as payment by cash, certified check, money order, or a cashier's check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The charge or credit card plans you participate in must be identified in your tariff rules as items permitting the acceptance of the charge or credit cards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an individual shipper causes a charge or credit card issuer to reverse a charge transaction, you may consider the individual shipper's action tantamount to forcing you to provide an involuntary extension of your credit. In such instances, the rules in Sec. 375.807 apply.</p>
