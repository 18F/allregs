                            <p class="depth0">The following refuge units have been opened for hunting and/or fishing, and are listed in alphabetical order with applicable refuge-specific regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge</p><p class="depth0">A. Migratory Game Bird Hunting. We allow hunting of goose, duck, brant, merganser, coot, woodcock, and snipe in accordance with State regulations subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">1. Waterfowl--For the hunting of goose, brant, duck, merganser, and coot we divide the refuge into six discrete waterfowl hunting units: the Delta Lakeshore Area, the Saxes Pothole/Creek and Shad Island Area, the Junior Waterfowl Hunting Area (including Long Marsh Bay, Patrick Marsh, and Charcoal Creek), the Long Marsh Channel and Metcalfe Island Area, and the Maquam Swamp Area. Conditions for each area are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. Delta Lakeshore Area includes lakeshore areas from Shad Island to the south side of Martindale Point but does not include Saxes Pothole/Creek and Shad Island Pothole.</p><p class="depth0">a.

This area is available to youth waterfowl hunters on Youth Waterfowl Hunting Weekend.</p><p class="depth0">e. We prohibit entering closed areas of the refuge for any reason, except for the recovery of legally harvested animals, and in that case you may not carry a weapon (see Sec.  27.42(a) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">f. Unarmed hunters may scout open hunting areas before a particular season opens but in no case before September 1. We do not require a hunting permit for scouting.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Maquam Shore Area encompasses a 30-acre area along the lakeshore of Maquam Bay and is bounded by private land on the west and a Vermont wildlife management area on the east. a. Conditions A1i(a-f) apply.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Saaxes Pothole/Creek and Shad Island Pothole encompasses Saxes Creek, Saxes Pothole, and Shad Island Pothole. This is a controlled hunting area. We stake and make available five zones (numbered 1-5) to five hunting parties in Saxe's Pothole, zone 6 is staked and available to one hunting party in Shad Island Pothole.</p><p class="depth0">a. A hunting party consists of the hunter named on the permit and one guest hunter per zone per day. Nonhunters may accompany a hunting party.</p><p class="depth0">b. Each hunting party must possess and carry a permit for the specific zone on the specific day they are hunting in this area. Permits are not transferable.</p><p class="depth0">c. You may obtain permits for the period from the opening day of duck hunting season through the first Sunday of the duck hunting season, and for the second weekend of the duck hunting season through application to a preseason lottery. During the years when the State elects to have a split season, you may also obtain your permits for the second opening day through the following Sunday through application to the preseason lottery. On all other hunt days, you must acquire permits through self-registration at the Mac's Bend Landing no earlier than 2 hours before legal shooting time on the day of the hunt.</p><p class="depth0">d. Hunters selected during the preseason lottery must pay a $10 fee. The refuge must receive the fee no earlier than 2 days before the opening of the season or forfeit the permit, which we will then make available to other hunters on a first-come, first-served basis. The fee is paid for any permit assigned before the day of the hunt. There is no fee for any permit obtained on the day of the hunt.</p><p class="depth0">e. On those days that we draw permits by preseason lottery, hunters must sign in at the Mac's Bend Landing by 7 a.m. before going to the assigned zone. After 7 a.m. other hunters may sign in, self-register, and use unoccupied zones.</p><p class="depth0">f. At the end of each daily hunt, you must sign out and deposit a report of hunt success at the Mac's Bend Landing. When you sign out, another party may sign in and use the vacated zone.

The 11 blind sites are available exclusively to these junior waterfowl hunters and their mentors the first 4 Saturdays and Sundays of the duck season.</p><p class="depth0">b. As an incentive to the adult volunteers who serve as mentors to junior waterfowl hunters, they will vie for blind site assignments during a lottery drawing at the conclusion of the annual junior waterfowl hunter training for the use of blind sites in the junior hunt area on the first Wednesday following the second weekend of the season. This day is known as Mentor Day. We will collect no fee from mentors for this hunt day.
