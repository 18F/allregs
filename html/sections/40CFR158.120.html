                            <p class="depth0">As with current practice, the actual data and studies required may be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and properties of specific pesticide products under review. While EPA is attempting to assist the applicant in this subpart, it is important to emphasize that it is the applicant's obligation under FIFRA to demonstrate that an individual product meets the standard under FIFRA and/or FFDCA. Accordingly, applicants are encouraged to consult with the Agency on the appropriate data requirements as set forth here as they relate to their specific product prior to and during the registration process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Finding the appropriate data table. (1) Pesticide data requirements for conventional chemical active ingredients and related substances are presented in subparts D, E, F, G, K, L, N, and O of this part in the form of a series of data tables, each addressing a particular scientific discipline or data topic. Data requirements for biochemical and microbial pest control agents are contained and are described separately within subparts U and V of this part, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pesticide data requirements for conventional chemical active ingredients and related substances are presented in subparts D, E, F, G, K, L, N, and O of this part in the form of a series of data tables, each addressing a particular scientific discipline or data topic. Data requirements for biochemical and microbial pest control agents are contained and are described separately within subparts U and V of this part, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Key to table notations. R = required data; CR = conditionally required data; NR = Not required; MP = manufacturing-use product; EP = end-use product; TEP = typical end-use product; TGAI = technical grade of the active ingredient; PAI = pure active ingredient; PAIRA = pure active ingredient, radiolabeled; Choice = choice of several test substances depending on studies required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identifying required studies. To determine the specific kinds of data needed to support the registration use of each pesticide product, the applicant may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refer to the applicable subpart(s) of this part. These subparts describe the data requirements including data tables for each subject area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Select the general use pattern(s) that best cover the use pattern(s) specified on the pesticide product label as explained in Sec. 158.100. All applicable use patterns must be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proceed down the appropriate general use pattern column in the table and note which tests are required (R), conditionally required (CR), or not required (NR). Required and conditionally required studies are described in Sec. 158.110.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review the notes for each requirement to determine its applicability to the specific product proposed for registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em> Proceed down the Test substance columns and determine the appropriate test substance needed for that study. If the data are intended to support a manufacturing-use product, use the MP column. If the data are intended to support an end-use product, use the EP column.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proceed down the Test substance columns and determine the appropriate test substance needed for that study. If the data are intended to support a manufacturing-use product, use the MP column. If the data are intended to support an end-use product, use the EP column.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The test substances columns specify which substance is to be used for testing. Applicants should note that the substance that must be used when performing the study may or may not be the product itself. For example, the data from a certain study may be required to support the registration of an end-use product, but the test substance column may state that the particular test shall be performed using the technical grade of the active ingredient(s) in the end-use product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturing-use products (MP) and end-use products (EP) containing a single active ingredient and no intentionally added inert ingredients are considered identical in composition to each other, and to the technical grade of the active ingredient (TGAI) from which they were derived. Therefore, the data from a test conducted using any one of these as the test substance is also suitable to meet the requirement (if any) for the same test to be conducted using either of the other substances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Refer to the Pesticide Assessment Guideline reference number for each study located in the first column. See Sec. 158.70(c) for information pertaining to the guidelines and how to obtain copies.</p>
