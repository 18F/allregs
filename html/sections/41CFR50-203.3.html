It shall  specifically deny or admit each of the charges, and, if the answer is in  denial of any one of the charges, it shall contain a concise statement  of the facts relied upon in support of the denial. Any charges not  specifically denied in the answer shall be deemed to be admitted and may  be so found by the administrative law judge, unless the respondent  disclaims knowledge upon which to make a denial. If the answer should  admit any charge but the respondent believes there are reasons or  circumstances warranting special consideration, such reasons and  circumstances should be fully but concisely stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such answer shall be in writing, and signed by the respondent or  his attorney or by any other duly authorized agent with power of  attorney affixed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no answer is filed, or if the answer as filed does not  warrant a postponement of the hearing, such hearing will be held as  scheduled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The original and two copies of the answer shall be filed with  the Chief administrative law judge, Department of Labor, Washington,  D.C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In any case where formal complaints have been amended, the  respondent shall have the right to amend his answer within such time as  may be fixed by the administrative law judge.
