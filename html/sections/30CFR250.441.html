                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When you drill with a surface BOP stack, you must install the BOP system before drilling below surface casing. The surface BOP stack must include at least four remote-controlled, hydraulically operated BOPs, consisting of an annular BOP, two BOPs equipped with pipe rams, and one BOP equipped with blind or blind-shear rams.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your surface BOP stack must include at least four remote-controlled, hydraulically operated BOPs consisting of an annular BOP, two BOPs equipped with pipe rams, and one BOP equipped with blind-shear rams. The blind-shear rams must be capable of shearing the drill pipe that is in the hole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must install an accumulator system that provides 1.5 times the volume of fluid capacity necessary to close and hold closed all BOP components. The system must perform with a minimum pressure of 200 psi above the precharge pressure without assistance from a charging system. If you supply the accumulator regulators by rig air and do not have a secondary source of pneumatic supply, you must equip the regulators with manual overrides or

other devices to ensure capability of hydraulic operations if rig air is lost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the stack and accumulator system, you must install the associated BOP systems and equipment required by the regulations in this subpart.</p>
