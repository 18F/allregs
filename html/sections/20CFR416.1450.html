                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The right to appear and present evidence. Any party to a hearing  has a right to appear before the administrative law judge, either in  person, or, when the conditions in Sec. 416.1436(c)(1) exist, by video  teleconferencing or telephone, to present evidence and to state his or  her position. A party may also make his or her appearance by means of a  designated representative, who may make the appearance in person, or,  when the conditions in Sec. 416.1436(c)(1) exist, by video  teleconferencing or telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver of the right to appear. You may send the administrative  law judge a waiver or a written statement indicating that you do not  wish to appear at the hearing. You may withdraw this waiver any time  before a notice of the hearing decision is mailed to you. Even if all of  the parties waive their right to appear at a hearing, we may notify them  of a time and a place for an oral hearing, if the administrative law  judge believes that a personal appearance and testimony by you or any  other party is necessary to decide the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What evidence is admissible at a hearing. The administrative law  judge may receive evidence at the hearing even though the evidence would  not be admissible in court under the rules of evidence used by the  court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpoenas. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When it is reasonably necessary for the full  presentation of a case, an administrative law judge or a member of the  Appeals Council may, on his or her own initiative or at the request of a  party, issue subpoenas for the appearance and testimony of witnesses and  for the production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other  documents that are material to an issue at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties to a hearing who wish to subpoena documents or witnesses  must file a written request for the issuance of a subpoena with the  administrative law judge or at one of our offices at least 5 days before  the hearing date. The written request must give the names of the  witnesses or documents to be produced; describe the address or location  of the witnesses or documents with sufficient detail to find them; state  the important facts that the witness or document is expected to prove;  and indicate why these facts could not be proven without issuing a  subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We will pay the cost of issuing the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We will pay subpoenaed witnesses the same fees and mileage they  would receive if they had been subpoenaed by a Federal district court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Witnesses at a hearing. Witnesses may appear at a hearing in  person or, when the conditions in Sec. 416.1436(c)(2) exist, by video  teleconferencing or telephone. They will testify under oath or  affirmation unless the administrative law judge finds an important  reason to excuse them from taking an oath or affirmation. The  administrative law judge may ask the witness any questions material to  the issues and will allow the parties or their designated  representatives to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Collateral estoppel--issues previously decided. An issue at your  hearing may be a fact that has already been decided in one of our  previous determinations or decisions in a claim involving the   same parties, but arising under a different title of the Act or under  the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act. If this happens, the  administrative law judge will not consider the issue again, but will  accept the factual finding made in the previous determination or  decision unless there are reasons to believe that it was wrong.
