This appendix contains four model forms for risk-based pricing  notices and three model forms for use in connection with the credit  score disclosure exceptions. Each of the model forms is designated for  use in a particular set of circumstances as indicated by the title of  that model form.</p><p class="depth0">2. Model form B-1 is for use in complying with the general risk- based pricing notice requirements in Sec. 640.3 if a credit score is  not used in setting the material terms of credit. Model form B-2 is for  risk-based pricing notices given in connection with account review if a  credit score is not used in increasing the annual percentage rate. Model  form B-3 is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure  exception for loans secured by residential real property. Model form B-4  is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exception for  loans that are not secured by residential real property. Model form B-5  is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exception when  no credit score is available for a consumer. Model form B-6 is for use  in complying with the general risk-based pricing notice requirements in  Sec. 640.3 if a credit score is used in setting the material terms of  credit. Model form B-7 is for risk-based pricing notices given in  connection with account review if a credit score is used in increasing  the annual percentage rate. All forms contained in this appendix are  models; their use is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. A person may change the forms by rearranging the format or by  making technical modifications to the language of the forms, in each  case without modifying the substance of the disclosures. Any such  rearrangement or modification of the language of the model forms may not  be so extensive as to materially affect the substance, clarity,  comprehensibility, or meaningful sequence of the forms. Persons making  revisions with that effect will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for  appropriate use of Appendix B model forms. A person is not required to  conduct consumer testing when rearranging the format of the model forms.</p><p class="depth0">a. Acceptable changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Corrections or updates to telephone numbers, mailing addresses,  or web site addresses that may change over time.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The addition of graphics or icons, such as the person's  corporate logo.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Alteration of the shading or color contained in the model  forms.</p><p class="depth0">iv.

Optional language in model forms B-6 and B-7 may be used to  direct the consumer to the entity (which may be a consumer reporting  agency or the creditor itself, for a proprietary score that meets the  definition of a credit score) that provided the credit score for any  questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact  information.

These changes may not be so extensive as to affect  the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the  model forms.

Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for  ``credit card,'' ``insurance,'' or ``securities'' affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable.

Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to  opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make  solicitations to them.</p><p class="depth0">7.
