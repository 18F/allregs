                                Sec. 2418.14  How will the FLRA report FLRA debts to credit bureaus?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The FLRA shall report delinquent FLRA debts to credit bureaus in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), 31 CFR 901.4, and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Nontax Receivables.'' For additional information, see Financial Management Service's ``Guide to the Federal Credit Bureau Program,'' which may be found at http://www.fms.treas.gov/debt. At least sixty (60) days prior to reporting a delinquent debt to a consumer-reporting agency, the FLRA will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 2418.4. Before disclosing information to a consumer-reporting agency, the FLRA shall provide, on request of a person alleged to be responsible for the delinquent debt, for a review of the obligation of the

debtor, including an opportunity for reconsideration of the initial decision on the debt. The FLRA may authorize the Financial Management Service to report to credit bureaus those delinquent FLRA debts that have been transferred to the Financial Management Service under Sec. 2418.9.</p>
