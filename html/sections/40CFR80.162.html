                            <p class="depth0">For a detergent additive product to be eligible for use by detergent  blenders in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this  subpart, the compositional data to be supplied to EPA by the additive  manufacturer for the purpose of registering a detergent additive package  under Sec. 79.21(a) of this chapter must include the items listed in  this section. In the case of items requiring measurement or other  technical analysis, and for which a specific test procedure is not  stipulated herein, the procedure must conform to reasonable and  customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable  and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the type of test  procedure or analytic procedure in question. At EPA's request, detailed  documentation of any such test procedure must be submitted within 10  days of the registrant's receipt of EPA's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive  package and the weight and/or volume percent (as applicable) of each  component of the package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When possible, standard chemical nomenclature shall be used or  the chemical structure of the component shall be given. Polymeric  components may be reported as the product of other chemical reactants,  provided that the supporting data specified in paragraph (b) of this  section is also reported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each detergent-active component of the package shall be  classified into one of the following designations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Polyalkyl amine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polyether amine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Polyalkylsuccinimide;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Polyalkylaminophenol;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Detergent-active petroleum-based carrier oil;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Detergent-active synthetic carrier oil; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Other detergent-active component (identify category, if  feasible.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Composition variability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The composition of a detergent additive reported in a single  additive registration (and the detergent additive product sold under a  single additive registration) may not:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Include detergent-active components which differ in identity  from those contained in the detergent additive package at the time of  certification testing; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Include a range of concentration for any detergent-active  component such that, if the component were present in the detergent  additive package at the lower bound of the reported range, the deposit  control effectiveness   of the additive package would be reduced as compared with the level of  effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing. Subject to the  foregoing constraint, a detergent additive product sold under a  particular additive registration may contain a higher concentration of  the detergent-active component(s) than the concentration(s) of such  component(s) reported in the registration for the additive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active  components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single  registration provided that such variability does not reduce the deposit  control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level  of effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Unless the additive manufacturer (or other certifying party)  provides EPA with data to substantiate that a carrier oil does not act  to enhance the detergent additive package's ability to control deposits,  any carrier oil contained in the detergent additive package, whether  petroleum-based or synthetic, must be treated as a detergent-active  component in accordance with the additive compositional reporting  requirements in Sec. 80.162(a)(2). Such data should be sent by certified  mail to the address specified in Sec. 80.174(b).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section,  detergent additive packages which do not satisfy the restrictions in  this paragraph (a)(3) must be separately registered. EPA may disqualify  an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart if  EPA determines that the variability included within a given detergent  additive registration may reduce the deposit control effectiveness of  the detergent package such that it may invalidate the minimum  recommended concentration reported in accordance with the applicable  requirements of Sec. 80.161(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a  modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new  detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its  own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share  common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not  sold or transferred to other parties; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose  of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a  rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended  concentration, taking into account the dilution; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the  dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the  diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change  in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time  period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or  faxed to the address in Sec. 80.174(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For detergent-active polymers and detergent-active carrier oils  which are reported as the product of other chemical reactants:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the reactant materials and the manufacturer's  acceptance criteria for determining that these materials are suitable  for use in synthesizing detergent components. The manufacturer must  maintain documentation, and submit it to EPA upon request, demonstrating  that the acceptance criteria reported to EPA are the same criteria which  the manufacturer specifies to the suppliers of the reactant materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC), providing the molecular  weight distribution of the polymer or detergent-active carrier oil  components and the concentration of each chromatographic peak  representing more than one percent of the total mass. For these results  to be acceptable, the GPC test procedure must include equipment  calibration with a polystyrene standard or other readily attainable and  generally accepted calibration standard. The identity of the calibration  standard must be provided, together with the GPC characterization of the  standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For non-detergent-active carrier oils, the following parameters:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> T10, T50, and T90 distillation points, and end boiling point,  measured according to applicable test procedures cited in Sec. 80.46.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> API gravity and viscosity</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Concentration of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, if greater than  or equal to 0.5 percent (by weight) of the carrier oil</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Description of an FTIR-based method appropriate for identifying  the detergent additive package and its detergent-active components  (polymers, carrier oils, and others) both qualitatively and  quantitatively, together with the actual infrared spectra of the  detergent additive package and each detergent-active component obtained  by this test method. The FTIR infrared spectra submitted in connection  with the registration of a detergent additive package must reflect the  results of a test conducted on a sample of the additive containing the  detergent-active component(s) at a concentration no lower than the  concentration(s) (or the lower bound of a range of concentration)  reported in the registration pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To provide a basis for establishing an affirmative defense to  presumptive liability pursuant to Sec. 80.169(c)(4)(i)(D)(2)(i),  specific physical parameters must be identified which the manufacturer  considers adequate and appropriate, in combination with other  information and sampling requirements under this subpart, for  identifying the detergent additive package and monitoring its production  quality control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such parameters shall include (but need not be limited to)  viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, unless the additive  manufacturer specifically requests, and EPA approves, the substitution  of other parameter(s) which the manufacturer considers to be more  appropriate for a particular additive package. The request must be made  in writing and must include an explanation of how the requested physical  parameter(s) are helpful as indicator(s) of detergent production quality  control. EPA will respond to such requests in writing; the additional  parameters are not approved until the certifier receives EPA's written  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer shall identify a standardized measurement  method, consistent with the chemical and physical nature of the  detergent product, which will be used to measure each parameter. The  documented ASTM repeatability for the method shall also be cited. The  manufacturer's target value for each parameter in the detergent package,  and the expected range of production values for each parameter, shall be  specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EPA will consider the parameter measurements to be an acceptable  basis for establishing an affirmative defense to presumptive liability,  if the expected range of variability differs from the target value by an  amount no greater than five times the standard repeatability of the test  procedure, or by no more than 10 percent of the target value, whichever  is less. However, in the case of nitrogen analysis or other procedures  for measuring concentrations of specific chemical compounds or elements,  when the target value is less than 10 parts per million, a range of  variability up to 50 percent of the target value will be considered  acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a manufacturer wishes to rely on measurement methods or  production variability ranges which do not conform to the above  limitations, then the manufacturer must receive prior written approval  from EPA in order to be assured that any related parameter measurements  will be considered an acceptable basis for establishing an affirmative  defense. A request for such allowance must be made in writing. It must  fully justify the adequacy of the test procedure, explain why a broader  range of variability is required, and provide evidence that the  production detergent will perform adequately throughout the requested  range of variability.
