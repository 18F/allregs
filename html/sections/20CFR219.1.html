This part contains the basic rules for evidence that is required to  support a claimant's claim for monthly or lump-sum benefit payments  under the Railroad Retirement Act. Part 219 describes when evidence is  required and what types of documents can be used as evidence. Part 222  defines and explains family relationships for which evidence  requirements are stated in part 219. Special evidence requirements for  disability annuities are found in part 220 of this chapter.</p>
