Where:
X1 = the PM CPMS data points for all runs i,n = the number of data points, andOh = your site specific operating limit, in milliamps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (milliamps) on a 30-day rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new operating hour. Use Equation 14 to determine the 30-day rolling average.

For each performance test, conduct three separate runs under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur. Conduct each test run to collect a minimum sample volume specified in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, as applicable, for determining compliance with a new source limit or an existing source limit. Calculate the average of the results from three runs to determine compliance. You need not determine the PM collected in the impingers (``back half'') of the Method 5 particulate sampling train to demonstrate compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. This shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of the ``back half'' for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g. beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run. (iii) For a particulate wet scrubber, you must establish the minimum pressure drop and liquid flow rate as defined in Sec. 63.7575, as your operating limits during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit. If you use a wet scrubber and you conduct separate performance tests for PM and TSM emissions, you must establish one set of minimum scrubber liquid flow rate and pressure drop operating limits. The minimum scrubber effluent pH operating limit must be established during the HCl performance test. If you conduct multiple performance tests, you must set the minimum liquid flow rate and pressure drop operating limits at the higher of the minimum values established during the performance tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated with a wet scrubber, you must establish the minimum total secondary electric power input, as defined in Sec. 63.7575, as your operating limit during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit.
