The requirement of paragraph (1) of Sec. 129.6(a), relating to the source of the water supply, shall be waived, and such facility shall be eligible to apply for a credit under Sec. 129.6, upon a showing by the owner or operator of such facility to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) that the concentration of PCBs in the intake water supply of such facility does not exceed the concentration of PCBs in the receiving water body to which the plant discharges its effluent.
