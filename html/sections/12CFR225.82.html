                                Sec. 225.82  How does a bank holding company elect to become a financial
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Filing requirement. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company by filing a written declaration with the appropriate Reserve Bank. A declaration by a bank holding company is considered to be filed on the date that all information required by paragraph (b) of this section is received by the appropriate Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contents of declaration. To be deemed complete, a declaration must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State that the bank holding company elects to be a financial holding company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide the name and head office address of the bank holding company and of each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certify that each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company is well capitalized as of the date the bank holding company submits its declaration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide the capital ratios as of the close of the previous quarter for all relevant capital measures, as defined in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o), for each depository institution controlled by the company on the date the company submits its declaration; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certify that each depository institution controlled by the company is well managed as of the date the company submits its declaration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effectiveness of election. An election by a bank holding company to become a financial holding company shall not be effective if, during the period provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the Board finds that, as of the date the declaration was filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any insured depository institution controlled by the bank holding company (except an institution excluded under paragraph (d) of this section) has not achieved at least a rating of ``satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs'' under the Community Reinvestment Act at the institution's most recent examination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any depository institution controlled by the bank holding company is not both well capitalized and well managed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consideration of the CRA performance of a recently acquired insured depository institution. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an insured depository institution will be excluded for purposes of the review of the Community Reinvestment Act rating provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The bank holding company acquired the insured depository institution during the 12-month period preceding the filing of an election under paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The bank holding company has submitted an affirmative plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency for the institution to take actions necessary for the institution to achieve at least a rating of ``satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs'' under the Community Reinvestment Act at the next examination of the institution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The appropriate Federal banking agency for the institution has accepted the plan described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date of election--(1) In general. An election filed by a bank holding company under paragraph (a) of this section is effective on the 31st

calendar day after the date that a complete declaration was filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank, unless the Board notifies the bank holding company prior to that time that the election is ineffective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Earlier notification that an election is effective. The Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank may notify a bank holding company that its election to become a financial holding company is effective prior to the 31st day after the date that a complete declaration was filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank. Such a notification must be in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Requests to become a financial holding company submitted as part of an application to become a bank holding company--(1) In general. A company that is not a bank holding company and has applied for the Board's approval to become a bank holding company under section 3(a)(1) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) may as part of that application submit a request to become a financial holding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of request. A request to become a financial holding company submitted as part of an application to become a bank holding company must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State that the company seeks to become a financial holding company on consummation of its proposal to become a bank holding company; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certify that each depository institution that would be controlled by the company on consummation of its proposal to become a bank holding company will be both well capitalized and well managed as of the date the company consummates the proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Request becomes a declaration and an effective election on date of consummation of bank holding company proposal. A complete request submitted by a company under this paragraph (f) becomes a complete declaration by a bank holding company for purposes of section 4(l) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(l)) and becomes an effective election for purposes of Sec. 225.81(b) on the date that the company lawfully consummates its proposal under section 3 of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1842), unless the Board notifies the company at any time prior to consummation of the proposal and that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any depository institution that would be controlled by the company on consummation of the proposal will not be both well capitalized and well managed on the date of consummation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any insured depository institution that would be controlled by the company on consummation of the proposal has not achieved at least a rating of ``satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs'' under the Community Reinvestment Act at the institution's most recent examination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limited exclusion for recently acquired institutions not available. Unless the Board determines otherwise, an insured depository institution that is controlled or would be controlled by the company as part of its proposal to become a bank holding company may not be excluded for purposes of evaluating the Community Reinvestment Act criterion described in this paragraph or in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Board's authority to exercise supervisory authority over a financial holding company. An effective election to become a financial holding company does not in any way limit the Board's statutory authority under the BHC Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any other relevant Federal statute to take appropriate action, including imposing supervisory limitations, restrictions, or prohibitions on the activities and acquisitions of a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company, or enforcing compliance with applicable law.</p>
