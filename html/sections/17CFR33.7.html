                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 1.65 of this chapter, no futures  commission merchant, or in the case of an introduced account no  introducing broker,   may open or cause the opening of a commodity option account for an  option customer, other than for a customer specified in Sec. 1.55(f) of  this chapter, unless the futures commission merchant or introducing  broker first:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Furnishes the option customer with a separate written disclosure  statement as set forth in this section or another statement approved  under Sec. 1.55(c) of this chapter and set forth in appendix A to Sec.  1.55 which the Commission finds satisfies this requirement, or includes  either such statement in a booklet containing the customer account  agreement and other disclosure statements required by Commission rules;  provided, however, that if the statement contained in Sec. 33.7 is used  it must follow the statement required by Sec. 1.55; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.55(d) of this chapter,  receives from the option customer an acknowledgment signed and dated by  the option customer that he received and understood the disclosure  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The disclosure statement and the acknowledgment shall be  retained by the futures commission merchant or the introducing broker in  accordance with Sec. 1.31 of this chapter. The disclosure statement  must be as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, typed or printed  in type of not less than 10-point size, and, where indicated, in all  capital letters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The disclosure statement must read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Options Disclosure Statement</p><p class="depth0">BECAUSE OF THE VOLATILE NATURE OF THE COMMODITIES MARKETS, THE  PURCHASE AND GRANTING OF COMMODITY OPTIONS INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF  RISK. COMMODITY OPTION TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF  THE PUBLIC. SUCH TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO ONLY BY PERSONS WHO  HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND WHO UNDERSTAND  THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THEIR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND OF THE RISKS  INVOLVED IN THE OPTION TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS DISCLOSURE  STATEMENT. BOTH THE PURCHASER AND THE GRANTOR SHOULD KNOW THAT THE OPTION IF  EXERCISED, RESULTS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FUTURES CONTRACT (AN  ``OPTION ON A FUTURES CONTRACT'').</p><p class="depth0">BOTH THE PURCHASER AND THE GRANTOR SHOULD KNOW WHETHER THE  PARTICULAR OPTION IN WHICH THEY CONTEMPLATE TRADING IS SUBJECT TO A  ``STOCK-STYLE'' OR ``FUTURES-STYLE'' SYSTEM OF MARGINING. UNDER A STOCK- STYLE MARGINING SYSTEM, A PURCHASER IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE FULL PURCHASE  PRICE OF THE OPTION AT THE INITIATION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE PURCHASER  HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATION ON THE OPTION POSITION. UNDER A FUTURES-STYLE  MARGINING SYSTEM, THE PURCHASER DEPOSITS INITIAL MARGIN AND MAY BE  REQUIRED TO DEPOSIT ADDITIONAL MARGIN IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST THE  OPTION POSITION. THE PURCHASER'S TOTAL SETTLEMENT VARIATION MARGIN  OBLIGATION OVER THE LIFE OF THE OPTION, HOWEVER, WILL NOT EXCEED THE  ORIGINAL OPTION PREMIUM, ALTHOUGH SOME INDIVIDUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS  AND/OR RISK MARGIN REQUIREMENTS MAY AT TIMES EXCEED THE ORIGINAL OPTION  PREMIUM. IF THE PURCHASER OR GRANTOR DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW OPTIONS ARE  MARGINED UNDER A STOCK-STYLE OR FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING SYSTEM, HE OR  SHE SHOULD REQUEST AN EXPLANATION FROM THE FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT  (``FCM'') OR INTRODUCING BROKER (``IB'').</p><p class="depth0">A PERSON SHOULD NOT PURCHASE ANY COMMODITY OPTION UNLESS HE OR SHE  IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND TRANSACTION COSTS OF  PURCHASING THE OPTION. A PERSON SHOULD NOT GRANT ANY COMMODITY OPTION  UNLESS HE OR SHE IS ABLE TO MEET ADDITIONAL CALLS FOR MARGIN WHEN THE  MARKET MOVES AGAINST HIS OR HER POSITION AND, IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, TO  SUSTAIN A VERY LARGE FINANCIAL LOSS.</p><p class="depth0">A PERSON WHO PURCHASES AN OPTION SUBJECT TO STOCK-STYLE MARGINING  SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM THE OPTION, IT  WILL BE NECESSARY EITHER TO OFFSET THE OPTION POSITION OR TO EXERCISE  THE OPTION. OPTIONS SUBJECT TO FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING ARE MARKED TO  MARKET, AND GAINS AND LOSSES ARE PAID AND COLLECTED DAILY. IF AN OPTION  PURCHASER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO OFFSET OR EXERCISE AN OPTION, THE  PURCHASER SHOULD REQUEST AN EXPLANATION FROM THE FCM OR IB. CUSTOMERS  SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH   WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR  IMPOSSIBLE TO OFFSET AN EXISTING OPTION POSITION ON AN EXCHANGE.</p><p class="depth0">THE GRANTOR OF AN OPTION SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, IN MOST CASES, A  COMMODITY OPTION MAY BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME FROM THE TIME IT IS  GRANTED UNTIL IT EXPIRES. THE PURCHASER OF AN OPTION SHOULD BE AWARE  THAT SOME OPTION CONTRACTS MAY PROVIDE ONLY A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME FOR  EXERCISE OF THE OPTION.</p><p class="depth0">THE PURCHASER OF A PUT OR CALL SUBJECT TO STOCK-STYLE OR FUTURES- STYLE MARGINING IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSING THE ENTIRE PURCHASE  PRICE OF THE OPTION--THAT IS, THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THE OPTION PLUS  ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.</p><p class="depth0">THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT ALL CUSTOMERS  RECEIVE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  BUT DOES NOT INTEND THIS STATEMENT AS A RECOMMENDATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF  EXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY OPTIONS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Some of the risks of option trading.</p><p class="depth0">Specific market movements of the underlying future cannot be  predicted accurately.</p><p class="depth0">The grantor of a call option who does not have a long position in  the underlying futures contract is subject to risk of loss should the  price of the underlying futures contract be higher than the strike price  upon exercise or expiration of the option by an amount greater than the  premium received for granting the call option.</p><p class="depth0">The grantor of a call option who has a long position in the  underlying futures contract is subject to the full risk of a decline in  price of the underlying position reduced by the premium received for  granting the call. In exchange for the premium received for granting a  call option, the option grantor gives up all of the potential gain  resulting from an increase in the price of the underlying futures  contract above the option strike price upon exercise or expiration of  the option.</p><p class="depth0">The grantor of a put option who does not have a short position in  the underlying futures contract is subject to risk of loss should the  price of the underlying futures contract decrease below the strike price  upon exercise or expiration of the option by an amount in excess of the  premium received for granting the put option.</p><p class="depth0">The grantor of a put option on a futures contract who has a short  position in the underlying futures contract is subject to the full risk  of a rise in the price in the underlying position reduced by the premium  received for granting the put. In exchange for the premium received for  granting a put option on a futures contract, the option grantor gives up  all of the potential gain resulting from a decrease in the price of the  underlying futures contract below the option strike price upon exercise  or expiration of the option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of commodity options. Prior to entering into any  transaction involving a commodity option, an individual should  thoroughly understand the nature and type of option involved and the  underlying futures contract. The futures commission merchant or  introducing broker is required to provide, and the individual  contemplating an option transaction should obtain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An identification of the futures contract underlying the option  and which may be purchased or sold upon exercise of the option or, if  applicable, whether exercise of the option will be settled in cash;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The procedure for exercise of the option contract, including  the expiration date and latest time on that date for exercise. (The  latest time on an expiration date when an option may be exercised may  vary; therefore, option market participants should ascertain from their  futures commission merchant or their introducing broker the latest time  the firm accepts exercise instructions with respect to a particular  option.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the purchase price of the option including  the premium, commissions, costs, fees and other charges. (Since  commissions and other charges may vary widely among futures commission  merchants and among introducing brokers, option customers may find it  advisable to consult more than one firm when opening an option  account.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of all costs in addition to the purchase price  which may be incurred if the commodity option is exercised, including  the amount of commissions (whether termed sales commissions or  otherwise), storage, interest, and all similar fees and charges which  may be incurred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An explanation and understanding of the option margining system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A clear explanation and understanding of any clauses in the  option contract and of any items included in the option contract  explicitly or by reference which might affect the customer's obligations  under the contract. This would include any policy of the futures  commission merchant or the introducing broker or rule of the exchange on  which the option is traded that might affect the customer's ability to  fulfill the option contract or to offset the option position in a  closing purchase or closing sale transaction (for example, due to  unforeseen circumstances that require suspension or termination of  trading); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If applicable, a description of the effect upon the value of  the option position   that could result from limit moves in the underlying futures contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The mechanics of option trading. Before entering into any  exchange-traded option transaction, an individual should obtain a  description of how commodity options are traded.</p><p class="depth0">Option customers should clearly understand that there is no  guarantee that option positions may be offset by either a closing  purchase or closing sale transaction on an exchange. In this  circumstance, option grantors could be subject to the full risk of their  positions until the option position expires, and the purchaser of a  profitable option might have to exercise the option to realize a profit.</p><p class="depth0">For an option on a futures contract, an individual should clearly  understand the relationship between exchange rules governing option  transactions and exchange rules governing the underlying futures  contract. For example, an individual should understand what action, if  any, the exchange will take in the option market if trading in the  underlying futures market is restricted or the futures prices have made  a ``limit move.''</p><p class="depth0">The individual should understand that the option may not be subject  to daily price fluctuation limits while the underlying futures may have  such limits, and, as a result, normal pricing relationships between  options and the underlying future may not exist when the future is  trading at its price limit. Also, underlying futures positions resulting  from exercise of options may not be capable of being offset if the  underlying future is at a price limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Margin requirements. An individual should know and understand  whether the option he or she is contemplating trading is subject to a  stock-style or futures-style system of margining. Stock-style margining  requires the purchaser to pay the full option premium at the time of  purchase. The purchaser has no further financial obligations, and the  risk of loss is limited to the purchase price and transaction costs.  Futures-style margining requires the purchaser to pay initial margin  only at the time of purchase. The option position is marked to market,  and gains and losses are collected and paid daily. The purchaser's risk  of loss is limited to the initial option premium and transaction costs.</p><p class="depth0">An individual granting options under either a stock-style or  futures-style system of margining should understand that he or she may  be required to pay additional margin in the case of adverse market  movements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Profit potential of an option position. An option customer  should carefully calculate the price which the underlying futures  contract would have to reach for the option position to become  profitable. Under a stock-style margining system, this price would  include the amount by which the underlying futures contract would have  to rise above or fall below the strike price to cover the sum of the  premium and all other costs incurred in entering into and exercising or  closing (offsetting) the commodity option position. Under a future-style  margining system, option positions would be marked to market, and gains  and losses would be paid and collected daily, and an option position  would become profitable once the variation margin collected exceeded the  cost of entering the contract position.</p><p class="depth0">Also, an option customer should be aware of the risk that the  futures price prevailing at the opening of the next trading day may be  substantially different from the futures price which prevailed when the  option was exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Deep-out-of-the-money options. A person contemplating purchasing  a deep-out-of-the-money option (that is, an option with a strike price  significantly above, in the case of a call, or significantly below, in  the case of a put, the current price of the underlying futures contract)  should be aware that the chance of such an option becoming profitable is  ordinarily remote.</p><p class="depth0">On the other hand, a potential grantor of a deep-out-of-the-money  option should be aware that such options normally provide small premiums  while exposing the grantor to all of the potential losses described in  section (1) of this disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Glossary of terms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contract market. Any board of trade  (exchange) located in the United States which has been designated by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission to list a futures contract or  commodity option for trading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exchange-traded option; put option; call option. The options  discussed in this disclosure statement are limited to those which may be  traded on a contract market. These options (subject to certain  exceptions) give an option purchaser the right to buy in the case of a  call option, or to sell in the case of a put option, a futures contract  underlying the option at the stated strike price prior to the expiration  date of the option. Each exchange-traded option is distinguished by the  underlying futures contract, strike price, expiration date, and whether  the option is a put or a call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Underlying futures contract. The futures contract which may be  purchased or sold upon the exercise of an option on a futures contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Class of options. A put or a call covering the same underlying  futures contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Series of options. Options of the same class having the same  strike price and expiration date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Exercise price. See strike price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Expiration date. The last day when an option may be  exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Premium. The amount agreed upon between the purchaser and  seller for the purchase or sale of a commodity option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Strike price. The price at which a person may purchase or sell  the underlying futures contract upon exercise of a commodity option.  This term has the same meaning as the term ``exercise price.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Short option position. See opening sale transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Long option position. See opening purchase transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Types of options transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Opening purchase  transaction. A transaction in which an individual purchases an option  and thereby obtains a long option position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Opening sale transaction. A transaction in which an individual  grants an option and thereby obtains a short option position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Closing purchase transaction. A transaction in which an  individual with a short option position liquidates the position. This is  accomplished by a closing purchase transaction for an option of the same  series as the option previously granted. Such a transaction may be  referred to as an offset transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Closing sale transaction. A transaction in which an individual  with a long option position liquidates the position. This is  accomplished by a closing sale transaction for an option of the same  series as the option previously purchased. Such a transaction may be  referred to as an offset transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Purchase price. The total actual cost paid or to be paid,  directly or indirectly, by a person to acquire a commodity option. This  price includes all commissions and other fees, in addition to the option  premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Grantor, writer, seller. An individual who sells an option.  Such a person is said to have a short position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Purchaser. An individual who buys an option. Such a person is  said to have a long position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Prior to the entry of the first commodity option transaction for  the account of an option customer, a futures commission merchant or an  introducing broker, or the person soliciting or accepting the order  therefor, must provide an option customer with all of the information  required under the disclosure statement, including the commissions,  costs, fees and other charges to be incurred in connection with the  commodity option transaction and all costs to be incurred by the option  customer if the commodity option is exercised: Provided, That the  futures commission merchant or the introducing broker, or the person  soliciting or accepting the order therefor, must provide current  information to an option customer if information provided previously has  become inaccurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior to the entry into a commodity option transaction on or  subject to the rules of a contract market, each option customer or  prospective option customer shall, to the extent the following amounts  are known or can reasonably be approximated, be informed by the person  soliciting or accepting the order therefor of the amount of the strike  price and the premium (and any mark-ups thereon, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A futures commission merchant and an introducing broker must  establish the necessary procedures and supervision to ensure compliance  with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> This section does not relieve a futures commission merchant or  an introducing broker from any obligation under the Act or the  regulations thereunder, including the obligation to disclose all  material information to existing or prospective option customers even if  the information is not specifically required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of this section, neither a futures commission  merchant nor an introducing broker shall be deemed to be an option  customer.
