                            <p class="depth0">Participating flocks, and the eggs and baby poultry produced from them, that have met the respective requirements specified in this section may be designated by the following terms and

the corresponding designs illustrated in Sec. 145.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean. A flock in which freedom from pullorum and typhoid has been demonstrated to the Official State Agency under the criteria in one of the following paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section (See Sec. 145.14 relating to the official blood test where applicable.):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It has been officially blood tested within the past 12 months with no reactors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is a multiplier breeding flock, or a breeding flock composed of progeny of a primary breeding flock which is intended solely for the production of multiplier breeding flocks, and meets the following specifications as determined by the Official State Agency and the Service:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The flock is located in a State where all persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency within 48 hours the source of all poultry specimens from which S. pullorum or S. gallinarum is isolated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The flock is composed entirely of birds that originated from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean breeding flocks or from flocks that met equivalent requirements under official supervision; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The flock is located on a premises where a flock not classified as U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean was located the previous year; Provided, that an Authorized Testing Agent must blood test up to 300 birds per flock, as described in Sec. 145.14, if the Official State Agency determines that the flock has been exposed to pullorum-typhoid. In making determinations of exposure and setting the number of birds to be blood tested, the Official State Agency shall evaluate the results of any blood tests, described in Sec. 145.14(a)(1), that were performed on an unclassified flock located on the premises during the previous year; the origins of the unclassified flock; and the probability of contacts between the flock for which qualification is being sought and infected wild birds, contaminated feed or waste, or birds, equipment, supplies, or personnel from flocks infected with pullorum-typhoid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is a multiplier breeding flock that originated from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean breeding flocks or from flocks that met equivalent requirements under official supervision, and is located in a State in which it has been determined by the Service that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All hatcheries within the State are qualified as ``National Plan Hatcheries'' or have met equivalent requirements for pullorum-typhoid control under official supervision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All hatchery supply flocks within the State are qualified as U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean or have met equivalent requirements for pullorum-typhoid control under official supervision: Provided, That if other domesticated fowl are maintained on the same premises as the participating flock, freedom from pullorum-typhoid infection shall be demonstrated by an official blood test of each of these fowl;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All shipments of products other than U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean, or equivalent, into the State are prohibited;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency within 48 hours the source of all poultry specimens from which S. pullorum or S. gallinarum is isolated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All reports of any disease outbreak involving a disease covered under the Plan are promptly followed by an investigation by the Official State Agency to determine the origin of the infection; Provided, That if the origin of the infection involves another State, or if there is exposure to poultry in another State from the infected flock, then the National Poultry Improvement Plan will conduct an investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All flocks found to be infected with pullorum or typhoid are quarantined until marketed or destroyed under the supervision of the Official State Agency, or until subsequently blood tested, following the procedure for reacting flocks as contained in Sec. 145.14(a)(5), and all birds fail to demonstrate pullorum or typhoid infection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All poultry, including exhibition, exotic, and game birds, but excluding waterfowl, going to public exhibition shall come from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean or equivalent flocks, or have had a negative pullorum-typhoid test within 90 days of going to public exhibition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Discontinuation of any of the conditions or procedures described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section, or the occurrence of repeated outbreaks of pullorum or typhoid in poultry breeding flocks within or originating within the State shall be grounds for the Service to revoke its determination that such conditions and procedures have been met or complied with. Such action shall not be taken until a thorough investigation has been made by the Service and the Official State Agency has been given an opportunity to present its views.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is a multiplier breeding flock located in a State which has been determined by the Service to be in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and in which pullorum disease or fowl typhoid is not known to exist nor to have existed in hatchery supply flocks within the State during the preceding 24 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is a primary breeding flock located in a State determined to be in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and in which a sample of 300 birds from flocks of more than 300, and each bird in flocks of 300 or less, has been officially tested for pullorum-typhoid within the past 12 months with no reactors: Provided, That when a flock is a primary breeding flock located in a State which has been deemed to be a U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State for the past 3 years, and during which time no isolation of pullorum or typhoid has been made that can be traced to a source in that State, a bacteriological examination monitoring program or a serological examination monitoring program acceptable to the Official State Agency and approved by the Service may be used in lieu of annual blood testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean. This program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatchery industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza in meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks through routine surveillance of each participating breeding flock. A flock, and the hatching eggs and baby poultry produced from it, will qualify for this classification when the Official State Agency determines that it has met one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is a primary breeding flock in which a minimum of 30 birds have been tested negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza as provided in Sec. 145.14(d) when more than 4 months of age. To retain this classification:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sample of at least 30 birds must be tested and found to be negative at intervals of 90 days; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A sample of fewer than 30 birds may be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens are equally represented and a total of 30 birds are tested within each 90-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is a multiplier breeding flock in which a minimum of 30 birds have been tested negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza as provided in Sec. 145.14(d) when more than 4 months of age. To retain this classification:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sample of at least 30 birds must be tested negative at intervals of 180 days; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A sample of fewer than 30 birds may be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens are equally represented and a total of 30 birds are tested within each 180-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A sample of at least 30 birds must be tested and found negative to H5/H7 avian influenza within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> U.S. Salmonella Monitored. This program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatching industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of salmonellosis. It is intended to reduce the incidence of Salmonella organisms in hatching eggs and day-old waterfowl through an effective and practical sanitation program at the breeder farm and in the

hatchery. This will afford other segments of the poultry industry an opportunity to reduce the incidence of Salmonella in their products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A flock and the hatching eggs and day-old waterfowl produced from it must meet the following requirements, as determined by the Official State Agency, to be eligible for this classification:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The flock is maintained in compliance with isolation, sanitation, and management procedures for Salmonella in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If feed contains animal protein, the protein products must have been heated throughout to a minimum temperature of 190 [deg]F or above, or to a minimum temperature of 165 [deg]F for at least 20 minutes, or to a minimum temperature of 184 [deg]F under 70 lbs. pressure during the manufacturing process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Feed shall be stored and transported in a manner that prevents contamination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Waterfowl shall be hatched in a hatchery whose sanitation is maintained in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter and sanitized or fumigated in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An Authorized Agent shall take environmental samples from the hatchery every 30 days, i.e., meconium or box liner paper. An authorized laboratory for Salmonella shall examine the samples bacteriologically.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An Authorized Agent shall take environmental samples in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter from each flock at 4 months of age and every 30 days thereafter. An authorized laboratory for Salmonella shall examine the environmental samples bacteriologically.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Flocks may be vaccinated with a paratyphoid vaccine: Provided, that a sample of at least 100 birds will be segregated and shall remain unvaccinated until the flock reaches at least 4 months of age.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Official State Agency may monitor the effectiveness of the egg sanitation practices in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To claim products are of this classification, all products shall be derived from a hatchery and flock that meet the requirements of the classification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This classification may be revoked by the Official State Agency if the participant fails to follow recommended corrective measures.
