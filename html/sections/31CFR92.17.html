Although the assessing official should accord appropriate weight to the findings and recommendations of the examining official, the assessing official is not bound by them. The assessing official may approve, disapprove, modify, or substitute any or all of the examining official's findings and recommendations if, in his or her judgment, the evidence in the record supports such a decision. The assessing official will determine whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The facts and violations found justify the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the assessing official determines that no violation has occurred, the official shall promptly send a letter indicating that determination to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the assessing official determines that a violation has occurred:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assessing official shall issue a Final Notice of Assessment to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assessing official may, in his or her discretion:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Impose a civil penalty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not impose a civil penalty; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Impose a civil penalty and suspend the payment of all or some of the civil penalty, conditioned on the violator's future compliance with 31 U.S.C. 333.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a civil penalty is imposed under Sec. 92.17(c)(2)(i) or (iii), the assessing official shall determine the appropriate amount of the penalty in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 333(c)(2).
