                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each locomotive shall be inspected at each periodic inspection to determine whether it complies with this part. Except as provided in Sec. 229.9, all non-complying conditions shall be repaired before the locomotive is used. Except as provided in Sec. 229.33 and paragraph (b) of this section, the interval between any two periodic inspections may not exceed 92 days. Periodic inspections shall only be made where adequate facilities are available. At each periodic inspection, a locomotive shall be positioned so that a person may safely inspect the entire underneath portion of the locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each locomotive equipped with advanced microprocessor-based on-board electronic condition monitoring controls:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The interval between periodic inspections shall not exceed 184 days; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least once each 33 days, the daily inspection required by Sec. 229.21, shall be performed by a qualified mechanical inspector as defined by Sec. 229.5. A record of the inspection that contains the name of the person performing the inspection and the date that it was performed shall be maintained in the locomotive cab until the next periodic inspection is performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each new locomotive shall receive an initial periodic inspection before it is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the initial periodic inspection, the date and place of the last tests performed that are the equivalent of the tests required by Secs. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31 shall be entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A. These dates shall determine when the tests first become due under Secs. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31. Out of use credit may be carried over from Form FRA F 6180-49 and entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each periodic inspection shall be recorded on Form FRA F 6180-49A. The form shall be signed by the person conducting the inspection and certified by that person's supervisor that the work was done. The form shall be displayed under a transparent cover in a conspicuous place in the cab of each locomotive. A railroad maintaining and transferring records as provided for in Sec. 229.20 shall print the name of the person who performed the inspections, repairs, or certified work on the Form FRA F 6180-49A that is displayed in the cab of each locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> At the first periodic inspection in each calendar year, the carrier shall remove from each locomotive Form FRA F 6180-49A covering the previous calendar year. If a locomotive does not receive its first periodic inspection in a calendar year before April 2, or July 3 if it's a locomotive equipped with advanced microprocessor-based on-board electronic condition monitoring controls, because it is out of use, the form shall be promptly replaced. The Form FRA F 6180-49A covering the preceding year for each locomotive, in or out of use, shall be signed by the railroad official responsible for the locomotive and filed as required in Sec. 229.23(f). The date and place of the last periodic inspection and the date and place of the last tests performed under Secs. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31 shall be transferred to the replacement Form FRA F 6180-49A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The railroad mechanical officer who is in charge of a locomotive shall maintain in his office a secondary record of the information reported on Form FRA F 6180-49A. The secondary record shall be retained until Form FRA F 6180-49A has been removed from the locomotive and filed in the railroad office of the mechanical officer in charge of the locomotive. If the Form FRA F 6180-49A removed from the locomotive is not clearly legible, the secondary record shall be retained until the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the succeeding year is filed. The Form F 6180-49A removed from a locomotive shall be retained until the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the succeeding year is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The railroad shall maintain, and provide employees performing inspections under this section with, a list of the defects and repairs made on each locomotive since the date that the last

inspection required by this section was performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The railroad shall provide employees performing inspections under this section with a document containing all tests conducted since the last periodic inspection, and procedures needed to perform the inspection.
