                            <p class="depth0">[Statutory Provisions]</p><p class="depth0">All welding, cutting, or soldering with arc or flame in all underground areas of a coal mine shall, whenever practicable, be conducted in fireproof

enclosures. Welding, cutting, or soldering with arc or flame in other than a fireproof enclosure shall be done under the supervision of a qualified person who shall make a diligent search for fire during and after such operations and shall, immediately before and during such operations, continuously test for methane with means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane. Welding, cutting, or soldering shall not be conducted in air that contains 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane. Rock dust or suitable fire extinguishers shall be immediately available during such welding, cutting or soldering.


Sec. 75.1106-1  Test for methane.</p><p class="depth0">Until December 31, 1970, a permissible flame safety lamp may be used to make tests for methane required by the regulations in this part. On and after December 31, 1970 a methane detector approved by the Secretary shall be used for such tests and a permissible flame safety lamp may be used as a supplemental testing device. A person qualified to test for methane under Sec. 75.151 will be a qualified person for the purpose of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation, Handling and Storage of Liquefied and Nonliquefied</p><p class="depth0">Compressed Gas Cylinders
