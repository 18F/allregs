A billing carrier is afforded discretion to set standards for  determining when a subscriber's complaint warrants forgiveness, refund  or credit of interstate pay-per-call or information services charges  provided that such charges must be forgiven, refunded, or credited when  a subscriber has complained about such charges and either this  Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or a court of competent  jurisdiction has found or the carrier has determined, upon  investigation, that the service has been offered in violation of federal  law or the regulations that are either set forth in this subpart or  prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to titles II or III  of the TDDRA. Carriers shall observe the record retention requirements  set forth in Sec. 42.6 of this chapter except that relevant records  shall be retained by carriers beyond the requirements of part 42 of this  chapter when a complaint is pending at the time the specified retention  period expires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any carrier assigning a telephone number to a provider of  interstate pay-per-call services but not providing billing and  collection services for such services, shall, by tariff or contract,  require that the provider and/or its billing and collection agents have  in place procedures whereby, upon complaint, pay-per-call charges may be  forgiven, refunded, or credited, provided that such charges must be  forgiven, refunded, or credited when a subscriber has complained about  such charges and either this Commission, the Federal Trade Commission,  or a court of competent jurisdiction has found or the carrier has  determined, upon investigation, that the service has been offered in  violation of federal law or the regulations that are either set forth in  this subpart or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to  titles II or III of the TDDRA.
