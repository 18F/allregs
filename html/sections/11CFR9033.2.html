(1) The candidate shall certify that he or she  is seeking nomination by a political party to the Office of President in  more than one State. For purposes of this section, in order for a  candidate to be deemed to be seeking nomination by a political party to  the office of President, the party whose nomination the candidate seeks  must have a procedure for holding a primary election, as defined in 11  CFR 9032.7, for nomination to that office. For purposes of this section,  the term political party means an association, committee or organization  which nominates an individual for election to the office of President.  The fact that an association, committee or organization qualifies as a  political party under this section does not affect the party's status as  a national political party for purposes of 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)</em> and  30116(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall  certify that they have not incurred and will not incur expenditures in  connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination, which  expenditures are in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall  certify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That they have received matchable contributions totaling more  than $5,000 in each of at least 20 States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the matchable contributions are from individuals who are  residents of the State for which their contributions are submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A maximum of $250 of each individual's aggregate contributions  will be considered as matchable contributions for the purpose of meeting  the thresholds of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of this section, contributions of an individual  who maintains residences in more than one State may only be counted  toward the $5,000 threshold for the State from which the earliest  contribution was made by that contributor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Threshold submission. To become eligible to receive matching  payments, the candidate shall submit documentation of the contributions  described in 11 CFR 9033.2(b)(3) to the Commission for review.
