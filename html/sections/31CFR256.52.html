                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to 31 CFR part 208, Judgment Fund payments are to be made  by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Fiscal Service will issue an  electronic payment to the payee's account as specified on the  appropriate Judgment Fund form. If a submitting agency determines that a  waiver (in accordance   with 31 CFR part 208) to the requirement for payment by EFT is  appropriate, Fiscal Service will issue a payment by check. The Voucher  for Payment must direct payment to the payee designated in the judgment  or settlement agreement.</p>
