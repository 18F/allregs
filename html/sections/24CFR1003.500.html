A public agency so designated shall be subject to the same requirements as are applicable to subrecipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grantee is responsible for ensuring that ICDBG funds are used in accordance with all program requirements. The use of designated public agencies, subrecipients, or contractors does not relieve the grantee of this responsibility. The grantee is also responsible for determining the adequacy of performance under subrecipient agreements and procurement contracts, and for taking appropriate action when performance problems arise, such as the actions described in Sec. 1003.701.</p>
