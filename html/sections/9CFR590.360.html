                            <p class="depth0">Immediately after an appeal inspection is completed, an appeal  certificate shall be issued to show that the original inspection was  sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate shall supersede any  previously issued certificate   for the product involved and shall clearly identify the number and date  of the superseded certificate. The issuance of the appeal certificate  may be withheld until any previously issued certificate and all copies  have been returned when such action is deemed necessary to protect the  interest of the Government. When the appeal inspector assigns a  different class to the lot or determines that a net weight shortage  exists, the lot shall be retained pending correction of the labeling or  approval of the product disposition by the National Supervisor.
