Final versions of the statements required by paragraph (b) of Sec. 750.2 shall be published in the Federal Register together with the final rule. The Agency shall also publish at that time:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of all material added to the record (other than public comments and material from the hearing record) which has not previously been listed in a Federal Register document, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 750</p><p class="depth2">To assist in reading the regulations set forth above, this appendix sets forth the principal stages through which rules promulgated under section 6 of TSCA will pass.</p><p class="depth2">The second column gives the relationship that one date bears to another whenever that relationship is specified in the regulations, and cites the governing provision. The third column contains estimates of the time that a typical rulemaking is likely to require to reach and complete each stage of these proceedings. In drawing up this third column, we have assumed that 60 days will be allowed for the submission of main comments; that the legislative phase of the informal hearing will take two weeks, and that cross-examination will take four days. Since these are only estimates, in any given rulemaking shorter or longer times may actually be required for each of these stages.
