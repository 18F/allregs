The vertical scanning frequency is 2/525 times the horizontal scanning frequency; this corresponds nominally to 60 Hz (the actual value is 59.94 Hz). For monochrome transmissions only, the nominal values of line and field frequencies may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The aspect ratio of the transmitted television picture shall be 4 units horizontally to 3 units vertically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> During active scanning intervals, the scene shall be scanned from left to right horizontally and from top to bottom vertically, at uniform velocities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A carrier shall be modulated within a single television channel for both picture and synchronizing signals.

A television broadcast station that installs, utilizes, and maintains in a commercially reasonable manner the equipment and associated software to comply with ATSC A/85 RP shall be deemed in compliance with respect to locally inserted commercials, which for the purposes of this provision are commercial advertisements added to a programming stream by a station prior to or at the time of transmission to viewers. In order to be considered to have installed, utilized and maintained the equipment and associated software in a commercially reasonable manner, a television broadcast station must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Install, maintain and utilize equipment to properly measure the loudness of the content and to ensure that the dialnorm metadata value correctly matches the loudness of the content when encoding the audio into AC-3 for transmitting the content to the consumer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide records showing the consistent and ongoing use of this equipment in the regular course of business and demonstrating that the equipment has undergone commercially reasonable periodic maintenance and testing to ensure its continued proper operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certify that it either has no actual knowledge of a violation of the ATSC A/85 RP, or that any violation of which it has become aware has been corrected promptly upon becoming aware of such a violation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certify that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Embedded commercials--safe harbor. With respect to embedded commercials, which, for the purposes of this provision, are those commercial advertisements placed into the programming stream by a third party (i.e., programmer) and passed through by the station to viewers, a television broadcast station must certify that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints, and may demonstrate compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP through one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Relying on a network's or other programmer's certification of compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP with respect to commercial programming, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The certification is widely available by Web site or other means to any television broadcast station, cable operator, or multichannel video programming distributor that transmits that programming; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The television broadcast station has no reason to believe that the certification is false; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The television broadcast station performs a spot check, as defined in Sec.  73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on

The television broadcast station must not inform the network or programmer of the spot check prior to performing it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Spot-checking must be conducted after the signal has passed through the television broadcast station's processing equipment (e.g., at the output of a television receiver). If a problem is found, the television broadcast station must determine the source of the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To be considered valid, the television broadcast station must demonstrate appropriate maintenance records for the audio loudness meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> With reference to the annual ``safe harbor'' spot check in Sec.  73.682(e)(3)(ii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To be considered valid, the television broadcast station must demonstrate, at the time of any enforcement inquiry, that appropriate spot checks had been ongoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If there is no single 24 hour period in which all programmers of a given program stream are represented, an annual spot check may consist of a series of loudness measurements over the course of a 7 day period, totaling no fewer than 24 hours, that measure at least one program, in its entirety, provided by each non-certified programmer that supplies programming for that program stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If annual spot checks are performed for two consecutive years without finding evidence of noncompliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, no further annual spot checks are required to remain in the safe harbor for existing programming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-certified program streams must be spot-checked annually using the approach described in this section. If annual spot checks of the program stream are performed for two consecutive years without finding evidence of noncompliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, no further annual spot checks are required to remain in the safe harbor for that program stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Even after the two year period for annual spot checks, if a spot check shows noncompliance on a non-certified program stream, the station must once again perform annual spot checks of that program stream to be in the safe harbor for that programming. If these renewed annual spot checks are performed for two consecutive years without finding additional evidence of noncompliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, no further annual spot checks are required to remain in the safe harbor for that program stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> With reference to the spot checks in response to an enforcement inquiry pursuant to Sec.  73.682(e)(3)(i)(C), (2), or (3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If notified of a pattern or trend of complaints, the television broadcast station must perform the 24-hour spot check of the program stream at issue within 30 days or as otherwise specified by the Enforcement Bureau; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the spot check reveals actual compliance, the television broadcast station must notify the Commission in its response to the enforcement inquiry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If any spot check shows noncompliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, the television station must notify the Commission and the network or programmer within 7 days, direct the programmer's attention to any relevant complaints, and must perform a follow-up spot check within 30 days of providing such notice. The station must notify the Commission and the network or programmer of the results of the follow-up spot check. Notice to the Federal Communications Commission must be provided to the Chief, Investigations and Hearings Division, Enforcement Bureau, or as otherwise directed in a Letter of Inquiry to which the station is responding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the follow-up spot check shows compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, the station remains in the safe harbor for that program stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the follow-up spot check shows noncompliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, the station will not be in the safe harbor with respect to commercials contained in the program stream for which the spot check showed noncompliance until a subsequent spot check shows that the program stream is in compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of a real-time processor. A television broadcast station that installs, maintains and utilizes a real-time processor in a commercially reasonable manner will be deemed in compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP with regard to any commercial advertisements on which it uses such a processor, so long as it also:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provides records showing the consistent and ongoing use of this equipment in the regular course of business and demonstrating that the equipment has undergone commercially reasonable periodic maintenance and testing to ensure its continued proper operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certifies that it either has no actual knowledge of a violation of the ATSC A/85 RP, or that any violation of which it has become aware has been corrected promptly upon becoming aware of such a violation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certifies that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercials locally inserted by a station's agent--safe harbor. With respect to commercials locally inserted, which for the purposes of this provision are commercial advertisements added to a programming stream for the television broadcast station by a third party after it has been received from the programmer but prior to or at the time of transmission to viewers, a station may demonstrate compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP by relying on the third party local inserter's certification of compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The television broadcast station has no reason to believe that the certification is false;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The television broadcast station certifies that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The television broadcast station performs a spot check, as defined in Sec.  73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on the programming at issue in response to an enforcement inquiry concerning a pattern or trend of complaints regarding commercials inserted by that third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Instead of demonstrating compliance pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section, a station may demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section in response to an enforcement inquiry prompted by a pattern or trend of complaints by demonstrating actual compliance with ATSC A/85 RP with regard to the commercial advertisements that are the subject of the inquiry, and certifying that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any such pattern or trend of complaints.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec.  73.682: For additional information regarding this requirement, see Implementation of the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, FCC 11-182.
