When the color of kernels in a lot generally conforms to the ``light'' or ``light amber'' classification, that color classification may be used to describe the lot in connection with the grade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Light'' means that the kernel is mostly golden color or lighter, with not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than golden, and none of the surface darker than light brown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Light amber'' means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of its surface light brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than light brown, and none of the surface darker than medium brown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Amber'' means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of the surface medium brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than medium brown, and none of the surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Dark amber'' means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of the surface dark brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. Department of Agriculture kernel color standards, PEC-MC-1, consisting of plastic models of pecan kernels, illustrate the color intensities implied by the terms ``golden,'' ``light brown,'' ``medium brown,'' and ``dark brown'' referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. These color standards may be examined in the Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, South Building, Washington, D.C. 20250; in any field office of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service; or upon request of any authorized inspector of such Service.
