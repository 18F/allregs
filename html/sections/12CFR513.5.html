An application for reinstatement on any other grounds by any person suspended under paragraph (b) of Sec. 513.4 may be filed at any time. Such application shall state with particularity the relief desired and the grounds therefor and shall include supporting evidence, when available. The applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for an informal hearing in the matter, unless the applicant has waived a hearing in the application and, instead, has elected to have the matter determined on the basis of written submissions. Such hearing shall utilize the procedures established in Sec. 508.3 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 508.7 of this chapter. However, such suspension shall continue unless and until the applicant has been reinstated by order of the Office for good cause shown.
