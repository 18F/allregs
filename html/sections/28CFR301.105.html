                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After initiating necessary action for medical attention, the  work detail supervisor shall immediately secure a record of the cause,  nature, and exact extent of the injury. The work detail supervisor shall  complete a BP-140, Injury Report (Inmate), on all injuries reported by  the inmate, as well as injuries observed by staff. In the case of  injuries on work details for other federal entities, the work supervisor  shall also immediately inform community corrections or institution  staff, as appropriate, of the injury. The injury report shall contain a  signed statement from the inmate on how the accident occurred. The names  and statements of all witnesses (e.g., staff, inmates, or others) shall  be included in the report. If the injury resulted from the operation of  mechanical equipment, an identifying description or photograph of the  machine or instrument causing the injury shall be obtained, to include a  description of all safety equipment used by the injured inmate at the  time of the injury. Staff shall provide the inmate with a copy of the  injury report. Staff shall then forward the original   and remaining copies of the injury report to the Institutional Safety  Manager for review. In the case of inmates based at community  corrections centers, the work detail supervisor shall provide the inmate  with a copy of the injury report and shall forward the original and  remaining copies of the injury report to the Community Corrections  Manager responsible for the particular community corrections center  where the inmate is housed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Institution Safety Manager or Community Corrections Manager  shall ensure that a medical description of the injury is included on the  BP-140 whenever the injury requires medical attention. The Institution  Safety Manager or Community Corrections Manager shall also ensure that  the appropriate sections of BP-140, Page 2, Injury--Lost-Time Follow-Up  Report, are completed and that all reported work injuries are properly  documented.
