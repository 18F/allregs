                            <p class="depth0">Sections 1066.831 and 1066.835 describe the detailed procedures for  the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP). This testing applies for  all vehicles subject to the SFTP standards in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S.  The SFTP test procedure consists of FTP testing and two additional test  elements--a sequence of vehicle operation with more aggressive driving  and a sequence of vehicle operation that accounts for the impact of the  vehicle's air conditioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The SFTP standard applies as a composite representing the three  test elements. The emission results from the aggressive driving test  element (Sec.  1066.831), the air conditioning test element (Sec.   1066.835), and the FTP test element (Sec.  1066.820) are analyzed  according to the calculation methodology and compared to the applicable  SFTP emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test elements of the SFTP may be run in any sequence that  includes the specified preconditioning steps.</p>
