                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application filing process. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This subpart  provides guidance to employers desiring to apply for a labor  certification for the employment of H-2A workers to perform agricultural  employment of a temporary or seasonal nature. The regulations in this  subpart provide that such employers must file with the Administrator,  OFLC an H-2A application on forms prescribed by the ETA that describe  the material terms and conditions of employment to be offered and  afforded to U.S. and H-2A workers. The application must be filed with  the Administrator, OFLC at least 45 calendar days   before the first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A  workers. The application must contain attestations of the employer's  compliance or promise to comply with program requirements regarding  recruitment of eligible U.S. workers, the payment of an appropriate  wage, and terms and conditions of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 75 and no fewer than 60 calendar days before the  first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, and  as a precursor to the filing of an Application for Temporary Employment  Certification, the employer must initiate positive recruitment of  eligible U.S. workers and cooperate with the local office of the State  Workforce Agency (SWA) which serves the area of intended employment to  place a job order into intrastate and interstate recruitment. Prior to  commencing recruitment an employer must obtain the appropriate wage for  the position directly from the ETA National Processing Center (NPC). The  employer must then place a job order with the SWA; place print  advertisements meeting the requirements of this regulation; contact  former U.S. employees; and, when so designated by the Secretary, recruit  in other States of traditional or expected labor supply with a  significant number of U.S. workers who, if recruited, would be willing  to make themselves available at the time and place needed. The SWA will  post the job order locally, as well as in all States listed in the  application as anticipated work sites, and in any additional States  designated by the Secretary as States of traditional or expected labor  supply. The SWA will keep the job order open until the end of the  designated recruitment period. No more than 50 days prior to the first  date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, the  employer will prepare and sign an initial written recruitment report  that it must submit with its Application for Temporary Employment  Certification (www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov). The recruitment report  must contain information regarding the original number of openings for  which the employer recruited. The employer's obligation to engage in  positive recruitment will end on the actual date on which the H-2A  workers depart for the place of work, or 3 days prior to the first date  the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, whichever occurs  first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be  filed by mail unless the Department publishes a Notice in the Federal  Register requiring that applications be filed electronically.  Applications that meet threshold requirements for completeness and  accuracy will be processed by NPC staff, who will review each  application for compliance with the criteria for certification. Each  application must meet requirements for timeliness and temporary need and  must provide assurances and other safeguards against adverse impact on  the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. Employers receiving a  labor certification must continue to cooperate with the SWA by accepting  referrals--and have the obligation to hire qualified and eligible U.S.  workers who apply--until the end of the designated recruitment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deficient applications. The CO will promptly review the  application and notify the applicant in writing if there are  deficiencies that render the application not acceptable for  certification, and afford the applicant a 5 calendar day period (from  date of the employer's receipt) to resubmit a modified application or to  file an appeal of the CO's decision not to approve the application as  acceptable for consideration. Modified applications that fail to cure  deficiencies will be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amendment of applications. This subpart provides for the  amendment of applications. Where the recruitment is not materially  affected by such amendments, additional positive recruitment will not be  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determinations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determinations. If the employer has complied  with the criteria for certification, including recruitment of eligible  U.S. workers, the CO must make a determination on the application by 30  days before the first date the employer requires the services of the H- 2A workers. An employer's failure to comply with any of the  certification criteria or to cure deficiencies identified by the CO may   lengthen the time required for processing, resulting in a final  determination less than 30 days prior to the stated date of need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certified applications. This subpart provides that an  application for temporary agricultural labor certification will be  certified if the CO finds that the employer has not offered and does not  intend to offer foreign workers higher wages, better working conditions,  or fewer restrictions than those offered and afforded to U.S. workers;  that sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and  eligible will not be available at the time and place needed to perform  the work for which H-2A workers are being requested; and that the  employment of such nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the wages and  working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Amount. This subpart provides that each employer  (except joint employer associations) of H-2A workers will pay the  appropriate fees to the Department for each temporary agricultural labor  certification received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Timeliness of payment. The fee must be received by the CO no  later than 30 calendar days after the granting of each temporary  agricultural labor certification. Fees received any later are untimely.  A persistent or prolonged failure to pay fees in a timely manner is a  substantial program violation which may result in the denial of future  temporary agricultural labor certifications and/or program debarment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Denied applications. This subpart provides that if the  application for temporary agricultural labor certification is denied, in  whole or in part, the employer may seek expedited review of the denial,  or a de novo hearing, by an administrative law judge as provided in this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transition of filing procedures from current regulations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Compliance with these regulations. Employers with a date of need for H- 2A workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural services on or after  January 1, 2010 must comply with all of the obligations and assurances  required in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transition from former regulations. Employers with a date of  need for H-2A workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural services  prior to January 1, 2010 will file applications in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtaining required wage rate. An employer will not obtain an  offered wage rate through the NPC prior to filing an application, but  will complete and submit Form ETA-9142, Application for Temporary  Employment Certification no less than 45 days prior to their date of  need. The employer will simultaneously submit Form ETA-790 Agricultural  and Food Processing Clearance Order, along with the Application for  Temporary Employment Certification, directly to the NPC having  jurisdiction over H-2A applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-filing activities. Activities required to be conducted  prior to filing under the final rule will be conducted post-filing  during this transition period. The employer will be expected to make  attestations in its application applicable to its future activities  concerning recruitment, payment of the offered wage rate, etc. Employers  will not be required to complete an initial recruitment report for  submission with the application, but will be required to complete a  recruitment report for submission to the NPC prior to certification, and  will also be required to complete a final recruitment report covering  the entire recruitment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Acceptance of application. Upon receipt, the NPC will provide  the employer with the wage rate to be offered, at a minimum, by the  employer, and will process the application in a manner consistent with  new Sec. 655.107, issuing a notification of deficiencies for any  curable deficiencies within 7 calendar days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Processing of application. Once the application and job order  have been accepted, the NPC will transmit a copy of the job order to the  SWA(s) serving the area of intended employment to initiate intrastate  and interstate clearance, request that the SWA(s) schedule an inspection  of the housing, and provide instructions to the employer to commence  positive recruitment in a manner consistent with Sec. 655.102(d)(2)  through (4). The NPC will designate labor supply States during this  period on a case-by-case basis. Such designations must be based on  information   provided by State agencies or by other sources, and will to the extent  information is available take into account the success of recent efforts  by out-of-State employers to recruit in that State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions of terms used in this subpart. For the purposes of  this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) means a person within the DOL's  Office of Administrative Law Judges appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105,  or a panel of such persons designated by the Chief Administrative Law  Judge from the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA)  established by part 656 of this chapter, which will hear and decide  appeals as set forth in Sec. 655.115.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator, OFLC means the primary official of the Office of  Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), or the Administrator, OFLC 's  designee.</p><p class="depth0">Adverse effect wage rate (AEWR) means the minimum wage rate that the  Administrator, OFLC has determined must be offered and paid to every H- 2A worker employed under the DOL-approved Application for Temporary  Employment Certification in a particular occupation and/or area, as well  as to U.S. workers hired by employers into corresponding employment  during the H-2A recruitment period, to ensure that the wages of  similarly employed U.S. workers will not be adversely affected.</p><p class="depth0">Agent means a legal entity or person, such as an association of  agricultural employers, or an attorney for an association, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is authorized to act on behalf of the employer for temporary  agricultural labor certification purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not itself an employer, or a joint employer, as defined in  this paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a specific  application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is not under suspension, debarment, expulsion, or disbarment  from practice before any court or the Department, the Board of  Immigration Appeals, the immigration judges, or the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) under 8 CFR 292.3 or 1003.101.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural association means any nonprofit or cooperative  association of farmers, growers, or ranchers (including but not limited  to processing establishments, canneries, gins, packing sheds, nurseries,  or other fixed-site agricultural employers), incorporated or qualified  under applicable State law, that recruits, solicits, hires, employs,  furnishes, houses or transports any worker that is subject to sec. 218  of the INA.

When considering whether an employer is a  successor for purposes of Sec. 655.118, the primary consideration will  be the personal involvement of the firm's ownership, management,  supervisors, and others associated with the firm in the violations  resulting in a debarment recommendation. Normally, wholly new management  or ownership of the same business operation, one in which the former  management or owner does not retain a direct or indirect interest, will  not be deemed to be a successor in interest for purposes of debarment. A  determination of whether or not a successor in interest exists is based  on the entire circumstances viewed in their totality. The factors to be  considered include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substantial continuity of the same business operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of the same facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continuity of the work force;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Similarity of jobs and working conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Similarity of supervisory personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Similarity in machinery, equipment, and production methods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Similarity of products and services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The ability of the predecessor to provide relief.</p><p class="depth0">Temporary agricultural labor certification means the certification  made by the Secretary with respect to an employer seeking to file with  DHS a visa petition to employ one or more foreign nationals as an H-2A  worker, pursuant to secs. 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 214(a) and (c), and 218  of the INA that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and  qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to  perform the agricultural labor or services involved in the petition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employment of the foreign worker in such agricultural labor  or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions  of workers in the U.S. similarly employed (8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 1184(a) and (c), and 1188).</p><p class="depth0">United States (U.S.), when used in a geographic sense, means the  continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, and the territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, and, as of the  transition program effective date, as defined in the Consolidated  Natural Resources Act of 2008, Public Law 110-229, Title VII, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth0">United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) means the  Federal agency making the determination under the INA whether to grant  petitions filed by employers seeking H-2A workers to perform temporary  agricultural work in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0">United States worker (U.S. worker) means a worker who is</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A citizen or national of the U.S., or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the  U.S., is admitted as a refugee under sec. 207 of the INA, is granted  asylum under sec.   208 of the INA, or is an immigrant otherwise authorized (by the INA or  by DHS) to be employed in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Wages means all forms of cash remuneration to a worker by an  employer in payment for personal services.</p><p class="depth0">Within [number and type] days means, for purposes of determining an  employer's compliance with the timing requirements for appeals and  requests for review, a period that begins to run on the first business  day after the Department sends a notice to the employer by means  normally assuring next-day delivery, and will end on the day that the  employer sends whatever communication is required by these rules back to  the Department, as evidenced by a postal mark or other similar receipt.</p><p class="depth0">Work contract means all the material terms and conditions of  employment relating to wages, hours, working conditions, and other  benefits, required by the applicable regulations in Subpart B of 20 CFR  part 655, Labor Certification for Temporary Agricultural Employment of  H-2A Aliens in the U.S. (H-2A Workers), or these regulations, including  those terms and conditions attested to by the H-2A employer, which  contract between the employer and the worker may be in the form of a  separate written document.
