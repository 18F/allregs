                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employees are encouraged to engage in outside writing and  editing whether or not done for compensation, when such activity is not  otherwise prohibited. Such writing and editing, though not a part of  official duties, may be on a directly related subject or entirely  unrelated. Certain conditions must be met in either case, however, and  certain clearances or approvals are prescribed according to the content  of the material as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions applying to writing and editing done not as a part of  official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following conditions shall apply to all writing and editing  whether related or unrelated to the employee's official duties:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Government-financed time or supplies shall not be used by the  author or by other Government employees in connection with the activity;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Official support must not be expressed or implied in the  material itself or advertising or promotional material, including book  jackets and covers, relating to the employee and his or her contribution  to the publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the writing or editing activity is unrelated to the  employee's official duties or other responsibilities and programs of the  Federal government, the employee must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make no mention of his or her official title or affiliation with  the Department, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use his or her official title or affiliation with the  Department in a way that will not suggest or convey official endorsement  of the work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the writing or editing activity is related to the employee's  official duties or other responsibilities and programs of the Federal  government, the employee must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make no mention of his or her official title or affiliation with  the Department, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use his or her official title or affiliation with the  Department and a disclaimer as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit the material for clearance within the operating  component, under procedures established by the component. When clearance  is denied at any lower level, the employee shall have recourse for  review up to the head of the principal operating component. This  clearance will show there are no official objections to the activity and  the employee may then use his or her official title or affiliation with  the Department usually without a disclaimer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclaimers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except where the requirement for disclaimer is  waived as a result of official clearance, disclaimers shall be used in  all writing and editing related to the employee's official duties or  other responsibilities and programs of the Federal government:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In which the employee identifies himself or herself by official  title or affiliation with the Department, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the prominence of the employee or the employee's position  might lead the public to associate him or her with the Department, even  without identification other than name.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclaimers shall read as follows unless a different wording is  approved by the Assistant General Counsel, Business and Administrative  Law Division, Office of the General Counsel: ``This (article, book,  etc.) was (written, edited) by (employee's name) in (his or her) private  capacity. No official suport or endorsement by (name of operating  component or of Department) is intended or should be inferred.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advance approval. Advance approval is required in accordance  with Sec. 73.735-708 of this subpart when one or more of the following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Government information is used which is not available on  request to persons outside the Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Material is written or edited which pertains to subject matter  directly related to an employee's official duties; (This includes  editing for scientific or professional journals which is related to his  or her official duties.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Material is written or edited which pertains to any Government- sponsored research or other studies for which clinical case records or  other material of a confidential nature are used or to which access is  limited for persons outside the Government. Such use will not be  permitted unless made under safeguards established by the operating  component to retain the confidentiality of the material, and such use is  determined to be in the public interest.</p>
