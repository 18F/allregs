                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant must analyze the propeller system to assess the  likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to  occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The propeller system in a typical installation. When the  analysis depends on representative components, assumed interfaces, or  assumed installed conditions, the assumptions must be stated in the  analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consequential secondary failures and dormant failures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this  section, or that result in the hazardous propeller effects defined in  paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant must summarize those failures that could result in  major propeller effects or hazardous propeller effects defined in  paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of  occurrence of those effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant must show that hazardous propeller effects are not  predicted to occur at a rate in excess of that defined as extremely  remote (probability of 10-7 or less per propeller   flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures  may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the  total rate for hazardous propeller effects, compliance may be shown by  demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous propeller effect  arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater  than 10-8 per propeller flight hour. In dealing with  probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not  possible and reliance must be placed on engineering judgment and  previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If significant doubt exists as to the effects of failures or  likely combination of failures, the Administrator may require  assumptions used in the analysis to be verified by test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The primary failures of certain single propeller elements (for  example, blades) cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the  failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous propeller  effects, those elements must be identified as propeller critical parts.  For propeller critical parts, applicants must meet the prescribed  integrity specifications of Sec. 35.16. These instances must be stated  in the safety analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If reliance is placed on a safety system to prevent a failure  progressing to hazardous propeller effects, the possibility of a safety  system failure in combination with a basic propeller failure must be  included in the analysis. Such a safety system may include safety  devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and  other similar equipment or procedures. If items of the safety system are  outside the control of the propeller manufacturer, the assumptions of  the safety analysis with respect to the reliability of these parts must  be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the propeller  installation and operation instructions required under Sec. 35.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following  items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately  substantiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This  includes verifying that items that could fail in a latent manner are  functioning properly. When necessary to prevent hazardous propeller  effects, these maintenance actions and intervals must be published in  the instructions for continued airworthiness required under Sec. 35.4.  Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the propeller system could  lead to hazardous propeller effects, the appropriate maintenance  procedures must be included in the relevant propeller manuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verification of the satisfactory functioning of safety or other  devices at pre-flight or other stated periods. The details of this  satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provision of specific instrumentation not otherwise  required. Such instrumentation must be published in the appropriate  documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A fatigue assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If applicable, the safety analysis must include, but not be  limited to, assessment of indicating equipment, manual and automatic  controls, governors and propeller control systems, synchrophasers,  synchronizers, and propeller thrust reversal systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator and stated in the  safety analysis, the following failure definitions apply to compliance  with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following are regarded as hazardous propeller effects:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The development of excessive drag.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A significant thrust in the opposite direction to that  commanded by the pilot.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The release of the propeller or any major portion of the  propeller.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A failure that results in excessive unbalance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following are regarded as major propeller effects for  variable pitch propellers:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An inability to feather the propeller for feathering propellers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An inability to change propeller pitch when commanded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A significant uncommanded change in pitch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A significant uncontrollable torque or speed fluctuation.
