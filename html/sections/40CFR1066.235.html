                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section describes how to verify the accuracy of  the dynamometer speed determination. When performing this verification,  you must also ensure the dynamometer speed at any devices used to  display or record vehicle speed (such as a driver's aid) is  representative of the speed input from the dynamometer speed  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform this verification upon initial  installation, within 370 days before testing, and after major  maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. Use one of the following procedures to verify the  accuracy and resolution of the dynamometer speed simulation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.  Make sure the instrumentation does not affect the signal to the  dynamometer control circuits. Determine the speed error as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set the dynamometer to speed-control mode. Set the dynamometer  speed to a value of approximately 4.5 m/s (10 mph); record the output of  the frequency counter after 10 seconds. Determine the roll speed,  vact, using the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19FE15.023   Where:  f = frequency of the dynamometer speed sensing device, accurate to at</p><p class="depth4">least four significant figures. droll = nominal roll diameter, accurate to the nearest 1.0</p><p class="depth4">mm, consistent with Sec.  1066.225(d). n = the number of pulses per revolution from the dynamometer roll speed</p><p class="depth4">sensor.</p><p class="depth4">Example:  f = 2.9231 Hz = 2.9231 s-\1\ droll = 904.40 mm = 0.90440 m n = 1 pulse/rev [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19FE15.024  vact = 8.3053 m/s</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for the  maximum speed expected during testing and at least two additional evenly  spaced speed points between the starting speed and the maximum speed  point.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compare the calculated roll speed, vact, to each  corresponding speed set point, vref, to determine values for  speed error at each set point, verror, using the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.147   Example; vact = 8.3053 m/s vref = 8.3000 m/s verror = 8.3053 - 8.3000 = 0.0053 m/s</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Determine the speed error as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set the dynamometer to speed-control mode. Set the dynamometer  speed to a speed value of approximately 4.5 m/s (10 mph). Tune the  stroboscope or photo tachometer until the signal matches the dynamometer   roll speed. Record the frequency.

The speed error determined in paragraph  (c) of this section may not exceed 0.02 m/s at any  speed set point.  [79 FR 23823, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9120, Feb. 19, 2015]</p>
