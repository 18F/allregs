                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability of credit. A Reserve Bank shall give credit to the  sender for the proceeds of a noncash item when it receives payment in  actually and finally collected funds (or advice from another Reserve  Bank of such payment to it). The amount of the item is counted toward  the balance maintained to satisfy a reserve balance requirement for  purposes of part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) and becomes  available for use by the sender when the Reserve Bank receives the  payment or advice, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time schedule. A Reserve Bank may give credit for the proceeds  of a noncash item subject to payment in actually and finally collected  funds in accordance with a time schedule included in its operating  circulars. The time schedule shall indicate when the proceeds of the  noncash item will be counted toward the balance maintained to satisfy a  reserve balance requirement for purposes of part 204 of this chapter  (Regulation D) and become available for use by the sender. A Reserve  Bank may, however, refuse at any time to permit the use of credit given  by it for a noncash item for which the Reserve Bank has not yet received  payment in actually and finally collected funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Handling of payment. If a Reserve Bank receives, in payment for  a noncash item, a bank draft of other form of payment that it elects to  handle as a noncash item, the Reserve Bank shall neither count the  proceeds toward the balance maintained to satisfy a reserve balance  requirement for purposes of part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) nor  make the proceeds available for use until it receives payment in  actually and finally collected funds.
