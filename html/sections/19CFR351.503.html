                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> prescribes the specific rule  for measurement of the benefit of grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other subsidies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For other government programs,  the Secretary normally will consider a benefit to be conferred where a  firm pays less for its inputs (e.g., money, a good, or a service) than  it otherwise would pay in the absence of the government program, or  receives more revenues than it otherwise would earn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not intended to  limit the ability of the Secretary to impose countervailing duties when  the facts of a particular case establish that a financial contribution  (or income or price support) has conferred a benefit, even if that  benefit does not take the form of a reduction in input costs or an  enhancement of revenues. When paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not  applicable, the Secretary will determine whether a benefit is conferred  by examining whether the alleged program or practice has common or  similar elements to the four illustrative examples in sections  771(5)(E)(i) through (iv) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Distinction from effect of subsidy. In determining whether a  benefit is conferred, the Secretary is not required to consider the  effect of the government action on the firm's performance, including its  prices or output, or how the firm's behavior otherwise is altered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Varying financial contribution levels--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Where a  government program provides varying levels of financial contributions  based on different eligibility criteria, and one or more of such levels  is not specific within the meaning of Sec. 351.502, a benefit is  conferred to the extent that a firm receives a greater financial  contribution than the financial contributions provided at a non-specific  level under the program. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the  extent the Secretary determines that the varying levels of financial  contributions are set forth in a statute, decree, regulation, or other  official act; that the levels are clearly delineated and identifiable;  and that the firm would have been eligible for the non-specific level of  contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply  where the statute specifies a commercial test for determining the  benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tax consequences. In calculating the amount of a benefit, the  Secretary will not consider the tax consequences of the benefit.</p>
