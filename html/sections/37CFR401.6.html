                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following procedures shall govern the exercise of the march- in rights of the agencies set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and paragraph (j)  of the clause at Sec.  401.14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever an agency receives information that it believes might  warrant the exercise of march-in rights, before initiating any march-in  proceeding, it shall notify the contractor in writing of the information  and request informal written or oral comments from the contractor as  well as information relevant to the matter. In the absence of any  comments from the contractor within 30 days, the agency may, at its  discretion, proceed with the procedures below. If a comment is received  within 30 days, or later if the agency has not initiated the procedures  below, then the agency shall, within 60 days after it receives the  comment, either initiate the procedures below or notify the contractor,  in writing, that it will not pursue march-in rights on the basis of the  available information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A march-in proceeding shall be initiated by the issuance of a  written notice by the agency to the contractor and its assignee or  exclusive licensee, as applicable and if known to the agency, stating  that the agency is considering the exercise of march-in rights. The  notice shall state the reasons for the proposed march-in in terms  sufficient to put the contractor on notice of the facts upon which the  action would be based and shall specify the field or fields of use in  which the agency is considering requiring licensing. The notice shall  advise the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) of its rights, as  set forth in this section and in any supplemental agency regulations.  The determination to exercise march-in rights shall be made by the head  of the agency or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 30 days after the receipt of the written notice of march- in, the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) may submit in  person, in writing, or through a representative, information or argument  in opposition to the proposed march-in, including any additional  specific information which raises a genuine dispute over the material  facts upon which the march-in is based. If the information presented  raises a genuine dispute over the material facts, the head of the agency  or designee shall undertake or refer the matter to another official for  fact-finding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fact-finding shall be conducted in accordance with the  procedures established by the agency. Such procedures shall be as  informal as practicable and be consistent with principles of fundamental  fairness. The procedures should afford the contractor the opportunity to  appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and  confront such persons as the agency may present. A transcribed record  shall be made and shall be available at cost to the contractor upon  request. The requirement for a transcribed record may be waived by  mutual agreement of the contractor and the agency. Any portion of the  march-in proceeding, including a fact-finding hearing that involves  testimony or evidence relating to the utilization or efforts at  obtaining utilization that are being made by the contractor, its  assignee, or licensees shall be closed to the public, including  potential licensees. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), agencies  shall not disclose any such information obtained during a march-in  proceeding to persons outside the government except when such release is  authorized by the contractor (assignee or licensee).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The official conducting the fact-finding shall prepare or adopt  written findings of fact and transmit them to the head of the agency or  designee promptly after the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding  along with a recommended determination. A copy of the findings of fact  shall be sent to the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) by  registered or certified mail. The contractor (assignee or exclusive  licensee) and agency representatives will be given 30 days to submit  written arguments to the head of the agency or   designee; and, upon request by the contractor oral arguments will be  held before the agency head or designee that will make the final  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In cases in which fact-finding has been conducted, the head of  the agency or designee shall base his or her determination on the facts  found, together with any other information and written or oral arguments  submitted by the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) and agency  representatives, and any other information in the administrative record.  The consistency of the exercise of march-in rights with the policy and  objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200 shall also be considered. In cases referred  for fact-finding, the head of the agency or designee may reject only  those facts that have been found to be clearly erroneous, but must  explicitly state the rejection and indicate the basis for the contrary  finding. Written notice of the determination whether march-in rights  will be exercised shall be made by the head of the agency or designee  and sent to the contractor (assignee of exclusive licensee) by certified  or registered mail within 90 days after the completion of fact-finding  or 90 days after oral arguments, whichever is later, or the proceedings  will be deemed to have been terminated and thereafter no march-in based  on the facts and reasons upon which the proceeding was initiated may be  exercised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An agency may, at any time, terminate a march-in proceeding if  it is satisfied that it does not wish to exercise march-in rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The procedures of this part shall also apply to the exercise of  march-in rights against inventors receiving title to subject inventions  under 35 U.S.C. 202(d) and, for that purpose, the term ``contractor'' as  used in this section shall be deemed to include the inventor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An agency determination unfavorable to the contractor (assignee  or exclusive licensee) shall be held in abeyance pending the exhaustion  of appeals or petitions filed under 35 U.S.C. 203(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> For purposes of this section the term exclusive licensee  includes a partially exclusive licensee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Agencies are authorized to issue supplemental procedures not  inconsistent with this part for the conduct of march-in proceedings.</p>
