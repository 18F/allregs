                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procurement. For the procurement of property (goods, supplies,  or equipment) and services, the recipient and its subrecipients must  comply with the codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest requirements  under 24 CFR 85.36 (for governments) and 24 CFR 84.42 (for private  nonprofit organizations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuum of Care board members. No Continuum of Care board  member may participate in or influence discussions or resulting  decisions concerning the award of a grant or other financial benefits to  the organization that the member represents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Organizational conflict. An organizational conflict of interest  arises when, because of activities or relationships with other persons  or organizations, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or potentially  unable to render impartial assistance in the provision of any type or  amount of assistance under this part, or when a covered person's, as in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, objectivity in performing work with  respect to any activity assisted under this part is or might be  otherwise impaired. Such an organizational conflict would arise when a  board member of an applicant participates in decision of the applicant  concerning the award of a grant, or provision of other financial  benefits, to the organization that such member represents. It would also  arise when an employee of a recipient or subrecipient participates in  making rent reasonableness determinations under Sec.  578.49(b)(2) and  Sec.  578.51(g) and housing quality inspections of property under Sec.   578.75(b) that the recipient, subrecipient, or related entity owns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other conflicts. For all other transactions and activities, the  following restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No covered person, meaning a person who is an employee, agent,  consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient  or its subrecipients and who exercises or has exercised any functions or  responsibilities with respect to activities assisted under this part, or  who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain  inside information with regard to activities assisted under this part,  may obtain a financial interest or benefit from an assisted activity,  have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement  with respect to an assisted activity, or have a financial interest in  the proceeds derived from an assisted activity, either for him or  herself or for those with whom he or she has immediate family or  business ties, during his or her tenure or during the one-year period  following his or her tenure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only  after the recipient has provided the following documentation:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by a  written assurance, if the recipient is a government, that there has been  public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public  disclosure was made; and if the recipient is a private   nonprofit organization, that the conflict has been disclosed in  accordance with their written code of conduct or other conflict-of- interest policy; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for  which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law, or  if the subrecipient is a private nonprofit organization, the exception  would not violate the organization's internal policies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether  to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily  met the threshold requirements under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section, HUD must conclude that the exception will serve to further the  purposes of the Continuum of Care program and the effective and  efficient administration of the recipient's or subrecipient's project,  taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as  applicable:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit  or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would  otherwise not be available;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding  or negotiation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her  functions, responsibilities, or the decision-making process with respect  to the specific activity in question;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected  person was in the position described in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Whether undue hardship will result to the recipient, the  subrecipient, or the person affected, when weighed against the public  interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of  persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and  the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same  interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the  group or class; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Any other relevant considerations.</p>
