A complete submission of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification includes the form and the initial recruitment report.</p><p class="depth0">Area of intended employment means the geographic area within normal commuting distance of the place (worksite address) of the job opportunity for which the certification is

sought. There is no rigid measure of distance which constitutes a normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual circumstances among different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the worksite, quality of the regional transportation network, etc.). If the place of intended employment is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment. The borders of MSAs are not controlling in the identification of the normal commuting area; a location outside of an MSA may be within normal commuting distance of a location that is inside (e.g., near the border of) the MSA.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Homeland Security (DHS) means the Federal agency having control over certain immigration functions that, through its sub-agency, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), makes the determination under the INA on whether to grant visa petitions filed by employers seeking H-2A workers to perform temporary agricultural work in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0">DOL or Department means the United States Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible worker means an individual who is not an unauthorized alien (as defined in sec. 274A(h)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)) with respect to the employment in which the worker is engaging.</p><p class="depth0">Employee means employee as defined under the general common law of agency.

employs, furnishes, houses, or transports any worker subject to sec. 218 of the INA or these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">H-2A worker means any temporary foreign worker who is lawfully present in the U.S. to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature pursuant to sec. 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the INA, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">INA/Act means the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.</p><p class="depth0">Job offer means the offer made by an employer or potential employer of H-2A workers to eligible workers describing all the material terms and conditions of employment, including those relating to wages, working conditions, and other benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Job opportunity means a job opening for temporary, full-time employment at a place in the U.S. to which a U.S. worker can be referred.</p><p class="depth0">Joint employment means that where two or more employers each have sufficient definitional indicia of employment to be considered the employer of an employee, those employers will be considered to jointly employ that employee.

labor certification, including conducting housing inspections.</p><p class="depth0">Successor in interest means that, in determining whether an employer is a successor in interest, the factors used under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act will be considered. When considering whether an employer is a successor for purposes of this part, the primary consideration will be the personal involvement of the firm's ownership, management, supervisors, and others associated with the firm in the violations resulting in a debarment recommendation. Normally, wholly new management or ownership of the same business operation, one in which the former management or owner does not retain a direct or indirect interest, will not be deemed to be a successor in interest for purposes of debarment. A determination of whether or not a successor in interest exists is based on the entire circumstances viewed in their totality.

In the absence of a separate written work contract incorporating the required terms and conditions of employment, agreed to by both the employer and the worker, the work contract at a minimum shall be the terms of the job order, as provided in 20 CFR part 653, subpart F, and covered provisions of the work contract shall be enforced in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature.
