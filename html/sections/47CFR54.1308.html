                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of calculating the expense adjustment, the study area total unseparated loop cost equals the sum of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return component for net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF; subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line CO Circuit Equipment Category 4.13 investment. This amount is calculated by deducting the accumulated depreciation and noncurrent deferred Federal income taxes attributable to C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line Category 4.13 circuit investment reported pursuant to Sec. 54.1305(b) from the gross investment in Exchange Line C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 and CO Category 4.13 reported pursuant to Sec. 54.1305(a) to obtain the net unseparated C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment. The net unseparated C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 investment and CO Category 4.13 investment is multiplied by the study area's authorized interstate rate of return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation expense attributable to C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in Sec. 54.1305(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintenance expense attributable to C&WF; Subcategory 1.3 investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in Sec. 54.1305(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Corporate Operations Expenses, Operating Taxes and the benefits and rent portions of operating expenses, as reported in Sec. 54.1305(e) attributable to investment in C&WF; Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13. This amount is calculated by multiplying the total amount of these expenses and taxes by the ratio of the unseparated gross exchange plant investment in C&WF; Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13, as reported in Sec. 54.1305(a), to the unseparated gross telecommunications plant investment, as reported in Sec. 54.1305(f).
