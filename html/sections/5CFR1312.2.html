                            <p class="depth0">The effectiveness of the classification and declassification program in OMB depends entirely on the amount of attention paid to it by supervisors and their staffs in those offices and divisions that possess or produce classified material. Officials who originate classified information are responsible for proper assignment of a classification to that material and for the decision as to its declassification. Officials who produce documents containing classified information must determine the source of the classification for that information and must ensure that the proper identity of that source is shown on the document. Custodians of classified material are responsible for its safekeeping and for ensuring that such material is adequately marked as to current classification. Custodians are also responsible for the control of and accounting for all classified material within their area of jurisdiction as prescribed in OMB Manual Section 1030.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EOP Security Officer.
