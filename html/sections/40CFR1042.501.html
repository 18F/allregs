                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the equipment and procedures for compression-ignition  engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether engines meet the duty- cycle emission standards in Sec. Sec.  1042.101 or 1042.104. Measure the  emissions of all regulated pollutants as specified in 40 CFR part 1065.  Use the applicable duty cycles specified in Sec.  1042.505.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1042.515 describes the supplemental test procedures for  evaluating whether engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in  Sec.  1042.101(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part 1065,  subpart H, for all the testing we require in this part, except as  specified in this section and Sec.  1042.515.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially  available   fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For diesel-fueled engines, use the appropriate diesel fuel  specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, for emission testing. Unless  we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel for Category 1  and Category 2 engines is the ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel. If we allow  you to use a test fuel with higher sulfur levels, identify the test fuel  in your application for certification. Unless we specify otherwise, the  appropriate diesel test fuel for Category 3 engines is the high-sulfur  diesel fuel. For Category 2 and Category 3 engines, you may ask to use  commercially available diesel fuel similar but not necessarily identical  to the applicable fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H; we will  approve your request if you show us that it does not affect your ability  to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Category 1 and Category 2 engines that are expected to use a  type of fuel (or mixed fuel) other than diesel fuel (such as natural  gas, methanol, or residual fuel), use a commercially available fuel of  that type for emission testing. If a given engine is designed to operate  on different fuels, we may (at our discretion) require testing on each  fuel. Propose test fuel specifications that take into account the engine  design and the properties of commercially available fuels. Describe  these test fuel specifications in the application for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may use special or alternate procedures to the extent we  allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it  applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we  perform testing to determine if your engines meet emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duty-cycle testing is limited to ambient temperatures of 20 to  30 [deg]C. Atmospheric pressure must be between 91.000 and 103.325 kPa,  and must be within 5 percent of the value recorded  at the time of the last engine map. Testing may be performed with any  ambient humidity level. Correct duty-cycle NOX emissions for  humidity as specified in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For Category 3 engines, instead of test data collected as  specified in 40 CFR part 1065, you may submit test data for  NOX, HC, and CO emissions that were collected as specified in  the NOX Technical Code (incorporated by reference in Sec.   1042.910). For example, this allowance includes the allowance to perform  the testing using test fuels allowed under the NOX Technical  Code that do not meet the sulfur specifications of this section. We may  require you to include a brief engineering analysis showing how these  data demonstrate that your engines would meet the applicable emission  standards if you had used the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part  1065.
