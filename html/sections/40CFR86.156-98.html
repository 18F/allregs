                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The calculation of the net hydrocarbon mass change and methanol  mass change (if applicable) in the enclosure is used to determine  refueling mass emissions. The mass is calculated from initial and final  hydrocarbon and methanol (if applicable) concentrations in ppm carbon,  initial and final enclosure ambient temperatures, initial and final  barometric pressures, and net enclosure volume using the equations of  Sec. 86.143-96. For vehicles with multiple tanks, the results for each  tank shall be calculated and then summed to determine overall refueling  emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The final results for comparison with the refueling control  emission standard shall be computed by dividing the total refueling mass  emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test  (see Sec. 86.154-98(e)(7)(ii)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The results of all emission tests shall be rounded, in  accordance with ASTM E 29-67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in  Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii)) to the number of decimal places  contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one  additional significant figure.
