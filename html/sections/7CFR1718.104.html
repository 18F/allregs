In the case of Contemporaneous Loans and RUS Notes existing prior to the date of this Agreement under previous agreements, prepayments shall be treated as if governed by this section.

The provisions of this subsection shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts due hereunder or due on the Note.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.5. No Waiver</p><p class="depth0">No failure on the part of RUS to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise by RUS of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.6. Governing Law</p><p class="depth0">EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT GOVERNED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE [IN WHICH THE BORROWER IS INCORPORATED].</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.7.

Rescission</p><p class="depth0">The Borrower may elect not to borrow the RUS Commitment in which event RUS shall release the Borrower from its obligations hereunder, provided the Borrower complies with such terms and conditions as RUS may impose for such release and provided also that if the Borrower has any remaining obligations to RUS for loans made or guaranteed by RUS under any Prior Loan Contracts, RUS may, under Section [9.15] of this Loan Contract, withhold such release until all such obligations have been satisfied and discharged.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.9.

Complete Agreement; Amendments</p><p class="depth0">Subject to RUS Regulations, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are intended by the parties to be a complete and final expression of their agreement. However, RUS reserves the right to waive its rights to compliance with any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision hereof or thereof, and no consent to any departure of the Borrower herefrom or therefrom, shall be effective unless approved in writing by RUS in the form of either a RUS Regulation or other writing signed by or on behalf of RUS, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.11. Headings</p><p class="depth0">The headings and sub-headings contained in the titling of this Agreement are intended to be used for convenience only and do not constitute part of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.12. Severability</p><p class="depth0">If any term, provision or condition, or any part thereof, of this Agreement or the Mortgage shall for any reason be found or held invalid or unenforceable by any governmental agency or court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of such term, provision

or condition nor any other term, provision or condition, and this Agreement, the Note, and the Mortgage shall survive and be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable term, provision or condition had not been contained therein.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.13. Right of Setoff</p><p class="depth0">Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, RUS is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, to exercise rights of setoff or recoupment and apply any and all amounts held or hereafter held, by RUS or owed to the Borrower or for the credit or account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing hereunder or under the Note. RUS agrees to notify the Borrower promptly after any such setoff or recoupment and the application thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff, recoupment or application. The rights of RUS under this section are in addition to any other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff or recoupment) which RUS may have. Borrower waives all rights of setoff, deduction, recoupment or counterclaim.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.14. Schedules and Exhibits</p><p class="depth0">Each Schedule and Exhibit attached hereto and referred to herein is each an integral part of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.15. Prior Loan Contracts</p><p class="depth0">It is understood and agreed that with respect to all loan agreements previously entered into by and between RUS and the Borrower (hereinafter being referred to as ``Prior Loan Contracts'') the Borrower shall be required, after the date hereof, to meet affirmative and negative covenants as set forth in this Agreement rather than those set forth in the Prior Loan Contracts. In addition, any remaining obligation of RUS to make additional advances on promissory notes of the Borrower that have been previously delivered to RUS under Prior Loan Contracts shall, after the date hereof, be subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between any provision set forth in a Prior Loan Contract and any provision in this Agreement, the requirements as set forth in this Agreement shall apply. Nothing in this section shall, however, eliminate or modify any special condition, special affirmative covenant or special negative covenant, if any, unless specifically agreed to in writing by RUS.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.16. Authority of Representatives of RUS</p><p class="depth0">In the case of any consent, approval or waiver from RUS that is required under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, such consent, approval or waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized RUS representative to be effective. As used in this section, ``authorized RUS representative'' means the Administrator of RUS, and also means a person to whom the Administrator has officially delegated specific or general authority to take the action in question.</p><p class="depth0">Section 9.17. Term</p><p class="depth0">This Agreement shall remain in effect until one of the following two events has occurred:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Borrower and RUS replace this Agreement with another written agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All of the Borrower's obligations under the prior loan contracts and this Agreement have been discharged and paid.</p><p class="depth0">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
