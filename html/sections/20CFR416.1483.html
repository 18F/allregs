                            <p class="depth0">When a Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, the Appeals Council, acting on behalf of the Commissioner, may make a decision, or it may remand the case to an administrative law judge with instructions to take action and issue a decision or return the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision. If the case is remanded by the Appeals Council, the procedures explained in Sec. 416.1477 will be followed. Any issues relating to

your claim may be considered by the administrative law judge whether or not they were raised in the administrative proceedings leading to the final decision in your case.
