                                Sec. 779.416  What compensation ``represents commissions.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employment arrangements which provide for a commission on goods  or services to be paid to an employee of a retail or service  establishment may also provide, as indicated in Sec. 779.413, for the  payment to the employee at a regular pay period of a fixed sum of money,  which may bear a more or less fixed relationship to the commission  earnings which could be expected, on the basis of experience, for an  average period of the same length. Such periodic payments, which are  variously described in retail or service establishments as ``advances,''  ``draws,'' or ``guarantees,'' are keyed to a time base and are usually  paid at weekly or other fixed intervals which may in some instances be  different from and more frequent than, the intervals for payment of any  earnings computed exclusively on a commission basis. They are normally  smaller in amount than the commission earnings expected for such a  period and if they prove to be greater, a deduction of the excess amount  from commission earnings for a subsequent period, if otherwise lawful,  may or may not be customary under the employment arrangement. A  determination of whether or to what extent such periodic payments can be  considered to represent commissions may be required in those situations  where the employment arrangement is that the employee will be paid the  stipulated sum, or the commission earnings allocable to the same period,  whichever is the greater amount. The stipulated sum can never represent  commissions, of course, if it is actually paid as a salary. If, however,  it appears from all the facts and circumstances of the employment that  the stipulated sum is not so paid and that it actually functions as an  integral part of a true commission basis of payment, then such  compensation may qualify as compensation which ``represents commissions  on goods or services'' within the meaning of clause (2) of the section  7(i) exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The express statutory language of section 7(i), as amended in  1966, provides that ``In determining the proportion of compensation  representing commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of  a bona fide commission rate shall be deemed commissions on goods or  services without regard to whether the computed commissions exceed the  draw or guarantee'' which may be paid to the employee. Thus an employee  who is paid a guarantee or draw against commissions computed in  accordance with a bona fide commission payment plan or formula under  which the computed commissions vary in accordance with the employee's  performance on the job will qualify for exemption provided the  conditions of 7(i)(1) are met as explained in Sec. 779.419. Under a  bona fide commission plan all of the computed commissions will be  counted as compensation representing commissions even though the   amount of commissions may not equal or exceed the guarantee or draw in  some workweeks. The exemption will also apply in the case of an employee  who is paid a fixed salary plus an additional amount of earned  commissions if the amount of commission payments exceeds the total  amount of salary payments for the representative period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A commission rate is not bona fide if the formula for computing  the commissions is such that the employee, in fact, always or almost  always earns the same fixed amount of compensation for each workweek (as  would be the case where the computed commissions seldom or never equal  or exceed the amount of the draw or guarantee). Another example of a  commission plan which would not be considered as bona fide is one in  which the employee receives a regular payment consituting nearly his  entire earnings which is expressed in terms of a percentage of the sales  which the establishment or department can always be expected to make  with only a slight addition to his wages based upon a greatly reduced  percentage applied to the sales above the expected quota.</p>
