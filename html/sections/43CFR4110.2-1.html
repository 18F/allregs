Where  such waters become unusable and are replaced by newly constructed or  reconstructed water developments that are the subject of a range  improvement permit or cooperative range improvement agreement, the  permittee's or lessee's interest in the replacement water shall be  deemed sufficient in meeting the requirement that the applicant control  base property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a permittee or lessee loses ownership or control of all or  part of his/her base property, the permit or lease, to the extent it was  based upon such lost property, shall terminate immediately without  further notice from the authorized officer. However, if, prior to losing  ownership or control of the base property, the permittee or lessee  requests, in writing, that the permit or lease be extended to the end of  the grazing season or grazing year, the termination date may be extended  as determined by the authorized officer after consultation with the new  owner. When a permit or lease terminates because of a loss of ownership  or control of a base property, the grazing preference shall remain with  the base property and be available through application and transfer  procedures at 43 CFR 4110.2-3, to the new owner or person in control of  that base property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicants who own or control base property contiguous to or  cornering upon public land outside a grazing district where such public  land consists of an isolated or disconnected tract embracing 760 acres  or less shall, for a period of 90 days after the tract has been offered  for lease, have a preference right to lease the whole tract.
