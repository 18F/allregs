The  Commission will approve an applicant's implementation of this section if  it determines that the process for categorization of RISC-1, RISC-2,  RISC-3, and RISC-4 SSCs satisfies the requirements of Sec. 50.69(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> SSC Categorization Process. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> SSCs must be categorized as  RISC-1, RISC-2, RISC-3, or RISC-4 SSCs using a categorization process  that determines if an SSC performs one or more safety significant  functions and identifies those functions. The process must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consider results and insights from the plant-specific PRA. This  PRA must at a minimum model severe accident scenarios resulting from  internal initiating events occurring at full power operation. The PRA  must be of sufficient quality and level of detail to support the  categorization process, and must be subjected to a peer review process  assessed against a standard or set of acceptance criteria that is  endorsed by the NRC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine SSC functional importance using an integrated,  systematic process for addressing initiating events (internal and  external), SSCs, and plant operating modes, including those not modeled  in the plant-specific PRA. The functions to be identified and considered  include design bases functions and functions credited for mitigation and  prevention of severe accidents. All aspects of the integrated,  systematic process used to characterize SSC importance must reasonably  reflect the current plant configuration and operating practices, and  applicable plant and industry operational experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain defense-in-depth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Include evaluations that provide reasonable confidence that for  SSCs categorized as RISC-3, sufficient safety margins are maintained and  that any potential increases in core damage frequency (CDF) and large  early release frequency (LERF) resulting from changes in treatment  permitted by implementation of Sec. Sec. 50.69(b)(1) and (d)(2) are  small.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Be performed for entire systems and structures, not for selected  components within a system or structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The SSCs must be categorized by an Integrated Decision-Making  Panel (IDP) staffed with expert, plant-knowledgeable members whose  expertise includes, at a minimum, PRA, safety analysis, plant operation,  design engineering, and system engineering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternative treatment requirements--(1) RISC-1 and RISC 2 SSCs.  The licensee or applicant shall ensure that RISC-1 and RISC-2 SSCs  perform their functions consistent with the categorization process  assumptions by evaluating treatment being applied to these SSCs to  ensure that it supports the key assumptions in the categorization  process that relate to their assumed performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> RISC-3 SSCs. The licensee or applicant shall ensure, with  reasonable confidence, that RISC-3 SSCs remain capable of performing  their safety-related functions under design basis conditions, including  seismic conditions and environmental conditions and effects throughout  their service life. The treatment of RISC-3 SSCs must be consistent with  the categorization process. Inspection and testing, and corrective  action shall be provided for RISC-3 SSCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and testing. Periodic inspection and testing  activities must be conducted to determine that RISC-   3 SSCs will remain capable of performing their safety-related functions  under design basis conditions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corrective action. Conditions that would prevent a RISC-3 SSC  from performing its safety-related functions under design basis  conditions must be corrected in a timely manner. For significant  conditions adverse to quality, measures must be taken to provide  reasonable confidence that the cause of the condition is determined and  corrective action taken to preclude repetition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Feedback and process adjustment--(1) RISC-1, RISC-2, RISC-3 and  RISC-4 SSCs. The licensee shall review changes to the plant, operational  practices, applicable plant and industry operational experience, and, as  appropriate, update the PRA and SSC categorization and treatment  processes. The licensee shall perform this review in a timely manner but  no longer than once every two refueling outages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> RISC-1 and RISC-2 SSCs. The licensee shall monitor the  performance of RISC-1 and RISC-2 SSCs. The licensee shall make  adjustments as necessary to either the categorization or treatment  processes so that the categorization process and results are maintained  valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> RISC-3 SSCs. The licensee shall consider data collected in Sec.  50.69(d)(2)(i) for RISC-3 SSCs to determine if there are any adverse  changes in performance such that the SSC unreliability values approach  or exceed the values used in the evaluations conducted to satisfy Sec.  50.69(c)(1)(iv). The licensee shall make adjustments as necessary to the  categorization or treatment processes so that the categorization process  and results are maintained valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Program documentation, change control and records. (1) The  licensee or applicant shall document the basis for its categorization of  any SSC under paragraph (c) of this section before removing any  requirements under Sec. 50.69(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> for those SSCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Following implementation of this section, licensees and  applicants shall update their final safety analysis report (FSAR) to  reflect which systems have been categorized, in accordance with Sec.  50.71(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a licensee first implements this section for a SSC, changes  to the FSAR for the implementation of the changes in accordance with  Sec. 50.69(d) need not include a supporting Sec. 50.59 evaluation of  the changes directly related to implementation. Thereafter, changes to  the programs and procedures for implementation of Sec. 50.69(d), as  described in the FSAR, may be made if the requirements of this section  and Sec. 50.59 continue to be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a licensee first implements this section for a SSC, changes  to the quality assurance plan for the implementation of the changes in  accordance with Sec. 50.69(d) need not include a supporting Sec.  50.54(a) review of the changes directly related to implementation.  Thereafter, changes to the programs and procedures for implementation of  Sec. 50.69(d), as described in the quality assurance plan may be made  if the requirements of this section and Sec. 50.54(a) continue to be  met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reporting.
