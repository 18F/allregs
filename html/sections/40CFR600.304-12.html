                                Sec. 600.304-12  Fuel economy label--special requirements for hydrogen fuel
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Fuel economy labels for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles must meet the  specifications described in Sec. 600.302, with the following  modifications:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Include the following statement instead of the statement  specified in Sec. 600.302-12(b)(4): ``Actual results will vary for many  reasons, including driving conditions and how you drive and maintain  your vehicle. The average new vehicle gets a MPG and costs $b to fuel  over 5 years. Cost estimates are based on c miles per year at $d per  kilogram of hydrogen. Vehicle emissions are a significant cause of  global warming and smog.'' For a, b, c, and d, insert   the appropriate values established by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Include the following elements instead of the information  identified in Sec. 600.302-12(c)(1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The heading ``Fuel Economy'' near the top left corner of the  field.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The combined fuel economy value as determined in Sec. 600.311  below the heading. Include the expression ``combined city/hwy'' below  this number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> to the left of  the combined fuel economy value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The units identifier and specific fuel economy values to the  right of the combined fuel economy value as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include the term ``MPGe'' in the upper portion of the designated  space.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include the city fuel economy value determined in Sec. 600.311  in the lower left portion of the designated space. Include the  expression ``city'' below this number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include the highway fuel economy value determined in  Sec. 600.311 in the lower right portion of the designated space. Include  the expression ``highway'' below this number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The fuel consumption rate determined in Sec. 600.311, to the  right of the fuel economy information. Include the expression ``kg  H2 per 100 miles'' below the numerical value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The sub-heading ``Driving Range'' below the combined fuel  economy value. Below this sub-heading, insert a horizontal range bar  nominally 80 mm long to show how far the vehicle can drive when fully  fueled. Include a vehicle logo at the right end of the range bar.  Include the following left-justified expression inside the range bar:  ``When fully fueled, vehicle can travel about * * *''. Below the right  end of the range bar, include the expression ``x miles''; complete the  expression by identifying the appropriate value for total driving range  from Sec. 600.311. Include numbers below the bar showing the scale, with  numbers starting at 0 and increasing in equal increments. Use good  engineering judgment to divide the range bar into four, five, or six  increments.  [76 FR 39561, July 6, 2011]</p>
