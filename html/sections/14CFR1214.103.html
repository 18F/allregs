                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of price. NASA will establish, and update as appropriate, the standard flight price under this Sec. 1214.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Advance pricing. NASA normally will agree to a standard flight price no later than 3 years in advance of launch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Price stability. The standard flight price will be fixed, subject to the terms of the launch agreement, and subject to escalation pursuant to Sec. 1214.103(d), and will be the price set by NASA as of the time of signing a launch agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Escalation of payments. With the exception of payments for earnest money, all payments will be escalated according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Index, ``Private Business Sector, All Persons: Productivity, Hourly Compensation, Unit Labor Cost and Prices Seasonally Adjusted'' table, ``Compensation, Per Hour,'' column published in the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, news release entitled ``Productivity and Costs.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Independence of pricing and manifesting. The standard flight price for a shared flight payload as computed from 1214.103(g) will be independent from the actual payload manifest for a specific shared flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Allocation of services. (1) Customers contracting for a dedicated flight are eligible for the full standard services, as defined in Sec. 1214.115, available on the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Customers contracting for a dedicated flight are eligible for the full standard services, as defined in Sec. 1214.115, available on the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Customers contracting for a standard shared flight meeting the criteria of Sec. 1214.117 are eligible for a portion of the standard services, as defined in Sec. 1214.115, available on the flight. The basis of apportionment will be determined by NASA and will be a function of the payload load factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Computation of prices. (1) The Shuttle standard flight price for a dedicated flight is the dedicated flight price as defined in Sec. 1214.102(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Shuttle standard flight price for a dedicated flight is the dedicated flight price as defined in Sec. 1214.102(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Shuttle standard flight price for a standard shared flight is the product of the payload's charge factor and the dedicated flight price as defined in Sec. 1214.102(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The computed charge factor for a payload is defined as:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.003</p><p class="depth0">If the computed charge factor exceeds 1.0, the charge factor will be 1.0.

For all other payloads, the lift capability for a shared flight, standard launch will be 21,542 kg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payment schedule--(1) Earnest money. Earnest money in the amount of $100,000 per payload will be paid to NASA by the customer. The earnest money will be paid at the time of submission of a NASA Form 1628, and will be applied to the first payment made by the customer toward the standard flight price, or will be retained by NASA unless NASA determines that the payload does not meet the eligibility criteria referenced in Sec. 1214.101.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Earnest money.
