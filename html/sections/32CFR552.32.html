                            <p class="depth0">While the Federal Government has the inherent power to acquire land  for its constitutional purposes, this power can be exercised only at the  discretion   of Congress (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151; 29 L. Ed. 845; 6  S. Ct. 670). No land shall be purchased on account of the United States,  except under a law authorizing such purchase (R. S. 3736; 41 U.S.C. 14).  No real estate not in Federal ownership shall be acquired by a military  department, except as such acquisition is or shall be expressly  authorized by law (section 501(b), Act July 27, 1954; Pub. L. 534, 83d  Congress; 68 Stat. 560).</p>
