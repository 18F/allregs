Service on inland waters may substitute  for up to 50 percent of the required service.

The endorsement will be limited to the maximum tonnage on  which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or  150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the  service was obtained, whichever is higher. However, the minimum tonnage  limitation calculated according to this paragraph will be 2,000 GRT.  Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT using the next higher figure  when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. In no case will the  limitation exceed 10,000 GRT/GT for OSVs unless the applicant meets the  full requirements for an unlimited tonnage endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A person holding an endorsement as master (OSV) may qualify for  an STCW endorsement, according to Secs. 11.305 and 11.311 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Coast Guard may exempt an applicant from meeting any  requirement under STCW Regulation II/2 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 11.102 of this part) that the Coast Guard determines to be  inappropriate or unnecessary for service on an OSV, or that the  applicant meets under the equivalency provisions of Article IX of STCW.
