Plan A, which reports on a calendar year basis, has total assets of $600,000 as of the end of the 1999 plan year. Plan A's assets, as of the end of year, include: investments in various bank, insurance company and mutual fund products of $520,000; investments in qualifying employer securities of $40,000; participant loans, meeting the requirements of ERISA section 408(b)(1), totaling $20,000; and a $20,000 investment in a real estate limited partnership. Because the only asset of the plan that does not constitute a ``qualifying plan asset'' is the $20,000 real estate investment and that investment represents less than 5% of the plan's total assets, no bond would be required under the proposal as a condition for the waiver for the 2000 plan year. By contrast, Plan B also has total assets of $600,000 as of the end of the 1999 plan year, of which $558,000 constitutes ``qualifying plan assets'' and $42,000 constitutes non-qualifying plan assets. Because 7%--more than 5%--of Plan B's assets do not constitute ``qualifying plan assets,'' Plan B, as a condition to electing the waiver for the 2000 plan year, must ensure that it has a fidelity bond in an amount equal to

at least $42,000 covering persons handling non-qualifying plan assets. Inasmuch as compliance with section 412 requires the amount of bonds to be not less than 10% of the amount of all the plan's funds or other property handled, the bond acquired for section 412 purposes may be adequate to cover the non-qualifying plan assets without an increase (i.e., if the amount of the bond determined to be needed for the relevant persons for section 412 purposes is at least $42,000). As demonstrated by the foregoing example, where a plan has more than 5% of its assets in non-qualifying plan assets, the bond required by the proposal is for the total amount of the non-qualifying plan assets, not just the amount in excess of 5%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The administrator of an employee welfare benefit plan that covers fewer than 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year is not required to comply with annual reporting requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waiver. The administrator of a plan described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section is not required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Engage an independent qualified public accountant to conduct an examination of the financial statements of the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Include within the annual report the financial statements and schedules prescribed in section 103(b) of the Act and Secs. 2520.103-1, 2520.103-2, and 2520.103-10; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Include within the annual report a report of an independent qualified public accountant as prescribed in section 103(a)(3)(A) of the Act and Sec. 2520.103-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitations. (1) The waiver described in this section does not affect the obligation of a plan described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section to file a Form 5500 ``Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan,'' including any required schedules or statements prescribed by the instructions to the form. See Sec. 2520.104-41.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The waiver described in this section does not affect the obligation of a plan described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section to file a Form 5500 ``Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan,'' including any required schedules or statements prescribed by the instructions to the form. See Sec. 2520.104-41.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, an employee pension benefit plan for which simplified annual reporting has been prescribed includes an employee pension benefit plan which elects to file a Form 5500 as a small plan pursuant to Sec. 2520.103-1(d) with respect to the plan year for which the waiver is claimed. See Sec. 2520.104-41.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, an employee welfare benefit plan that covers fewer than 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year includes an employee welfare benefit plan which elects to file a Form 5500 as a small plan pursuant to Sec. 2520.103-1(d) with respect to the plan year for which the waiver is claimed. See Sec. 2520.104-41.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A plan that elects to file a Form 5500 as a large plan pursuant to Sec. 2520.103-1(d) may not claim a waiver under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Model notice. The appendix to this section contains model language for inclusion in the summary annual report to assist plan administrators in complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section to avail themselves of the waiver of examination and report of the independent qualified public accountant for employee benefit plans with fewer than 100 participants. Use of the model language is not mandatory. In order to use the model language in the plan's summary annual report, administrators must, in addition to any other information required to be in the summary annual report, select among alternative language and add relevant information where appropriate in the model language. Items of information that are not applicable to a particular plan may be deleted. Use of the model language, appropriately modified and supplemented, will be deemed to satisfy the notice content requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix to Sec. 2520.104-46--Model Summary Annual Report Notice (Plan Administrators Will Need to Modify the Model to Omit Information That Is</p><p class="depth0">Not Applicable to the Plan)</p><p class="depth0">The U.S. Department of Labor's regulations require that an independent qualified public accountant audit the plan's financial statements unless certain conditions are met for the audit requirement to be waived.
