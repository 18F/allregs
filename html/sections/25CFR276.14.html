These changes include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of grantee funds in furtherance of program objectives  over and above the grantee minimum share included in the approved grant  budget and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb  authorized increases in indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For construction grants, grantees shall request prior approval  promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective  of the grant-supported programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The revision increases the budgeted amounts of Bureau funds  needed to complete the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the Bureau awards a grant which provides support for both  construction and nonconstruction work, the Bureau may require, in the  grant agreement, the grantee to request prior approval before making any  fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For both construction and nonconstruction grants, the Bureau  shall require tribal grantees to notify the Bureau promptly whenever the  amount of Bureau authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the  grantee by more than $5,000 or 5 percent of the Bureau grant, whichever  is greater. This notification will not be required when applications for  additional funding are submitted for continuing grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When requesting approval for budget revisions, grantees shall  use the budget forms which were used in the grant application. However,  grantees may request by letter the approvals required by the provisions  of appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for  budget revisions, the Bureau shall review the request and notify the  grantee whether or not the budget revisions have been approved. If the  Bureau does not reach a decision prior to the end of the 30-day period  or should the grantee not be notified of the Bureau's decision by the  end of the 30-day period the grantee may appeal directly to the  Commissioner.</p>
