                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification process. Upon request, the Census Bureau certifies  population and housing counts of standard governmental units to reflect  boundary updates, including new incorporations, annexations, mergers,  and so forth. The Census Bureau will produce a certificate, that is, a  signed statement by a Census Bureau official attesting to the  authenticity of the certified Census 2000 population and housing counts  to reflect updates to the legal boundaries of governmental units after  those in effect for Census 2000. This service will be a permanent  process, but one that will be temporarily suspended during future  decennial censuses. Typically, the Census Bureau will suspend this  service, and direct its resources to the decennial census, for a total  of five years--the two years preceding the decennial census, the  decennial census year, and the two years following it. The Census Bureau  will issue notices in the Federal Register announcing when it suspends  and, in turn, resumes, the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Census Bureau charges customers a preset fee for this  service according to the amount of work involved in compiling the  population and housing counts, as determined by the resources expended  to meet customer requirements and the set cost of the product (one  certificate). Certification fees may increase somewhat if the customer  requests additional original certificates. Each additional certificate  costs $35.00. Certification prices are shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth3">Description and Estimated Fee ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Standard governmental units                 Estimated fee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Annual Certification...................  $693 to $1,799. Expedited Certification................  1,530 to 9,075. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of certification types. The Census Bureau will  process requests for population certificates for   standard governmental units, in accordance with the Census Bureau's  annual certification schedule or under an expedited certification  arrangement. The boundaries for standard governmental units are  regularly and customarily updated between decennial censuses by the  Census Bureau's geographic support system. These governmental units  include a variety of legally defined general- and special-purpose  governmental units, including counties and statistically equivalent  entities, minor civil divisions, incorporated places, consolidated  cities, federally recognized American Indian reservations, and school  districts. A complete list of entities is defined in paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual certification. Annual population and housing  certification is available around October 1 of each calendar year to new  or existing governmental units that report legal boundary updates in the  Census Bureau's annual Boundary and Annexation Survey. In accordance  with reporting requirements of this survey, the legally effective dates  of the boundary updates may not be later than January 1 of the calendar  year. These certifications are available through September of the  following year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The annual certification service also is available to standard  governmental units that are not in the Boundary and Annexation Survey of  that year. Governmental units electing participation in this service  must draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps.  The legally effective dates of the boundaries may not be later than  January 1 of the calendar year. The Census Bureau must receive the  census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries and  associated address ranges by April 1 of the same calendar year. The  Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are  acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and  usable, and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested by  the governmental unit as submitted in accordance with state law or  tribal authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expedited certification. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Expedited certification will be  available where the customer requests any of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Certification of boundary updates legally effective after  January 1 of the current calendar year; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certification of boundary updates reported to the Census Bureau  after April 1 of the current calendar year; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Certification of boundary updates by the Census Bureau before  October 1 of the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Governmental units electing participation in this service must  draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps. To  allow sufficient processing time, the Census Bureau must receive  acceptable census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries  and associated address ranges no later than three months before the date  requested by the customer to receive the population certificate. The  Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are  acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and  usable and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested as  submitted in accordance with state law or tribal authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> List of standard governmental units. The following is a list of  the standard governmental units eligible for the Geographically Updated  Population Certification Program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federally recognized American Indian reservations and off- reservation trust land entities [tribal government]; this includes a  reservation designated as a colony, community, Indian community, Indian  village, pueblo, rancheria, reservation, reserve, and village.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counties and statistically equivalent entities, including the  following: counties in 48 states; boroughs, municipalities, and census  areas in Alaska [state official]; parishes in Louisiana; and municipios  in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minor civil divisions as recognized in Census 2000 in the  following 28 states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,  Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,  Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,  North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania,   Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and  Wisconsin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Incorporated places, including the following: boroughs in  Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; cities in 49 states and the  District of Columbia; cities, boroughs, and municipalities in Alaska;  towns in 30 states (excluding towns in New England, New York, and  Wisconsin, which are minor civil divisions); and villages in 20 states.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Consolidated cities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> School districts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-standard certifications.

Submit requests for  certifications on Form BC-1869(EF), Request for Geographically Updated  Official Population Certification, to the Census Bureau by fax, (301)  457-4714, or by e-mail, MSO.certify@census.gov.
