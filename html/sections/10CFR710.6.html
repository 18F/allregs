                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> It is the responsibility of the individual to cooperate by providing full, frank, and truthful answers to DOE's relevant and material questions, and when requested, to furnish or authorize others to furnish information that the DOE deems pertinent to the individual's eligibility for DOE access authorization. This obligation to cooperate applies when completing security forms, during the course of a personnel security background investigation or reinvestigation, and at any stage of DOE's processing of the individual's access authorization, including but not limited to, personnel security interviews, DOE-sponsored mental evaluations, and other authorized DOE investigative activities under this subpart. The individual may elect not to cooperate; however, such refusal may prevent DOE from reaching an affirmative finding required for granting or continuing access authorization. In this event, any access authorization then in effect may be terminated, or, for applicants, further processing may be suspended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is the responsibility of the individual to cooperate by providing full, frank, and truthful answers to DOE's relevant and material questions, and when requested, to furnish or authorize others to furnish information that the DOE deems pertinent to the individual's eligibility for DOE access authorization.

In this event, DOE may suspend or terminate any access authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the individual believes that the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section have been inappropriately applied in his case, he may file a written appeal of the action with the Director, Office of Personnel Security, DOE Headquarters, within 30 calendar days of the date he was notified of the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of the written appeal, the Director, Office of Personnel Security, shall conduct an inquiry as to the circumstances involved in the action and shall, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written appeal, notify the individual, in writing, as to whether the action to terminate or suspend processing of access authorization was appropriate. If the Director determines that the action was inappropriate, he shall direct that the individual continue to be processed for access authorization, or that access authorization for the individual be reinstated.
