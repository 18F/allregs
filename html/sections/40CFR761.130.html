                            <p class="depth0">Postcleanup sampling is required to verify the level of cleanup  under Sec. 761.125(c) (2) through (4). The responsible party may use  any statistically valid, reproducible, sampling scheme (either random  samples or grid samples) provided that the requirements of paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The sampling area is the greater of (1) an area equal to the  area cleaned plus an additional 1-foot boundary, or (2) an area 20  percent larger than the original area of contamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The sampling scheme must ensure 95 percent confidence against  false positives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The number of samples must be sufficient to ensure that areas of  contamination of a radius of 2 feet or more within the sampling area  will be detected, except that the minimum number of samples is 3 and the  maximum number of samples is 40.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The sampling scheme must include calculation for expected  variability due to analytical error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EPA recommends the use of a sampling scheme developed by the  Midwest Research Institute (MRI) for use in enforcement inspections:  ``Verification of PCB Spill Cleanup by Sampling and Analysis.'' Guidance  for the use of this sampling scheme is available in the MRI report  ``Field Manual for Grid Sampling of PCB Spill Sites to Verify Cleanup.''  Both the MRI sampling scheme and the guidance document are available on  EPA's PCB Web site at http://www.epa.gov/pcb, or from the Program  Management, Communications, and Analysis Office, Office of Resource  Conservation and Recovery (5305P), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,  Washington, DC 20460-0001. The major advantage of this sampling scheme  is that it is designed to characterize the degree of contamination  within the entire sampling area with a high degree of confidence while  using fewer samples than any other grid or random sampling scheme. This  sampling scheme also allows some sites to be characterized on the basis  of composite samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> EPA may, at its discretion, take samples from any spill site. If  EPA's sampling indicates that the remaining concentration level exceeds  the required level, EPA will require further cleanup. For this purpose,  the numerical level of cleanup required for spills cleaned in accordance  with Sec. 761.125(b) is deemed to be the equivalent of numerical  cleanup requirements required for cleanups under Sec. 761.125(c) (2)  through (4). Using its best engineering judgment, EPA may sample a  statistically valid random or grid sampling technique, or both. When  using engineering judgment or random ``grab'' samples, EPA will take  into account that there are limits on the power of a grab sample to  dispute statistically based sampling of the type required of the  responsible party. EPA headquarters will provide guidance to the EPA  regions on the degree of certainty associated with various grab sample  results.
