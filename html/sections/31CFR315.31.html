                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Series H bonds are current income bonds issued at par (face amount). Interest on a Series H bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity, or if the bond is redeemed prior to final maturity, as of the end of the interest period last preceding the date of redemption. For example, if a bond on which interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 is redeemed on September 1, interest ceases as of the preceding July 1, and no interest will be paid for the period from July 1 to September 1. However, if the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date. Information regarding authorized extended maturity periods and investment yields is found in Department Circular No. 905, current revision (31 CFR part 332).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment of interest. Series H bond interest accounts are maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV. Interest is paid on each payment date by check drawn to the order of the owner or both coowners or, upon request, by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution. Checks will be mailed to the delivery address provided to the Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delivery of interest--(1) Notices affecting the delivery of interest payments. To ensure appropriate action, notices affecting the delivery of interest payments on Series H bonds must be received by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV, 26102-1328, at least one month prior to the interest payment date. Each notice must include the owner or coowner's name and the taxpayer identifying number appearing on the account under which records of the bonds are maintained.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535-0094)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notices affecting the delivery of interest payments. To ensure appropriate action, notices affecting the delivery of interest payments on Series H bonds must be received by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV, 26102-1328, at least one month prior to the interest payment date. Each notice must include the owner or coowner's name and the taxpayer identifying number appearing on the account under which records of the bonds are maintained.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535-0094)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Owner or coowner deceased--(i) Sole owner. Upon receipt of notice of the death of the owner of a bond, payment of interest will be suspended until satisfactory evidence is submitted as to who is authorized to receive and collect interest payments on behalf of the estate of the decedent, in accordance with the provisions of subpart L.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sole owner. Upon receipt of notice of the death of the owner of a bond, payment of interest will be suspended until satisfactory evidence is submitted as to who is authorized to receive and collect interest payments on behalf of the estate of the decedent, in accordance with the provisions of subpart L.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Coowner. Upon receipt of notice of the death of the ooowner to whom interest payments have been directed, payment of interest will be suspended until delivery instructions are received from the other coowner, if living. If both coowners are deceased, payment of interest will be suspended until satisfactory evidence is submitted as to who is authorized to receive and collect interest payments on behalf of the estate of the last deceased coowner, in accordance with the provisions of subpart L.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Owner with beneficiary. Interest on a bond registered in beneficiary form is paid to the owner during his or her lifetime. Upon receiving notice of the owner's death, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will suspend payment of interest until the bond is presented for payment or reissue by the beneficiary, if surviving, or some other proper party. Interest so withheld will be paid to the person entitled to the bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Representative appointed for the estate of a minor, incompetent, absentee, et al. Interest on Series H bonds is paid in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 315.60 to the representative appointed for the estate of an owner who is a minor, incompetent, absentee, et al. If the registration of the bonds does not include reference to the owner's status, the bonds should be submitted for reissue to a designated Federal Reserve Bank so that interest payments may be properly delivered. They must be accompanied by proof of appointment as required by Sec. 315.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adult incapacitated owner having no representative. If an adult owner of a Series H bond is incompetent to receive and collect interest payments, and no legal guardian or similar representative has been appointed to act for him or her, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may apply to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of receiving and collecting the payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reissue during interest period. Physical reissue of a Series H bond may be made without regard to interest payment dates. The Series H accounts maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal

Service will be closed in the first week of the month preceding each interest payment date, and payments will be made pursuant to the information contained in the accounts as of the date they are closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Endorsement of checks. Interest checks must be endorsed in accordance with the regulations governing the payment of fiscal agency checks contained in 31 CFR part 355.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Deposit account information for ACH payments--(1) Payments on same account. Payments on all Series H bonds assigned to the same account maintained by the Bureau will be made to the same deposit account at a financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payments on same account. Payments on all Series H bonds assigned to the same account maintained by the Bureau will be made to the same deposit account at a financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deposit account held by individuals in their own right. Where the Series H bonds are registered in the name of individual(s) as sole owner, or as owner and beneficiary, and the deposit account at the financial institution is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the owner's name must appear on the deposit account. Where the bonds are registered in the names of two individuals as coowners and the deposit account is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the registration of the bonds and the title of the account must contain at least one name that is common to both. The deposit account to which the interest payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the bonds to ensure that rights of ownership and survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interest(s) of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are directed are not the same as the owner(s) of the bonds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deposit account held by organization. Where the deposit account to which interest payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself, acting as sole trustee or as co-trustee, or is in the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, the owner or coowner should inquire whether the financial institution is able to receive ACH payments; if not, the owner or coowner should make alternative arrangements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial institution cannot accept ACH payments. If after submission of deposit account information, it is determined that ACH payments cannot be accepted by the designated financial institution, pending receipt of new deposit account information, payment will be made by check drawn to the registered owner or both coowners and mailed to the address of record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cancellation of ACH arrangement. An ACH arrangement shall remain in effect until it is terminated by a request from the owner or coowner submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rules. Series H interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Nonreceipt or loss of interest payment. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102 should be notified if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An interest check is not received or is lost after receipt or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An ACH payment is not credited to the designated account and the financial institution has no record of receiving it. The notice should include the owner or coowner's name and taxpayer identifying number and the interest payment date.
