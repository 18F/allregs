The nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration must appear at the designated office location, and on the specified date and time, unless otherwise specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of verification of information for registration pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration shall provide the Department of Homeland Security with proof of compliance with the conditions of his or her nonimmigrant visa status and admission, including, but not limited to, proof of residence, employment, or registration and matriculation at an approved school or educational institution.

A nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration may apply for relief from the registration requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Relief from departure controls set out in 264.1(f) (8). An alien who has been registered under the provisions of this section (f) and has not yet departed the United States may seek relief from the departure control requirement contained in paragraph (f)(8) for that admission by applying to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection field office director for the port from which the alien intends to depart. In making an application for relief, the alien must establish that exigent or unusual circumstances exist and that the alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Frequent travelers. An alien who previously has been registered and who would otherwise be subject to registration at a port of entry under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section may seek relief from the registration requirements from the Secretary of Homeland Security after his initial registration if the alien makes frequent trips to the United States. An alien seeking relief under this paragraph from the Secretary of Homeland Security may apply to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection field office director for the port to which the alien most frequently arrives in the United States. The field office director or his designee will make the determination that the frequency of arrival warrants relief from the registration requirements on a case-by-case basis, and will consider in this analysis the mode of travel, business and economic concerns, purpose of travel, or other factors as determined by the director. In making an application for relief, the alien must establish that good cause or exigent or unusual circumstances exist and that the alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exemption from registration. At a Department of State consular office abroad, an alien may seek exemption from these regulations from the Department of State by such methods as it may prescribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For all applications for relief. Any decision of a Department of Homeland Security officer or official to grant or deny relief under this paragraph (f)(7) is final and not appealable. Absent receipt of a decision exempting or relieving the nonimmigrant alien from these requirements, he or she shall comply with the special registration requirements contained in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Termination of relief. Relief granted under paragraphs (f)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section may be terminated by notice to the alien by any field office director or other Department of Homeland Security officer or official authorized to grant such relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Departure requirements. (i) General requirements When a nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration departs from the United States (other than nonimmigrant crewmen as defined under section 101(a)(15)(D) of the Act) he or she shall report to an inspecting officer of the Department of Homeland Security at any'port-of entry unless the Department of Homeland Security has, by publication of a notice in the Federal Register, specified that nonimmigrant aliens subject to special registration may not depart from specific ports. This paragraph (f)(8) applies only to those nonimmigrant aliens who have been registered under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or who have been required to register pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and who have not been granted relief from the departure requirements under paragraph (f)(7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General requirements When a nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration departs from the United States (other than nonimmigrant crewmen as defined under section 101(a)(15)(D) of the Act) he or she shall report to an inspecting officer of the Department of Homeland Security at any'port-of entry unless the Department of Homeland Security has, by publication of a notice in the Federal Register, specified that nonimmigrant aliens subject to special registration may not depart from specific ports. This paragraph (f)(8) applies only to those nonimmigrant aliens who have been registered under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or who have been required to register pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and who have not been granted relief from the departure requirements under paragraph (f)(7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Presumption of inadmissibility. Any nonimmigrant alien subject to special registration who fails, without good cause, to be examined by an inspecting officer at the time of his or her departure and to have his or her departure recorded by the inspecting officer shall thereafter be presumed to be inadmissible under, but not limited to, section 212(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(A)(ii)), as an alien whom the Secretary of Homeland Security has reasonable grounds to believe, based on the alien's past failure to conform with the requirements for special registration, seeks to enter the United States to engage in unlawful activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overcoming inadmissibility. An alien may overcome the presumption of inadmissibility set out in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) by making a showing that he or she satisfies conditions set by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State. If a consular officer, in adjudicating a new visa application by an alien that previously failed to register his or her departure from the United States, finds good cause existed for the alien's failure to register departure or that the alien is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, the inspecting officer at the port-of-entry, while not bound by the consular officer's decision, will consider this finding as a significantly favorable factor in determining whether the alien is admissible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Completion of registration. Registration under this paragraph (f) is not deemed to be complete unless all of the information required by the Department of Homeland Security and all requested documents are provided in a timely manner. Any additional re-registration that may be required and each change of material fact is a registration that is required under sections 262 and 263 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1302, 1303). Each change of address required under this paragraph (f) is a change of address required under section 265 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1305).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Registration and fingerprinting of children who reach age 14. Within 30 days after reaching the age of 14, any alien in the United States not exempt from alien registration under the Act and this chapter must apply for registration and fingerprinting, unless fingerprinting is waived under paragraph (e) of this section, in accordance with applicable form instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permanent residents. If such alien is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and is temporarily absent from the United States when he reaches the age of 14, he must apply for registration and provide a photograph within 30 days of his or her return to the United States in accordance with applicable form instructions. The alien, if a lawful permanent resident of

the United States, must surrender any prior evidence of alien registration. USCIS will issue the alien new evidence of alien registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Others. In the case of an alien who is not a lawful permanent resident, the alien's previously issued registration document will be noted to show that he or she has been registered and the date of registration.
