                                Sec. 180.207  Requirements for requalification of UN pressure
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) Each UN pressure receptacle used for the transportation of hazardous materials must conform to the requirements prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) in Sec. 180.205.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No pressure receptacle due for requalification may be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce unless that pressure receptacle has been successfully requalified and marked in accordance with this subpart. A pressure receptacle may be requalified at any time during or before the month and year that the requalification is due. However, a pressure receptacle filled before the requalification becomes due may remain in service until it is emptied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No person may requalify a UN composite pressure receptacle for continued use beyond its 15-years authorized service life. A pressure receptacle with a specified service life may not be refilled and offered for transportation after its authorized service life has expired unless approval has been obtained in writing from the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Periodic requalification of UN pressure receptacles. (1) Each pressure receptacle that is successfully requalified in accordance with the requirements specified in this section must be marked in accordance with Sec. 180.213. The requalification results must be recorded in accordance Sec. 180.215.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each pressure receptacle that fails requalification must be rejected or condemned in accordance with the applicable ISO requalification standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requalification interval. Each UN pressure receptacle that becomes due for periodic requalification must be requalified at the interval specified in the following table:</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Requalification Intervals of UN Pressure Receptacles------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Interval (years)       UN pressure receptacles/hazardous materials------------------------------------------------------------------------10.........................

Pressure receptacles used for adsorbed</p><p class="depth0">gases.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requalification procedures. Each UN pressure receptacle that becomes due for requalification must be requalified at the interval prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section and in accordance with the procedures contained in the following standard, as applicable. When a pressure test is performed on a UN pressure receptacle, the test must be a water jacket volumetric expansion test suitable for the determination of the cylinder expansion or a hydraulic proof pressure test. The test equipment must conform to the accuracy requirements in Sec. 180.205(g). Alternative methods (e.g., acoustic emission) or requalification procedures may be performed if prior approval has been obtained in writing from the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Seamless steel: Each seamless steel UN pressure receptacle, including MEGC's pressure receptacles, must be requalified in accordance with ISO 6406 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). However, UN cylinders with a tensile strength greater than or equal to 950 MPa must be requalified by ultrasonic examination in accordance with ISO 6406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seamless UN aluminum: Each seamless aluminum UN pressure receptacle must be requalified in accordance with ISO 10461 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dissolved acetylene UN cylinders: Each dissolved acetylene cylinder must be requalified in accordance with ISO 10462 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). The porous mass and the shell must be requalified no sooner than 3 years, 6 months, from the date of manufacture. Thereafter, subsequent requalifications of the porous mass and shell must be performed at least once every ten years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Composite UN cylinders: Each composite cylinder must be inspected and tested in accordance with ISO 11623 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> UN cylinders for adsorbed gases: Each UN cylinder for adsorbed gases must be inspected and tested in accordance with Sec. 173.302c and ISO 11513:2011 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).
