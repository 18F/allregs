                                Sec. 4287.158  Determination of loss and payment.

                            <p class="depth0">In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the lender after the collateral is liquidated, unless otherwise designated as a future recovery or after settlement and compromise of all parties has been completed. The Agency will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party which may be liable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Report of loss form. Form FmHA 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may only be approved by the Agency after the Agency has approved a liquidation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estimated loss. In accordance with the requirements of Sec. 4287.157(g) of this subpart, an estimated loss claim based on liquidation appraisal value will be prepared and submitted by the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estimated loss payment shall be applied as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency will

be applied by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. Such application does not release the borrower from liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An estimated loss will be applied first to reduce the principal balance on the guaranteed loan and the balance, if any, to accrued interest. Interest accrual on the defaulted loan will be discontinued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final report of loss payment, except in certain transfer and assumption situations as specified in Sec. 4287.134 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final loss. Within 30 days after liquidation of all collateral, except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section, is completed, a final report of loss must be prepared and submitted by the lender to the Agency. The Agency will not guarantee interest beyond this 30-day period other than for the period of time it takes the Agency to process the loss claim. Before approval by the Agency of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, the Agency may audit all applicable documentation to determine the final loss. The lender will make its records available and otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation. The documentation accompanying the report of loss must support the amounts shown on Form FmHA 449-30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A determination must be made regarding the collectibility of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees. If reasonably possible, such guarantees should be promptly collected or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Sec. 4287.157(k) of this subpart prior to completion of the final loss report. However, in the event that collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the report of loss will be filed when all other collateral has been liquidated, and unsecured personal or corporate guarantees will be treated as a future recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a pro rata basis by the lender and the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender must document that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly to the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender will show a breakdown of any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper and that payment was actually made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lender will show a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper and that payment was actually made. Liquidation expenses are recoverable only from collateral proceeds. Attorney fees may be approved as liquidation expenses provided the fees are reasonable and cover legal issues pertaining to the liquidation that could not be properly handled by the lender and its in-house counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Accrued interest will be supported by documentation as to how the amount was accrued. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender will include documentation of changes in both the selected base rate and the loan rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Loss payments will be paid by the Agency within 60 days after the review of the final loss report and accounting of the collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loss limit. The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits set forth in the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rent. Any net rental or other income that has been received by the lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Liquidation costs. Liquidation costs will be deducted from the proceeds of the disposition of primary collateral. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a substantial revision of liquidation costs, the lender will procure the Agency's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed. In-house expenses include, but are not limited to, employee's salaries, staff lawyers, travel, and overhead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment. When the Agency finds the final report of loss to be proper in all respects, it will approve Form FmHA 449-30 and proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, the Agency will pay the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the loss is less than the estimated loss payment, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Agency has conducted the liquidation, it will pay the lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.
