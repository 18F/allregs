                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The functions that will bring a particular position with a title other than president, vice-president, secretary-treasurer, or executive board member within the definition of ``officer'' cannot be precisely defined. They are the functions typically performed by officers holding these titles in current labor union practice. Decisions in each case will require a practical judgment. As a general rule, a person will be regarded as being authorized to perform the functions of president if he is the chief or principal executive officer of the labor organization. Similarly, he will be regarded as being authorized to perform the functions of treasurer if he

has principal responsibility for control and management of the organization's funds and fiscal operation. A member of any group, committee, or board which is vested with broad governing or policymaking authority will be regarded as a member of an ``executive board or similar governing body.'' The name or title that the labor organization assigns to the position is not controlling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of the election requirement of the Act is to assure that persons in positions of control in labor organizations will be responsive to the desires of the members. \18\ Professional and other staff members of the labor organization who do not determine the organization's policies or carry on its executive functions and who are employed merely to implement policy decisions and managerial directives established by the governing officials of the organization are not officers and are not required to be elected.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\18\ See, for example, S. Rept. 187, 86th Cong., 1st sess., p. 7.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
