After April 17, 2012, you are subject to the requirements in this subpart if you own or operate one or more polyvinyl chloride and copolymers process units (PVCPU), as defined in Sec. 63.12005, that are located at, or are part of, an area source of HAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On or before April 17, 2012, this subpart applies to each new or existing affected source.
