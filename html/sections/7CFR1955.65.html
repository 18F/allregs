                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> County Supervisor. The County Supervisor, with  the assistance of the District Director and State Office program staff  as necessary, will select the management method(s) used for property  which secures (or secured) loans to individuals as defined in this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State Director. The State Director will select the management  method to be used for property which secures (or secured) loans to  organizations as defined in this subpart. The State Director shall also  provide guidance and assistance to County Supervisors and District  Directors as necessary to insure that property under their jurisdiction  is effectively managed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Management methods. Management methods and requirements will  vary depending on such things as the number of properties involved,  their density of location, and market conditions. Management tools which  may be used effectively range from contracts to secure individual  property, have the grass cut, or winterize a dwelling; a simple  management contract to provide maintenance and other services on a group  of properties (including but not limited to specification writing,  inspection of repairs, and yard and directional signs and their  installation), or manage an MFH project; blanket-purchase arrangement  contracts to obtain services for more than one property; to a broad- scope management contract with a real estate broker or management agent  which may include inspection and specification-writing services, making  simple repairs, obtaining lessees, collecting rents, coordination with  listing brokers in marketing the properties and effecting eviction of  tenants when necessary. A contractor may handle evictions only where  State laws permit the contractor to do so in his/her own name; a  contractor may not pursue eviction in the name of the Government (FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354). Custodial property  may be managed in the same manner as inventory property except that it  may be leased only if it is habitable without repairs in excess of   those authorized in Sec. 1955.55(c) of this subpart. Farm or  organization property, such as rental housing and community facilities,  may be operated under a management contract if the State Director has  determined it is approporiate to have the property in operation. In any  case, the primary consideration in selecting the method of management to  be used is to protect the Government's interest. If property to be  operated or leased under a management contract is located in an area  identified by the Federal Insurance Administration as a special flood or  mudslide hazard area, lessees or tenants must be notified to that effect  in accordance with Sec. 1955.66(e) of this subpart. A management  contract which covers property in such a hazard area may provide for the  contractor to issue the required notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obtaining services for management and/or operation of  properties. Services for management, repair, and/or operation of  properties will be obtained by contract in accordance with FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A (available  in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Management contracts. Management contracts are flexible  instruments which may be tailored to meet the specific needs of almost  any situation involving custodial or inventory property. This type of  contract may be used to manage and maintain SFH properties, farms, and  any other type of facility for which FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 is responsible. Organization-type properties will be  secured, maintained, repaired, and operated if authorized, in accordance  with a management plan prepared by the District Director and approved by  the State Director if the amount of total debt does not exceed the State  Director's loan approval authority, or by the Administrator. For MFH  projects, tenant occupancy and selection will be in accordance with the  occupancy standards set forth in 7 CFR part 3560, subpart D. Tenants  will be required to sign a written lease if one does not exist when the  property is acquired or taken into custody. If a contract involves  management of an MFH project with 5 or more units, or 5 or more single- family dwellings located in the same subdivision, the contractor must  furnish Form HUD 935.2, ``Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan,''  subject to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  approval. Contracts for management of farm inventory property will be  offered on a competitive bid basis, giving preference to persons who  live in, and own and operate qualified small businesses in the area  where the property is located in accordance with the provisions in FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-Q  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  office).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authority to enter into management contracts. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The County  Supervisor may enter into a management contract for basic services  involving farms or not more than 25 single-family dwellings; however,  the aggregate amount paid under a contract may not exceed the  contracting authority limitation for County Supervisors outlined in FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  office).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A District Director may enter into a management contract for  basic maintenance and management services for an MFH project within the  contracting authority outlined in FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). The aggregate amount  of any contract may not exceed that contracting authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A CO in the State Office may enter into a management contract  for basic services involving more than 25 single-family dwellings, a  more complex management contract for SFH property, or an appropriate  contract for management or operation of farm or organization-type  property. The aggregate amount paid under a contract may not exceed the  contracting authority limitation for State Office staff outlined in FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A  (available in any   FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a proposed management contract will exceed the contracting  authority for State Office staff within a short time, a request for  contract action will be forwarded to the Administrator, to the attention  of the appropriate program division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specification of services. All management contracts will provide  for termination by either the contractor or the Government upon 30 days  written notice. Contracts providing for management of multiple  properties will also provide for properties to be added or removed from  the contractor's assignment whenever necessary, such as when a property  is acquired or taken into custody during the period of a contract or  when a property is sold from inventory. If a contractor prepares repair  specifications, that contractor will be excluded from the solicitation  for making the repairs to avoid a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth3">If a management contract calls for specification writing services, a  clause must be inserted in the contract prohibiting the preparer or his/ her associates from doing the repair work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Costs. Costs incurred with the management of property will be  paid according to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 office). For management of custodial property, costs  will be charged to the borrower's account as recoverable; and for  management of inventory property as nonrecoverable. Except for  management fees, costs of managing MFH inventory property when tenants  are still in residence will be paid to the extent possible with rental  income. Management fees will be paid to the manager in accordance with  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Office).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional management services. Additional types of management  services and supplies for which the State Director may authorize  acquisition include: Appraisal services (except for MFH), security  services, newspaper copy preparation services, market data and  comparable list acquisition, and tax data acquisition. If the State  Director believes there is a need to acquire other services not listed  in this paragraph or authorized elsewhere in this subpart, the State  Director should make a written request to the Assistant Administrator  (appropriate program) for consideration and/or authorization.
