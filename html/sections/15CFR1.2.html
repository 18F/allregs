                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act of February 14, 1903 (32 Stat. 825, as amended) (15 U.S.C. 1501), which established the Department of Commerce, provided that ``The said Secretary shall cause a seal of office to be made for the said department of such device as the President shall approve, and judicial notice shall be taken of the said seal.'' On April 4, 1913, the President approved and declared to be the seal of the Department of Commerce the device which he described as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Arms: Per fesse azure and or, a ship in full sail on waves of the sea, in chief proper; and in base a lighthouse illumined proper.</p><p class="depth2">Crest: The American Eagle displayed. Around the Arms, between two concentric circles, are the words:</p><p class="depth2">Department of Commerce</p><p class="depth2">United States of America</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The design of the approved seal is as shown below. Where necessitated by requirements of legibility, immediate comprehension, or clean reproduction, the concentric circles may be eliminated from the seal on publications and exhibits, and in slides, motion pictures, and television. In more formal uses of the seal, such as on letterheads, the full, proper rendition of the seal shall be used.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC20SE91.005</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The official symbolism of the seal shall be the following: The ship is a symbol of commerce; the blue denotes uprightness and constancy; the lighthouse is a well-known symbol representing guidance from the darkness which is translated to commercial enlightenment; and the gold denotes purity. The crest is the American bald eagle denoting the national scope of the Department's activities. (The above is a modification of the original symbolism issued with the President's approval of the seal, made necessary by
changes in the functions of the Department.)</p>
