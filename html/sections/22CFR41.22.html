An alien  entitled to classification under INA section 101(a)(15)(A) shall be  classified under this section even if eligible for another nonimmigrant  classification. An exception may be made where an immediate family  member classifiable as A-1 or A-2 under paragraph (a)(2) of this section  is also independently classifiable as a principal under INA section  101(a)(15)(G)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classification of attendants, servants, and personal employees.  An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(A)(iii)  if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under  those provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Referral to the Department of special cases concerning principal  alien applicants. In any case in which there is uncertainty about the  applicability of these regulations to a principal alien applicant  requesting such nonimmigrant status, the matter shall be immediately  referred to the Department for consideration as to whether acceptance of  accreditation will be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Change of classification to that of a foreign government  official. In the case of an alien in the United States seeking a change  of nonimmigrant classification under INA 248 to a classification under  INA 101(a)(15)(A) (i) or (ii), the question of acceptance of  accreditation is determined by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Termination of status. The Department may, in its discretion,  cease to recognize as entitled to classification under INA 101(a)(15)(A)  (i) or (ii) any alien who has nonimmigrant status under that provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Classification of foreign government official. A foreign  government official or employee seeking to enter the United States  temporarily other than as a representative or employee of a foreign  government is not classifiable under the provisions of INA  101(a)(15)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Courier and acting courier on official business--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Courier of  career. An alien regularly and professionally employed as a courier by  the government of the country to which the alien owes allegiance is  classifiable as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(A)(i), if the alien  is proceeding to the United States on official business for that  government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Official acting as courier. An alien not regularly and  professionally employed as a courier by the government of the country to  which the alien owes allegiance is classifiable as a nonimmigrant under  INA 101(a)(15)(A)(ii), if the alien is holding an official position and  is proceeding to the United States as a courier on official business for  that government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonofficial serving as courier. An alien serving as a courier  but not regularly and professionally employed as such who holds no  official position with, or is not a national of, the country whose  government the alien is serving, shall be classified as a nonimmigrant  under INA 101(a)(15)(B).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Official of foreign government not recognized by the United  States. An official of a foreign government not recognized de jure by  the United States, who is proceeding to or through the United States on  an official mission or to an international organization shall be  classified as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15) (B), (C), or (G)(iii).
