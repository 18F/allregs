                            <p class="depth0">The procedures described in this and subsequent sections will be the  test program to determine the conformity of engines with the standards  set forth in Sec. 86.084-11(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The test consists of a prescribed sequence of engine operating  conditions on an engine dynamometer with continuous examination of the  exhaust gases. The test is applicable equally to controlled engines  equipped with means for preventing, controlling, or eliminating smoke  emissions and to uncontrolled engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test is designed to determine the opacity of smoke in  exhaust emissions during those engine operating conditions which tend to  promote smoke from diesel vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The test procedure begins with a preconditioned engine which is  then run through preloading and preconditioning operations. After an  idling period, the engine is operated through acceleration and lugging  modes during which smoke emission measurements are made to compare with  the standards. The engine is then returned to the idle condition and the  acceleration and lugging modes are repeated. Three consecutive sequences  of acceleration and lugging constitutes the full set of operating  conditions for smoke emission measurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except in cases of component mulfunction or failure, all  emission control systems installed on, or incorporated in, a new motor  vehicle engine   shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be  authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.084-25.
