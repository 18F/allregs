                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section limits the amount of particulate matter that may be emitted from certain wood products industry sources operating within the Indian reservation to control ground-level concentrations of particulate matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any person who owns or operates any of the following wood products industry sources:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Veneer manufacturing operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plywood manufacturing operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Particleboard manufacturing operations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hardboard manufacturing operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What are the PM10 emission limits for wood products industry sources? These PM10 limits are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the particulate matter limits for combustion sources and process sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Veneer dryers at veneer manufacturing operations and plywood manufacturing operations. (i) PM10 emissions from direct natural gas fired or direct propane fired veneer dryers must not exceed 0.3 pounds per 1000 square feet of veneer dried (\3/8\ inch basis), one-hour average.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> PM10 emissions from direct natural gas fired or direct propane fired veneer dryers must not exceed 0.3 pounds per 1000 square feet of veneer dried (\3/8\ inch basis), one-hour average.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> PM10 emissions from steam heated veneer dryers must not exceed 0.3 pounds per 1000 square feet of veneer dried (\3/8\ inch basis), one-hour average.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> PM10 emissions from wood fired veneer dryers must not exceed a total of 0.3 pounds per 1000 square feet of veneer dried (\3/8\ inch basis) and 0.2 pounds per 1000 pounds of steam generated in boilers, prorated for the amount of combustion gases routed to the veneer dryer, one-hour average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wood particle dryers at particleboard manufacturing operation. PM10 emissions from wood particle dryers must not exceed a total of 0.4 pounds per 1000 square feet of board produced by the plant (\3/4\ inch basis), one-hour average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Press/cooling vents at hardboard manufacturing operations. PM10 emissions from hardboard press/cooling vents must not exceed 0.3 pounds per 1000 square feet of hardboard produced (\1/8\ inch basis), one-hour average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tempering ovens at hardboard manufacturing operations. A person must not operate any hardboard tempering oven unless all gases and vapors are collected and treated in a fume incinerator capable of raising the temperature of the gases and vapors to at least 1500 degrees Fahrenheit for 0.3 seconds or longer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What is the reference method for determining compliance? The reference method for determining compliance with the PM10 limits is EPA Method 202 in conjunction with Method 201A. A complete description of these methods is found in appendix M of 40 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section. The following terms that are used in this section are defined in Sec. 49.123 General provisions: Act, combustion source, emissions, hardboard, particleboard, particulate matter, plywood, PM10, PM2.5, press/cooling vent, process source, tempering oven, veneer, veneer dryer, wood, and wood-fired veneer dryer.</p>
