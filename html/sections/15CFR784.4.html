                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Complementary access notification. Complementary access will be  provided only upon the issuance of a written notice by BIS to the owner,  operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be accessed. If  BIS is unable to provide written notification to the owner, operator, or  agent in charge, BIS may post a notice prominently at the location to be  accessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Content of notice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pertinent information furnished by the  IAEA. The notice shall include all appropriate information provided by  the IAEA to the United States Government concerning:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The purpose of complementary access;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The basis for the selection of the location for complementary  access;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The activities that will be carried out during complementary  access;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The time and date that complementary access is expected to begin  and its anticipated duration; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The names and titles of the IAEA inspectors who will participate  in complementary access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Request for location's consent to complementary access. The  complementary access notification from BIS will request that the  location inform BIS whether or not it will consent to complementary  access. If a location does not agree to provide consent to complementary  access within four hours of its receipt of the complementary access  notification, BIS will seek an administrative warrant as provided in  Sec. 784.2(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Availability of advance team from BIS. An advance team from  BIS will be available to assist the location in preparing for  complementary access. If the complementary access is a 24-hour advance  notice, then the availability of an advance team may be limited. The  location requesting advance team assistance will not be required to  reimburse the U.S. Government for any costs associated with these  activities. The location (in cooperation with the advance team, if  available) will make preparations for complementary access, including  the identification of any ITAR-controlled technology and/or national  security information at the location (see Sec. 784.3(b)(3) of the APR).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notification procedures.
