When any of the above lines pass through a city, the city shall be considered to be located in Zone I.

Rico, Alaska, Hawaiian Islands and the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Zone III consists of that portion of the United States located south of a line, drawn on the United States Albers Equal Area Projection Map (based on standard parallels 29.50 and 45.50 North American datum), beginning at a point on the east coast of Georgia and the 31st parallel and ending at the United States-Mexican border, consisting of arcs drawn with a 241.4 kilometer (150 mile) radius to the north from the following specified points:
