Part 21 (32 CFR part 21) addresses deviation procedures and other general matters that relate to the DoDGARs, to DoD Components' authorities and responsibilities for assistance instruments, and to requirements for reporting information about assistance awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Two additional parts of the DoDGARs apply to TIAs, although they do not mention TIAs explicitly. They are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Part 1125 (2 CFR part 1125) on nonprocurement debarment and suspension, which applies because it covers nonprocurement instruments in general;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Part 26 (32 CFR part 26), on drug-free workplace requirements, which applies because it covers financial assistance in general; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Part 28 (32 CFR part 28), on lobbying restrictions, which applies by law (31 U.S.C. 1352) to TIAs that are cooperative agreements and as a matter of DoD policy to all other TIAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Portions of four other DoDGARs parts apply to TIAs only as cited by reference in this part. Those parts of

the DoDGARs are parts 22, 32, 33, and 34 (32 CFR parts 22, 32, 33, and 34).
