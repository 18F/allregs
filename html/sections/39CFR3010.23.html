                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. In this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Current rate--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the term current rate means the rate in effect when the Postal Service files the notice of rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the term current rate means the rate in effect when the Postal Service files the notice of rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Seasonal and temporary rates. When used with respect to a seasonal or temporary rate, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the term current rate means the most recent rate in effect for the rate cell, regardless of whether the seasonal or temporary rate is available at the time the Postal Service files the notice of rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exception. When used with respect to a rate cell that corresponds to a rate incentive that was previously excluded from the calculation of the percentage change in rates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the term current rate means the full undiscounted rate in effect for the rate cell at the time of the filing of the notice of rate adjustment, not the discounted rate in effect for the rate cell at such time. For example, if a rate incentive provides a 5-cent discount on a 25-cent rate and the Postal Service previously elected to exclude the rate incentive from the calculation of the percentage change in rates, the Postal Service may choose to begin including the discounted rate in its calculation of the percentage change in rates. If the Postal Service makes that choice, the current rate for the discounted rate cell will be 25 cents (the full undiscounted rate).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rate cell. The term rate cell means each and every separate rate identified in any applicable notice of rate adjustment for rates of general applicability. A seasonal or temporary rate shall be identified and treated as a rate cell separate and distinct from the corresponding non-seasonal or permanent rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rate incentive means a discount that is not a workshare discount and that is designed to increase or retain volume, improve the value of mail for mailers, or improve the operations of the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation--(1) Type 1-A and Type 1-B rate adjustments. For a Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated in three steps. First, the volume of each rate cell in the class is multiplied by the planned rate for the respective cell and the resulting products are summed. Then, the same set of rate cell volumes are multiplied by the corresponding current rate for each cell and the resulting products are summed. Finally, the percentage change in rates is calculated by dividing the results of the first step by the results of the second step and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The result is expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Type 1-A and Type 1-B rate adjustments. For a Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated in three steps. First, the volume of each rate cell in the class is multiplied by the planned rate for the respective cell and the resulting products are summed. Then, the same set of rate cell volumes are multiplied by the corresponding current rate for each cell and the resulting products are summed. Finally, the percentage change in rates is calculated by dividing the results of the first step by the results of the second step and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The result is expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Type 1-C rate adjustments. For a Type 1-C rate adjustment, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated by amending the workpapers attached to the Commission's order relating to the most recent Type 1-A or Type 1-B notice of rate adjustment to replace the planned rates under the most recent Type 1-A or Type 1-B notice of rate adjustment with the corresponding planned rates applicable to the class from the Type 1-C notice of rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formula. The formula for calculating the percentage change in rates for a class described in paragraph (b) of this section is as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Percentage change in rates =</p><p class="depth2">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JN14.000</p><p class="depth2">Where,
N = number of rate cells in the classi = denotes a rate cell (i = 1, 2, . . . , N)Ri,n = planned rate of rate cell iRi,c = current rate of rate cell i (for a Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate</p><p class="depth2">adjustment) or rate from most recent Type 1-A rate adjustment</p><p class="depth2">for rate cell i (for a Type 1-C rate adjustment)Vi = volume of rate cell i</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Volumes--(1) Obtaining Volumes from billing determinants. The volumes for each rate cell shall be obtained from the most recent available 12 months of Postal Service billing determinants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtaining Volumes from billing determinants. The volumes for each rate cell shall be obtained from the most recent available 12 months of Postal Service billing determinants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permissible adjustments. The Postal Service shall make reasonable adjustments to the billing determinants to account for the effects of classification changes such as the introduction, deletion, or redefinition of rate cells. The Postal Service shall identify and explain all adjustments. All information and calculations relied upon to develop the adjustments shall be provided together with an explanation of why the adjustments are appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Basis for adjustments. Whenever possible, adjustments shall be based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data, as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustment for deletion of rate cell when alternate rate cell is not available. For an adjustment accounting for the effects of the deletion of a rate cell when an alternate rate cell is not available, the Postal Service should adjust the billing determinants associated with the rate cell to zero. If the Postal Service does not adjust the billing determinants for the rate cell to zero, the Postal Service shall include a rationale for its treatment of the rate cell with the information required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of rate incentives. (1) Rate incentives may be excluded from a percentage change in rates calculation. If the Postal Service elects to exclude a rate incentive from a percentage change in rates calculation, the rate incentive shall be treated in the same manner as a rate under a negotiated service agreement (as described in Sec. 3010.24).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rate incentives may be excluded from a percentage change in rates calculation. If the Postal Service elects to exclude a rate incentive from a percentage change in rates calculation, the rate incentive shall be treated in the same manner as a rate under a negotiated service agreement (as described in Sec. 3010.24).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A rate incentive may be included in a percentage change in rates calculation if it meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rate incentive is in the form of a discount or can be easily translated into a discount;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sufficient billing determinants are available for the rate incentive to be included in the percentage change in rate calculation for the class, which may be adjusted based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data (as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The rate incentive is a rate of general applicability.
