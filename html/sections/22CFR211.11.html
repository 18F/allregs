                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination or suspension by A.I.D. All or any part of the assistance provided under the program, including commodities in transit, may be terminated or suspended by A.I.D. at its discretion if AID/W determines that a cooperating sponsor has failed to comply with the provisions of the approved Operational Plan or TA, or of this Regulation, or that the continuation of such assistance is no longer necessary or desirable. If AID/W believes that circumstances permit, AID/W will provide a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor written notice of A.I.D.'s intention to terminate or suspend the cooperating sponsor's program, together with an explanation of the reason(s) for A.I.D.'s action, at least 30 days prior to

the date indicated in the notice that the program will be terminated or suspended. Comments provided by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor prior to the effective date of the termination or suspension shall be considered by AID/W in determining whether to rescind the notice. When a program is terminated or suspended, title to commodities which have been transferred to the cooperating sponsor, or monetized proceeds, program income and real or personal property procured with monetized proceeds or program income shall, at the written request of USAID, the Diplomatic Post or AID/W, be transferred to the U.S. Government by the cooperating sponsor or shall otherwise be transferred by the cooperating sponsor as directed by A.I.D. Any then excess commodities on hand at the time the program is terminated shall be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 211.5 (o) and (p) or as otherwise instructed by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. If it is determined that any commodity authorized to be supplied under the Operational Plan or TA is no longer available for Food for Peace programs, such authorization shall terminate with respect to any commodities which, as of the date of such determination have not been delivered f.o.b. or f.a.s. vessel, provided that every effort will be made to give adequate advance notice to protect cooperating sponsors against unnecessarily booking vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expiration of program. Upon expiration of the approved program under circumstances other than those described in paragraph (a), the cooperating sponsor shall deposit with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to CCC Account No. 20FT401, any remaining monetized proceeds or program income, or the cooperating sponsor shall obtain approval from AID/W for the use of such monetized proceeds or program income, or real or personal property procured with such proceeds or income, for purposes consistent with those authorized for support from A.I.D.</p>
