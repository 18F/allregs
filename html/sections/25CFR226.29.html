                            <p class="depth0">Leases or any interest therein may be assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Superintendent. The assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under existing rules and regulations and furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The lessee must assign either his/her entire interest in a lease or legal subdivision thereof, or an undivided interest in the whole lease: Provided, however, that the Superintendent may approve an assignment that covers only a portion of a lease with the consent of the Osage Minerals Council. Approval by the Superintendent of a lease assignment or transfer of an interest in a lease or legal subdivision, is subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the Superintendent approves the assignment or transfer, the lessee who made the assignment will continue to be responsible, jointly and severally with the assignee, for lease obligations that accrued before the approval date, whether or not they were identified at the time of the assignment or transfer. This includes paying compensatory royalties for drainage. It also includes responsibility for plugging wells and abandoning facilities that were drilled, installed, or used before the effective date of the assignment or transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assignee agrees to comply with the terms of the original lease as

it applies to the rights that were acquired. Among other obligations, the assignee must plug and abandon all unplugged wells, reclaim the lease site, and remedy all environmental problems in existence that a purchaser exercising reasonable diligence should have known at the time of the transfer. The assignee must also maintain a bond in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a lease is divided by the assignment of an entire interest in any part, each part will become a separate lease and the assignee is bound to comply with all the terms and conditions of the original lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A fully executed copy of the assignment must be filed with the Superintendent within 30 calendar days after the date of execution by all parties. If requested within the 30-day period, the Superintendent may grant an extension of 15 calendar days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A filing fee of $75 must accompany each assignment.</p>
