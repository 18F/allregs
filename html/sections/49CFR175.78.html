                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For stowage on an aircraft, in a cargo facility, or in any other  area at an airport designated for the stowage of hazardous materials,  packages containing hazardous materials which might react dangerously  with one another may not be placed next to each other or in a position  that would allow a dangerous interaction in the event of leakage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At a minimum, the segregation instructions prescribed in the  following Segregation Table must be followed to maintain acceptable  segregation between packages containing hazardous materials with  different hazards. The Segregation Table instructions apply whether or  not the class or division is the primary or subsidiary risk. The  Segregation Table follows:</p><p class="depth2">Segregation Table ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Class or division</p><p class="depth2">Hazard label           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">1         2         3        4.2       4.3       5.1       5.2        8 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1...............................

Only certain Division 1.3,  Compatibility Groups C and G, and Division 1.4, Compatibility Groups B,  C, D, E, G and S, explosives may be transported aboard a cargo aircraft.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Division 1.4 explosives in Compatibility Group S may be stowed  with Division 1.3 and 1.4 explosives in compatibility groups as  permitted aboard aircraft under paragraph (c)(4)(i) above.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except for Division 1.4B explosives and as otherwise provided  in this Note, explosives of different compatibility groups may be stowed  together whether or not they belong to the same division. Division 1.4B  explosives must not be stowed together with any other explosive  permitted aboard aircraft except Division 1.4S, unless segregated as  prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section (``Note 1'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Division 1.4B and Division 1.3 explosives may not be stowed  together. Division 1.4B explosives must be loaded into separate unit  load devices and, when stowed aboard the aircraft, the unit load devices  must be separated by other cargo with a minimum separation of 2 m (6.5  feet). When not loaded in unit load devices, Division 1.4B and Division  1.3 explosives must be loaded into different, non-adjacent loading  positions and separated by other cargo with a minimum separation of 2 m  (6.5 feet).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Note 2. ``Note 2'' at the intersection of a row and column means  that other than explosives of Division 1.4, Compatibility Group S,  explosives may not be stowed together with that class.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Packages containing hazardous materials with multiple hazards in  the class or divisions, which require segregation in accordance with the  Segregation Table, need not be segregated from other packages bearing  the same UN number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A package labeled ``BLASTING AGENT'' may not be stowed next to  or in a position that will allow contact with a package of special  fireworks or railway torpedoes.
