Investments that do not  satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 652.20 at the time of  purchase are ineligible. You must not purchase ineligible investments.  If you determine that you have purchased an ineligible investment, you  must notify the OSMO within 15 calendar days after such determination.  You must divest of the investment no later than 60 calendar days after  the determination unless we approve, in writing, a plan that authorizes  you to divest of the investment over a longer period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investments that no longer satisfy eligibility criteria. If you  determine that an investment (that satisfied the eligibility criteria  set forth in Sec. 652.20 when purchased) no longer satisfies the  eligibility criteria, you must notify the OSMO within 15 calendar days  of the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for investments that are ineligible or no longer  satisfy eligibility criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reporting requirements. Each quarter,  you must report to the OSMO and your board on the status of investments  identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Your report must  demonstrate the effect that these investments may have on the  Corporation's capital, earnings, and liquidity position. Additionally,  the report must address how the Corporation plans to reduce its risk  exposure from these investments or exit the position(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other requirements. Investments identified in paragraph (a) or  (b) of this section may not be used to satisfy the liquidity  requirement(s) in Sec. 652.40. These investments must continue to be  included in the investment portfolio limit calculation established in  Sec. 652.15(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reservation of authority. FCA retains the authority to require  you to divest of any investment at any time for failure to comply with  Sec. 652.15(a) or for safety and soundness reasons. The timeframe set by  FCA for such required divestiture will consider the expected loss on the  transaction (or transactions) and the effect on the Corporation's  financial condition and performance.</p>
