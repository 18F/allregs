                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Suspension. NASA or the recipient may suspend the cooperative agreement for a mutually agreeable period of time, if an assessment is required to determine whether the agreement should be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Termination. (1) A cooperative agreement provides both NASA and the recipient the ability to terminate the Agreement if it is in their best interests to do so, by giving the other party prior written notice. Upon receipt of a notice of termination, the receiving party shall take immediate steps to stop the accrual of any additional obligations, which might require payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NASA may, for example, terminate the Agreement if the recipient is not making anticipated technical progress, if the recipient materially changes the objectives of the agreement, or if appropriated funds are not available to support the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Similarly, the recipient may terminate the agreement if, for example, technical progress is not being made, if the commercial recipient shifts its technical emphasis, or if other technological advances have made the effort obsolete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the cooperative agreement is terminated by either NASA or the recipient and NASA elects to continue the project with a party other than the recipient, the right of the government to use data first produced by either NASA or the recipient in the performance of this agreement is covered by 1274.905(b). See Sec. 1274.208(l)(6) to assure that appropriate language is contained in Sec. 1274.905(b).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 1274.8_Post-Award/Administrative Requirements</p>
