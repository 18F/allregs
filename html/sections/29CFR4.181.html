                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fair Labor Standards Act. Although provision has not been made  for insertion in Government contracts of stipulations requiring  compliance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  contractors and subcontractors performing contracts subject to the  McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act may be required to compensate their  employees working on or in connection with such contracts for overtime  work pursuant to the overtime pay standards of the Fair Labor Standards  Act. This is true with respect to employees engaged in interstate or  foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce  (including occupations and processes closely related and directly  essential to such production) and employees employed in enterprises  which are so engaged, subject to the definitions and exceptions provided  in such Act. Such employees, except as otherwise specifically provided  in such Act, must receive overtime compensation at a rate of not less  than 1\1/2\ times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in  excess of the applicable standard in a workweek. See part 778 of this  title. However, the Fair Labor Standards Act provides no overtime pay  requirements for employees, not within such interstate commerce coverage  of the Act, who are subject to its minimum wage provisions only by  virtue of the provisions of section 6(e), as explained in Sec. 4.180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contract  Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-332) applies  generally to   Government contracts, including service contracts in excess of $100,000,  which may require or involve the employment of laborers and mechanics.  Guards, watchmen, and many other classes of service employees are  laborers or mechanics within the meaning of such Act. However, employees  rendering only professional services, seamen, and as a general rule  those whose work is only clerical or supervisory or nonmanual in nature,  are not deemed laborers or mechanics for purposes of the Act. The wages  of every laborer and mechanic for performance of work on such contracts  must include compensation at a rate not less than 1\1/2\ times the  employees' basic rate of pay for all hours worked in any workweek in  excess of 40. Exemptions are provided for certain transportation and  communications contracts, contracts for the purchase of supplies  ordinarily available in the open market, and work, required to be done  in accordance with the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulations concerning this Act are contained in 29 CFR part 5  which permit overtime pay to be computed in the same manner as under the  Fair Labor Standards Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. As pointed out in Sec.  4.117, while some Government contracts may be subject both to the  McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act and to the Walsh-Healey Public  Contracts Act, the employees performing work on the contract which is  subject to the latter Act are, when so engaged, exempt from the  provisions of the former. They are, however, subject to the overtime  provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act if, in any workweek, any of the work  performed for the employer is subject to such Act and if, in such  workweek, the total hours worked by the employee for the employer  (whether wholly or only partly on such work) exceed 40 hours in the  workweek. In any such workweek the Walsh-Healey Act requires payment of  overtime compensation at a rate not less than 1\1/2\ times the  employee's basic rate for such weekly overtime hours. The overtime pay  provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act are discussed in greater detail in 41  CFR part 50-201.  [48 FR 49762, Oct. 27, 1983, as amended at 51 FR 12265, Apr. 9, 1986; 61  FR 40716, Aug. 5, 1996]</p>
