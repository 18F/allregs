                                Sec. 1.707-1  Transactions between partner and partnership.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Partner not acting in capacity as partner. A partner who engages  in a transaction with a partnership other than in his capacity as a  partner shall be treated as if he were not a member of the partnership  with respect to such transaction. Such transactions include, for  example, loans of money or property by the partnership to the partner or  by the partner to the partnership, the sale of property by the partner  to the partnership, the purchase of property by the partner from the  partnership, and the rendering of services by the partnership to the  partner or by the partner to the partnership. Where a partner retains  the ownership of property but allows the partnership to use such  separately owned property for partnership purposes (for example, to  obtain credit or to secure firm creditors by guaranty, pledge, or other  agreement) the transaction is treated as one between a partnership and a  partner not acting in his capacity as a partner. However, transfers of  money or property by a partner to a partnership as contributions, or  transfers of money or property by a partnership to a partner as  distributions, are not transactions included within the provisions of  this section. In all cases, the substance of the transaction will govern  rather than its form. See paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.731-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certain sales or exchanges of property with respect to  controlled partnerships--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Losses disallowed. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No deduction shall  be allowed for a loss on a sale or exchange of property (other than an  interest in the partnership, directly or indirectly, between a  partnership and a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50  percent of the capital interest or profits interest in such partnership.  A loss on a sale or exchange of property, directly or indirectly,  between two partnerships in which the same persons own, directly or  indirectly, more than 50 percent of the capital interest or profits  interest in each partnership shall not be allowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a gain is realized upon the subsequent sale or exchange by a  transferee of property with respect to which a loss was disallowed under  the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, section 267(d)  (relating to amount of gain where loss previously disallowed) shall  apply as though the loss were disallowed under section 267(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gains treated as ordinary income. Any gain recognized upon the  sale or exchange, directly or indirectly, of property which, in the  hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer, is property  other than a capital asset, as defined in section 1221, shall be  ordinary income if the transaction is between a partnership and a  partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 80 percent of the  capital interest or profits interest in the partnership. This rule also  applies where such a transaction is between partnerships in which the  same persons own, directly or indirectly, more than 80 percent of the  capital interest or profits interest in each partnership. The term  property other than a capital asset includes (but is not limited to)  trade accounts receivable, inventory, stock in trade, and depreciable or  real property used in the trade or business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ownership of a capital or profits interest. In determining the  extent of the ownership by a partner, as defined in section 761(b), of  his capital interest or profits interest in a partnership, the rules for  constructive ownership of stock provided in section 267(c) (1), (2),  (4), and (5) shall be applied for the purpose of section 707(b) and this  paragraph. Under these rules, ownership of a capital or profits interest  in a partnership may be attributed to a person who is not a partner as  defined in section 761(b) in order that another partner may be  considered the constructive owner of such interest under section 267(c).  However, section 707(b)(1)(A) does not apply to a constructive owner of  a partnership interest since he is not a partner as defined in section  761(b). For example, where trust T is a partner in the partnership ABT,  and AW, A's wife, is the sole beneficiary of the trust, the ownership of  a capital and profits interest in the partnership by T will be  attributed to AW only for the purpose of further attributing the  ownership of such interest to A. See section 267(c) (1) and (5). If A,  B, and T are   equal partners, then A will be considered as owning more than 50 percent  of the capital and profits interest in the partnership, and losses on  transactions between him and the partnership will be disallowed by  section 707(b)(1)(A). However, a loss sustained by AW on a sale or  exchange of property with the partnership would not be disallowed by  section 707, but will be disallowed to the extent provided in paragraph  (b) of Sec. 1.267(b)-1. See section 267 (a) and (b), and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guaranteed payments. Payments made by a partnership to a partner  for services or for the use of capital are considered as made to a  person who is not a partner, to the extent such payments are determined  without regard to the income of the partnership. However, a partner must  include such payments as ordinary income for his taxable year within or  with which ends the partnership taxable year in which the partnership  deducted such payments as paid or accrued under its method of  accounting. See section 706(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.706-1.  Guaranteed payments are considered as made to one who is not a member of  the partnership only for the purposes of section 61(a) (relating to  gross income) and section 162(a) (relating to trade or business  expenses). For a guaranteed payment to be a partnership deduction, it  must meet the same tests under section 162(a) as it would if the payment  had been made to a person who is not a member of the partnership, and  the rules of section 263 (relating to capital expenditures) must be  taken into account. This rule does not affect the deductibility to the  partnership of a payment described in section 736(a)(2) to a retiring  partner or to a deceased partner's successor in interest. Guaranteed  payments do not constitute an interest in partnership profits for  purposes of sections 706(b)(3), 707(b), and 708(b). For the purposes of  other provisions of the internal revenue laws, guaranteed payments are  regarded as a partner's distributive share of ordinary income. Thus, a  partner who receives guaranteed payments for a period during which he is  absent from work because of personal injuries or sickness is not  entitled to exclude such payments from his gross income under section  105(d). Similarly, a partner who receives guaranteed payments is not  regarded as an employee of the partnership for the purposes of  withholding of tax at source, deferred compensation plans, etc. The  provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Under the ABC partnership agreement, partner A is  entitled to a fixed annual payment of $10,000 for services, without  regard to the income of the partnership. His distributive share is 10  percent. After deducting the guaranteed payment, the partnership has  $50,000 ordinary income. A must include $15,000 as ordinary income for  his taxable year within or with which the partnership taxable year ends  ($10,000 guaranteed payment plus $5,000 distributive share).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Partner C in the CD partnership is to receive 30 percent  of partnership income as determined before taking into account any  guaranteed payments, but not less than $10,000. The income of the  partnership is $60,000, and C is entitled to $18,000 (30 percent of  $60,000) as his distributive share. No part of this amount is a  guaranteed payment. However, if the partnership had income of $20,000  instead of $60,000, $6,000 (30 percent of $20,000) would be partner C's  distributive share, and the remaining $4,000 payable to C would be a  guaranteed payment.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Partner X in the XY partnership is to receive a payment  of $10,000 for services, plus 30 percent of the taxable income or loss  of the partnership. After deducting the payment of $10,000 to partner X,  the XY partnership has a loss of $9,000. Of this amount, $2,700 (30  percent of the loss) is X's distributive share of partnership loss and,  subject to section 704(d), is to be taken into account by him in his  return. In addition, he must report as ordinary income the guaranteed  payment of $10,000 made to him by the partnership.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3 of this paragraph,  except that, instead of a $9,000 loss, the partnership has $30,000 in  capital gains and no other items of income or deduction except the  $10,000 paid X as a guaranteed payment. Since the items of partnership  income or loss must be segregated under section 702(a), the partnership  has a $10,000 ordinary loss and $30,000 in capital gains. X's 30 percent  distributive shares of these amounts are $3,000 ordinary loss and $9,000  capital gain. In addition, X has received a $10,000 guaranteed payment  which is ordinary income to him.
