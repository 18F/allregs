                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Beeswax (CAS Reg. No. 8012-89-3) is a secretory product of honey  bees used as a structural material in honeycombs. Beeswax is prepared  from honeycombs after removal of the honey by draining or centrifuging.  The combs are melted in hot water or steam or with solar heat, and  strained. The wax is refined by melting in hot water to which sulfuric  acid or alkali may be added to extract impurities. The resulting wax is  referred to as yellow beeswax. White beeswax is produced by bleaching  the constituent pigments of   yellow beeswax with peroxides, or preferably it is bleached by sun  light.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the ``Food Chemicals  Codex,'' 3d Ed. (1981), pp. 34-35, which is incorporated by reference.  Copies may be obtained from the National Academy Press, 2101  Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20418, or may be examined at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Current good manufacturing practice results in a  maximum level, as served, of: 0.065 percent for chewing gum as defined  in Sec. 170.3(n)(6) of this chapter; 0.005 percent for confections and  frostings as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(9) of this chapter; 0.04 percent  for hard candy as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(25) of this chapter; 0.1  percent for soft candy as defined in Sec. 170.3(n)(38) of this chapter;  and 0.002 percent or less for all other food categories.
