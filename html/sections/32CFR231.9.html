Equipment generally is activated by a plastic card in combination with a personal identification number (PIN). Typically, when the cardholder's account is with a financial

institution other than that operating the ATM, its use results in the assessment of a fee from the ATM network (e.g., Armed Forces Financial Network (AFFN), Cirrus, or PLUS) that processes the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Banking institution. An entity chartered by a state or the federal government to provide financial services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Banking office.

Examples of circumstances that may affect fair market rental include limitations of usage and access to the financial institution by persons other than those on the installation, proximity to the community center or installation business district, and the government's right to terminate the lease or take title to improvements constructed at the financial institution's expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Field of membership. A group of people entitled to credit union membership because of a common bond of occupation, association, employment, or residence within a well-defined neighborhood, community, rural district, and other persons sharing a common bond as described by credit union board of directors policy or by Interpretation Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 99-1.
