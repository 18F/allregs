                            <p class="depth0">BIS may impose foreign policy export, reexport, and transfer (in- country) license requirements, limitations on availability of license  exceptions, and set license application review policy based on the  criteria in this section. Such requirements, limitations and policy are  in addition to those set forth elsewhere in the EAR. License  requirements, limitations on use of license exceptions and license  application review policy will be imposed under this section by adding  an entity to the Entity List (Supp. No. 4 to this part) with a reference  to this section and by stating on the Entity List the license  requirements and license application review policy that apply to that  entity. BIS may remove an entity from the Entity List if it is no longer  engaged in the activities described in paragraph (b) of this section and  is unlikely to engage in such activities in the future. BIS may modify  the license exception limitations and license application review policy  that applies to a particular entity to implement the policies of this  section. BIS will implement the provisions of this section in accordance  with the decisions of the End-User Review Committee or, if appropriate  in a particular case, in accordance with the decisions of the body to  which the End-User Review Committee decision is escalated. The End-User  Review Committee will follow the procedures set forth in Supplement No.  5 to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License requirement, availability of license exceptions, and  license application review policy. A license is required, to the extent  specified on the Entity List, to export, reexport, or transfer (in- country) any item subject to the EAR to an entity that is listed on the  Entity List in an entry that contains a reference to this section.  License exceptions may not be used unless authorized in that entry.  Applications for licenses required by this section will be evaluated as  stated in that entry in addition to any other applicable review policy  stated elsewhere in the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for revising the Entity List. Entities for which there  is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts,  that the entity has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant  risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to  the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States  and those acting on behalf of such entities may be added to the Entity  List pursuant to this section. This section may not be used to place on  the Entity List any party to which exports or reexports require a  license pursuant to Sec. 744.12, Sec. 744.13, Sec. 744.14 or Sec.  744.18 of this part. This section may not be used to place on the Entity  List any party if exports or reexports to that party of items that are  subject to the EAR are prohibited by or require a license from   another U.S. government agency. This section may not be used to place  any U.S. person, as defined in Sec. 772.1 of the EAR, on the Entity  List. Examples (1) through (5) of this paragraph provide an illustrative  list of activities that could be contrary to the national security or  foreign policy interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supporting persons engaged in acts of terror.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actions that could enhance the military capability of, or the  ability to support terrorism of governments that have been designated by  the Secretary of State as having repeatedly provided support for acts of  international terrorism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transferring, developing, servicing, repairing or producing  conventional weapons in a manner that is contrary to United States  national security or foreign policy interests or enabling such transfer,  service, repair, development, or production by supplying parts,  components, technology, or financing for such activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Preventing accomplishment of an end use check conducted by or on  behalf of BIS or the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the  Department of State by: precluding access to; refusing to provide  information about; or providing false or misleading information about  parties to the transaction or the item to be checked. The conduct in  this example includes: expressly refusing to permit a check, providing  false or misleading information, or engaging in dilatory or evasive  conduct that effectively prevents the check from occurring or makes the  check inaccurate or useless. A nexus between the conduct of the party to  be listed and the failure to produce a complete, accurate and useful  check is required, even though an express refusal by the party to be  listed is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Engaging in conduct that poses a risk of violating the EAR when  such conduct raises sufficient concern that the End-User Review  committee believes that prior review of exports, reexports, or transfers  (in-country) involving the party and the possible imposition of license  conditions or license denial enhances BIS's ability to prevent  violations of the EAR.
