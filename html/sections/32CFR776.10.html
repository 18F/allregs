                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Advisors. Covered attorneys may seek informal ethics advice either from the officers named below or from supervisory attorneys in the field. Within the Office of the JAG and HQMC, the following officials are designated to respond, either orally or in writing, to informal inquiries concerning this part in the areas of practice indicated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Head, Military Affairs/Personnel Law Branch, Administrative Law Division: administrative boards and related matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deputy Director, Criminal Law Division: military justice matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Director, Legal Assistance Division: legal assistance matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Deputy Director, JA Division, HQMC: cases involving Marine Corps judge advocates, or civil service and contracted civilian attorneys who perform legal services under the cognizance and supervision of Director, JA Division, HQMC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Head, Standards of Conduct/Government Ethics Branch, Administrative Law Division: all other matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation. Informal ethics advice will not normally be provided by JAG/HQMC advisors concerning professional responsibility matters (e.g., ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct) that are then the subject of litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written advice. A request for informal advice does not relieve the requester of the obligation to comply with subpart B of this part. Although covered attorneys are encouraged to seek advice when in doubt as to their responsibilities, they remain personally accountable for their professional conduct. If, however, an attorney receives written advice on an ethical matter after full disclosure of all relevant facts and reasonably relies on such advice, no adverse action under

this part will be taken against the attorney. Written advice may be sought from either a supervisory attorney or the appropriate advisor in paragraph (a) of this section. JAG is not bound by unwritten advice or by advice provided by personnel who are not supervisory attorneys or advisors. See Sec. 776.54 of this part.</p>
