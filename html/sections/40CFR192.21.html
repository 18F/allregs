                            <p class="depth0">Unless otherwise indicated in this subpart, all terms shall have the  same meaning as defined in Title I of the Act or in subparts A and B.  The implementing agencies may (and in the case of paragraph (h) of this  section shall) apply standards under Sec. 192.22 in lieu of the  standards of subparts A or B if they determine that any of the following  circumstances exists:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedial actions required to satisfy subpart A or B would pose a  clear and present risk of injury to workers or to members of the public,  notwithstanding reasonable measures to avoid or reduce risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>  and (c), would, notwithstanding reasonable measures to limit damage,  directly produce health and environmental harm that is clearly excessive  compared to the health and environmental benefits, now or in the future.  A clear excess of health and environmental harm is harm that is long- term, manifest, and grossly disproportionate to health and environmental  benefits that may reasonably be anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The estimated cost of remedial action to satisfy Sec. 192.12(a)  at a ``vicinity'' site (described under section 101(6)(B) of the Act) is  unreasonably high relative to the long-term benefits, and the residual  radioactive materials do not pose a clear present or future hazard. The  likelihood that buildings will be erected or that people will spend long  periods of time at such a vicinity site should be considered in  evaluating this hazard. Remedial action will generally not be necessary  where residual radioactive materials have been placed semi-permanently  in a location where site-specific factors limit their hazard and from  which they are costly or difficult to remove, or   where only minor quantities of residual radioactive materials are  involved. Examples are residual radioactive materials under hard surface  public roads and sidewalks, around public sewer lines, or in fence post  foundations. Supplemental standards should not be applied at such sites,  however, if individuals are likely to be exposed for long periods of  time to radiation from such materials at levels above those that would  prevail under Sec. 192.12(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The cost of a remedial action for cleanup of a building under  Sec. 192.12(b) is clearly unreasonably high relative to the benefits.  Factors that should be included in this judgment are the anticipated  period of occupancy, the incremental radiation level that would be  affected by the remedial action, the residual useful lifetime of the  building, the potential for future construction at the site, and the  applicability of less costly remedial methods than removal of residual  radioactive materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There is no known remedial action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The restoration of groundwater quality at any designated  processing site under Sec. 192.12(c) is technically impracticable from  an engineering perspective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The groundwater meets the criteria of Sec. 192.11(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Radionuclides other than radium-226 and its decay products are  present in sufficient quantity and concentration to constitute a  significant radiation hazard from residual radioactive materials.
