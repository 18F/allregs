If an  exemption from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act is effective  pursuant to section 1(c), the exempted person shall be responsible for  calling to the attention of the State Commission by which it is  regulated and of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission any future  operations in which it may engage which may make the exemption  inapplicable to it. The exempted person shall also be responsible for  calling to the attention of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission any  changes, amendment, or judicial or administrative interpretation of the  State law pursuant to which it is regulated, which may make the  exemption inapplicable to it.
