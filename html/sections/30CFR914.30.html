                            <p class="depth0">State-Federal Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">The Governor of the State of Indiana (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies</p><p class="depth0">A. Authority</p><p class="depth0">This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for the State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations (including surface operations and surface impacts incident to underground mining operations) on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3400 and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Indiana on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and State and Federal laws governing such activities and the Indiana State Program (Program).</p><p class="depth0">B. Purposes</p><p class="depth0">The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3400; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Indiana in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">C. Responsible Administrative Agencies</p><p class="depth0">The Natural Resource Commission (NRC) and the Division of Reclamation (DOR) of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources will be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor under the approved Indiana Regulatory Program. The Office of Surface and Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">Article II: Effective Date</p><p class="depth0">After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register as a final rule. This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.</p><p class="depth0">Article III: Definitions</p><p class="depth0">The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in SMCRA, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the OSM approved State Act (I.C. 14-34), and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV: Applicability</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in Indiana except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA, 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Article V: General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">A. Authority of State Agency: DOR and NRC have and will continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">B. Funds: 1. Upon application by DOR and subject to appropriations, OSM will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of SMCRA, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOR and NRC in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. OSM's Indianapolis Field Office and OSM's Mid-Continent Region Coordinating Center office will work with DOR to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in Indiana in the absence of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">3. OSM and the State will discuss the OSM Federal lands cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOR will include the Federal lands cost estimate in the State's annual regulatory grant application submitted to OSM's Indianapolis Field Office.</p><p class="depth0">The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations in estimated regulatory costs for the following grant year. OSM will notify DOR as soon as possible if such projections are not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">4. If DOR applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and DOR will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Indiana are regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">5. Funds provided to the DOR under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance

with Office of Management and Budget Common Rule for Uniform Administration Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reports and Records: DOR will make annual reports to OSM containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, DOR and OSM will exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth0">OSM will provide DOR with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. DOR comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress, unless necessary to respond to a request by a date certain, or to other interested parties.</p><p class="depth0">D. Personnel: Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, the DOR will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and the Program.</p><p class="depth0">E. Equipment and Laboratories: Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, the DOR will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Indiana will be determined in accordance with the approved Indiana Program. All permit fees, civil penalties and fines collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be deposited within the Natural Resources Reclamation Division Fund. Permit fees will be considered program income. Civil penalties and fines will not be considered program income. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will include a report of the amount of fees, penalties, and fines collected on such permits during the State's prior fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package</p><p class="depth0">A. Submission of Permit Application Package:</p><p class="depth0">1. DOR and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to DOR. DOR will furnish OSM and other Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by DOR and will include any supplemental information required by OSM, the Federal land management agency, and other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP.</p><p class="depth0">At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 740.13(b) and include the information necessary for DOR to make a determination of compliance with the Program and for OSM and the appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are responsible.</p><p class="depth0">2. For any outstanding or pending permit applications on Federal lands being processed by OSM prior to the effective date of this Agreement, OSM will maintain sole permit decision responsibility. After the final decision, all additional responsibilities shall pass to DOR pursuant to the terms of this Agreement along with any attendant fees, fines, or civil penalties therefrom.</p><p class="depth0">B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved:</p><p class="depth0">1. DOR will assume the responsibilities for review of PAPs where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to consultation with the Federal land management agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), DOR will be responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions, the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOR will request such Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOR within 45 calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSM will assist DOR in obtaining this information, upon request. Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to DOR under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSM and the State, with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. DOR will assume responsibility for the analysis, review and approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit application component of the PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Indiana on Federal lands not requiring a mining plan pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). DOR will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and the OSM approved State Act and regulations. DOR will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding decisions on the PAP and will be responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Secretary will make his determinations under SMCRA that cannot be delegated to the State. Some of which have been delegated to OSM.</p><p class="depth0">4. OSM and DOR will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. OSM will provide technical assistance to DOR when requested, if available resources allow. DOR will keep OSM informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies. OSM may provide assistance to DOR in resolving conflicts with Federal land management agencies. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DOR. OSM will have access to DOR files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSM will send to DOR copies of all resulting correspondence between OSM and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOR to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">5. DOR will make a decision on approval, disapproval or conditional approval of the permit on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any permit issued by DOR will incorporate any lawful terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The permit will include lawful terms and conditions required by other applicable Federal laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After making its decision on the PAP, DOR will send a notice to the applicant, OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the permit and written findings will be submitted to OSM upon request.</p><p class="depth0">C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal Is involved:</p><p class="depth0">1. DOR will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), DOR will assume responsibility for the analysis, review and approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Indiana where a mining plan is required, including applications for revisions, renewals and transfer sale and assignment of such permits. OSM will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and review.</p><p class="depth0">DOR will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">DOR will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations.</p><p class="depth0">DOR will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land management agency and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2) and (3), respectively. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487, BLM will be the primary contact with the applicant. BLM will inform DOR of its actions and provide DOR with a copy of documentation on all decisions.</p><p class="depth0">DOR will send the OSM copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the PAP. OSM will send to DOR copies of all correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, OSM will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program.</p><p class="depth0">DOR will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOR will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOR within 45 days of the date of receipt of the PAP.

The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities under 30 CFR 740.4(a) that cannot be delegated to DOR under the Federal lands program, MLA, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid to the extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.</p><p class="depth0">Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSM and DOR, with concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the Secretary approve the mining plan, OSM will consult with and obtain the concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land management agency and other Federal agencies as required.</p><p class="depth0">The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOR to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.</p><p class="depth0">3. OSM will assist DOR in carrying out DOR's responsibilities by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between DOR and other Federal agencies in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between State and Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where OSM is assisting DOR in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to DOR the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by OSM and DOR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.</p><p class="depth0">4. Review of the PAP:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OSM and DOR will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. DOR will keep OSM informed of findings and technical analyses made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies. OSM will ensure that any information it receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to DOR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DOR will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OSM will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> OSM and DOR will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between OSM and DOR throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSM will furnish DOR with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, DOR will provide OSM all available information that may aid OSM in preparing any findings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DOR will prepare a State decision package, including written findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for processing PAPs agreed upon by DOR and OSM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> DOR may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that DOR advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining operations on the Federal lease.

A copy of the written findings and the permit will also be submitted to OSM.</p><p class="depth2">5. OSM will provide technical assistance to DOR when requested, if available resources allow. OSM will have access to DOR files concerning operations on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth2">D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions; Renewals; and Transfer</p><p class="depth2">Assignment or Sate of Permit Rights:</p><p class="depth2">1. Any permit revision or renewal for an operation on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by DOR after consultation with OSM on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification pursuant to 30 CFR 746.18. OSM will inform DOR within 30 days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision or renewal, whether the permit revision, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSM and DOR will follow the procedures outlined in paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of this Article.</p><p class="depth2">2. OSM may establish criteria consistent with 30 CFR 746.18 to determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications.</p><p class="depth2">3. Permit revisions or renewals on Federal lands which are determined by OSM not to constitute mining plan modifications under paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not being mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of this Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures set forth under Indiana law and the State Program and paragraphs B.1. through B.5. of this Article.</p><p class="depth2">4. Transfer, assignment or sale of permit rights on Federal lands shall be processed in accordance with Indiana law and the State Program and 30 CFR 740.13(e).</p><p class="depth2">Article VII: Inspections</p><p class="depth2">A. DOR will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.</p><p class="depth2">B. DOR will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSM a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.</p><p class="depth2">C. DOR will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department of the Interior may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth2">D. OSM will give DOR reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection.</p><p class="depth2">When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact DOR no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to DOR for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DOR to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.</p><p class="depth2">Article VIII: Enforcement</p><p class="depth2">A. DOR will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA concerning compliance with the requirements of the Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2">B. During any joint inspection by OSM and DOR, DOR will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. DOR will inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth2">C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where DOR and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846.</p><p class="depth2">D. DOR and OSM will promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations</p><p class="depth2">E. Personnel of DOR and the Department of the Interior, including OSM, will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.</p><p class="depth2">F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth2">Article IX: Bonds</p><p class="depth2">A. DOR and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the State of Indiana and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Secretary or the Federal land management agency. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. DOR will advise OSM of annual adjustments to the performance bond pursuant to the Program.</p><p class="depth2">B. Performance bonds will be subject to release and forfeiture in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program. Where surface coal mining and reclamation operations are subject to an approved mining plan, a performance bond shall be released by the State after the release is concurred in by OSM.</p><p class="depth2">C. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.
Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for all or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid</p><p class="depth2">Existing Rights (VER) and Compatibility Determinations</p><p class="depth2">A.
