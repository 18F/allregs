MRO reported the specimen to you as negative-dilute and that a second collection must take place under direct observation (see Sec. 40.197(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As an employer, you must direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty test or a follow-up test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a collector, you must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are directed by the DER to do so (see paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You observed materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen (see Sec. Sec. 40.61(f)(5)(i) and 40.63(e)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The temperature on the original specimen was out of range (see Sec. 40.65(b)(5)); or (4) The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with (see Sec. 40.65(c)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> As the employer, you must explain to the employee the reason for a directly observed collection under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As the employer, you must explain to the employee the reason for a directly observed collection under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As the collector, you must explain to the employee the reason, if known, under this part for a directly observed collection under paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As the collector, you must complete a new CCF for the directly observed collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must mark the ``reason for test'' block (Step 1) the same as for the first collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must check the ``Observed, (Enter Remark)'' box and enter the reason (see Sec. 40.67(b)) in the ``Remarks'' line (Step 2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In a case where two sets of specimens are being sent to the laboratory because of suspected tampering with the specimen at the collection site, enter on the ``Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2) for each specimen a notation to this effect (e.g., collection 1 of 2, or 2 of 2) and the specimen ID number of the other specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> As the collector, you must ensure that the observer is the same gender as the employee.

If you, the collector, are the observer, you too must follow these procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> As the observer, you must request the employee to raise his or her shirt, blouse, or dress/skirt, as appropriate, above the waist; and lower clothing and underpants to show you, by turning around, that they do not have a prosthetic device. After you have determined that the employee does not have such a device, you may permit the employee to return clothing to its proper position for observed urination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> As the observer, you must watch the employee urinate into the collection container. Specifically, you are to watch the urine go from the employee's body into the collection container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> As the observer but not the collector, you must not take the collection container from the employee, but you must observe the specimen as the employee takes it to the collector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> As the collector, when someone else has acted as the observer, you must include the observer's name in the ``Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> As the employee, if you decline to allow a directly observed collection required or permitted under this section to occur, this is a refusal to test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> As the collector, when you learn that a directly observed collection should have been collected but was not, you must inform the employer that it must direct the employee to have an immediate recollection under direct observation.
