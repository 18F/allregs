                                Sec. 24.4  Resource management and public activities on Federal lands.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The four major systems of Federal lands administered by the  Department of the Interior are lands administered by the Bureau of  Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, units of the National Wildlife  Refuge System and national fish hatcheries, and units of the National  Park System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Bureau of Reclamation withdraws public lands and acquires  non-   Federal lands for construction and operation of water resource  development projects within the 17 Western States. Recreation and  conservation or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources are often  designated project purposes. General authority for Reclamation to modify  project structures, develop facilities, and acquire lands to accommodate  fish and wildlife resources is given to the Fish and Wildlife  Coordination Act of 1946, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661-667e). That act  further provides that the lands, waters and facilities designated for  fish and wildlife management purposes, in most instances, should be made  available by cooperative agreement to the agency exercising the  administration of these resources of the particular State involved. The  Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, as amended, also directs  Reclamation to encourage non-Federal public bodies to administer project  land and water areas for recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement.  Reclamation withdrawal, however, does not enlarge the power of the  United States with respect to management of fish and resident wildlife  and, except for activities specified in Section III.3 above, basic  authority and responsibility for management of fish and resident  wildlife on such lands remains with the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BLM-administered lands comprise in excess of 300 million acres  that support significant and diverse populations of fish and wildlife.  Congress in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43  U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) directed that non-wilderness BLM lands be managed  by the Secretary under principles of multiple use and sustained yield,  and for both wilderness and non-wilderness lands explicitly recognized  and reaffirmed the primary authority and responsibility of the States  for management of fish and resident wildlife on such lands.  Concomitantly, the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the  responsibility to manage non-wilderness BLM lands for multiple uses,  including fish and wildlife conservation. However, this authority to  manage lands for fish and wildlife values is not a preemption of State  jurisdiction over fish and wildlife. In exercising this responsibility  the Secretary is empowered to close areas to hunting, fishing or  trapping for specified reasons viz., public safety, administration, or  compliance with provisions of applicable law. The closure authority of  the Secretary is thus a power to close areas to particular activities  for particular reasons and does not in and of itself constitute a grant  of authority to the Secretary to manage wildlife or require or authorize  the issuance of hunting and/or fishing permits or licenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> While the several States therefore possess primary authority and  responsibility for management of fish and resident wildlife on Bureau of  Land Management lands, the Secretary, through the Bureau of Land  Management, has custody of the land itself and the habitat upon which  fish and resident wildlife are dependent. Management of the habitat is a  responsibility of the Federal Government. Nevertheless, Congress in the  Sikes Act has directed the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with  the States in developing programs on certain public lands, including  those administered by BLM and the Department of Defense, for the  conservation and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife including specific  habitat improvement projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System occur in nearly  every State and constitute Federally owned or controlled areas set aside  primarily as conservation areas for migratory waterfowl and other  species of fish or wildlife. Units of the system also provide outdoor  enjoyment for millions of visitors annually for the purpose of hunting,  fishing and wildlife-associated recreation. In 1962 and 1966, Congress  authorized the use of National Wildlife Refuges for outdoor recreation  provided that it is compatible with the primary purposes for which the  particular refuge was established. In contrast to multiple use public  lands, the conservation, enhancement and perpetuation of fish and  wildlife is almost invariably the principal reason for the establishment  of a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System. In consequence,  Federal activity respecting management of migratory waterfowl and other  wildlife residing on units of the National Wildlife Refuge System   involves a Federal function specifically authorized by Congress. It is  therefore for the Secretary to determine whether units of the System  shall be open to public uses, such as hunting and fishing, and on what  terms such access shall be granted. However, in recognition of the  existing jurisdictional relationship between the States and the Federal  Government, Congress, in the National Wildlife Refuge System  Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), has explicitly stated that  nothing therein shall be construed as affecting the authority of the  several States to manage fish and resident wildlife found on units of  the system. Thus, Congress has directed that, to the maximum extent  practicable, such public uses shall be consistent with State laws and  regulations. Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, therefore,  shall be managed, to the extent practicable and compatible with the  purposes for which they were established, in accordance with State laws  and regulations, comprehensive plans for fish and wildlife developed by  the States, and Regional Resource Plans developed by the Fish and  Wildlife Service in cooperation with the States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Units of the National Park System contain natural, recreation,  historic, and cultural values of national significance as designated by  Executive and Congressional action. Specific enabling legislation has  authorized limited hunting, trapping or fishing activity within certain  areas of the system. As a general rule, consumptive resource utilization  is prohibited. Those areas which do legislatively allow hunting,  trapping, or fishing, do so in conformance with applicable Federal and  State laws. The Superintendent may, in consultation with the appropriate  State agency, fix times and locations where such activities will be  prohibited. Areas of the National Park System which permit fishing  generally will do so in accordance with applicable State and Federal  Laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, State laws are not  applicable. However, every attempt shall be made to consult with the  appropriate States to minimize conflicting and confusing regulations  which may cause undue hardship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The management of habitat for species of wildlife, populations  of wildlife, or individual members of a population shall be in  accordance with a Park Service approved Resource Management Plan. The  appropriate States shall be consulted prior to the approval of  management actions, and memoranda of understanding shall be executed as  appropriate to ensure the conduct of programs which meet mutual  objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Federal agencies of the Department of the Interior shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare fish and wildlife management plans in cooperation with  State fish and wildlife agencies and other Federal (non-Interior)  agencies where appropriate. Where such plans are prepared for Federal  lands adjoining State or private lands, the agencies shall consult with  the State or private landowners to coordinate management objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within their statutory authority and subject to the management  priorities and strategies of such agencies, institute fish and wildlife  habitat management practices in cooperation with the States to assist  the States in accomplishing their fish and wildlife resource plans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide for public use of Federal lands in accordance with State  and Federal laws, and permit public hunting, fishing and trapping within  statutory and budgetary limitations and in a manner compatible with the  primary objectives for which the lands are administered. The hunting,  fishing, and trapping, and the possession and disposition of fish, game,  and fur animals, shall be conducted in all other respects within the  framework of applicable State and Federal laws, including requirements  for the possession of appropriate State licenses or permits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For those Federal lands that are already open for hunting,  fishing, or trapping, closure authority shall not be exercised without  prior consultation with the affected States, except in emergency  situations. The Bureau of Land Management may, after consultation with  the States, close all or any portion of public land under its  jurisdiction to public hunting, fishing, or trapping for reasons of  public safety, administration, or compliance with   provisions of applicable law. The National Park Service and Fish and  Wildlife Service may, after consultation with the States, close all or  any portion of Federal land under their jurisdictions, or impose such  other restrictions as are deemed necessary, for reasons required by the  Federal laws governing the management of their areas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Consult with the States and comply with State permit  requirements in connection with the activities listed below, except in  instances where the Secretary of the Interior determines that such  compliance would prevent him from carrying out his statutory  responsibilities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In carrying out research programs involving the taking or  possession of fish and wildlife or programs involving reintroduction of  fish and wildlife;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the planned and orderly removal of surplus or harmful  populations of fish and wildlife except where emergency situations  requiring immediate action make such consultation and compliance with  State regulatory requirements infeasible; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the disposition of fish and wildlife taken under paragraph  (i) (5)(i) or (i) (5)(ii) of this section.</p>
