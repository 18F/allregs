                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State statutes or policies concerning organizational conflict of interest should be specified or referenced in the design-build RFQ or RFP document as well as any contract for engineering services, inspection or technical support in the administration of the design-build contract. All design-build solicitations should address the following situations as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consultants and/or sub-consultants who assist the owner in the preparation of a RFP document will not be allowed to participate as an offeror or join a team submitting a proposal in response to the RFP. However, a contracting agency may determine there is not an organizational conflict of interest for a consultant or sub-consultant where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The role of the consultant or sub-consultant was limited to provision of preliminary design, reports, or similar ``low-level'' documents that will be incorporated into the RFP, and did not include assistance in development of instructions to offerors or evaluation criteria, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where all documents and reports delivered to the agency by the consultant or sub-consultant are made available to all offerors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All solicitations for design-build contracts, including related contracts for inspection, administration or auditing services, must include a provision which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directs offerors attention to this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> States the nature of the proposed restraint or restrictions (and duration) upon future contracting activities, if appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether or not the terms of any proposed clause and the application of this subpart to the contract are subject to negotiation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Requires offerors to provide information concerning potential organizational conflicts of interest in their proposals. The apparent successful offerors must disclose all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interests which may present an organizational conflict of interest. Such firms must state how their interests, or those of their chief executives, directors, key project personnel, or any proposed consultant, contractor or subcontractor may result, or could be viewed as, an organizational conflict of interest. The information may be in the form of a disclosure statement or a certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Based upon a review of the information submitted, the owner should make a written determination of whether the offeror's interests create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and identify any actions that must be taken to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. The owner should award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless an organizational conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The organizational conflict of interest provisions in this subpart provide minimum standards for STDs to identify, mitigate or eliminate apparent or actual organizational conflicts of interest. To the extent that State-developed organizational conflict of interest standards are more stringent than that contained in this subpart, the State standards prevail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the NEPA process has been completed prior to issuing the RFP, the contracting agency may allow a consultant or subconsultant who prepared the NEPA document to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the NEPA process has not been completed prior to issuing the RFP, the contracting agency may allow a subconsultant to the preparer of the NEPA document to participate as an offeror or join a team submitting a proposal in response to the RFP only if the contracting agency releases such subconsultant from further responsibilities with respect to the preparation of the NEPA document.
