You also must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of materials fed, charged, or placed in an EAF including, but not limited to, calibration of weighing equipment and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates must be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you are required to calculate CH4 emissions for the EAF as specified in Sec. 98.113(d), you must maintain records of the total amount of each alloy product produced for the specified reporting period, and the appropriate alloy-product specific emission factor used to calculate the CH4 emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Verification software records. You must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software specified in Sec. 98.5(b) for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (13) of this section.
