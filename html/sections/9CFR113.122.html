                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Salmonella Choleraesuis Bacterin shall be prepared from a culture of  Salmonella choleraesuis which has been inactivated and is nontoxic. Each  serial of biological product containing Salmonella choleraesuis fraction  shall meet the applicable requirements in 9 CFR 113.100 and shall be  tested for purity, safety, and potency as prescribed in this section. A  serial found unsatisfactory by any prescribed test shall not be  released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purity test. Final container samples of completed product shall  be tested for viable bacteria and fungi as provided in 9 CFR 113.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.  The subcutaneous route shall be used when the product is in combination  with Pasteurella Multocida Bacterin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Potency test. Bulk or final container samples of completed  product from each serial shall be tested for potency using the mouse  test provided in this paragraph. A mouse dose shall be \1/20\ of the  least dose recommended on the label for other animals which shall not be  less than 2 ml.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ability of the bacterin being tested (Unknown) to protect  mice shall be compared with a Standard Reference Bacterin (Standard)  which is either supplied by or acceptable to Veterinary Services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least three fivefold dilutions shall be made with the  Standard and the same fivefold dilution shall be made for each Unknown.  The dilutions shall be made in Phosphate-Buffered Saline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each dilution of the Standard and each dilution of an  Unknown, a group of at least 20 mice, each weighing 16 to 22 grams,  shall be used. Each mouse in a group shall be injected intraperitoneally  with one mouse dose   of the appropriate dilution. Each mouse shall be revaccinated on day 14,  using the same schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each of 20 vaccinated mice per group shall be challenged  intraperitoneally 7 to 10 days after the second vaccination with a 0.25  ml dose containing 10-1,000 mouse LD50 as determined by  titration of a suitable culture of Salmonella choleraesuis. All  survivors in each group of mice shall be recorded 14 days postchallenge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test for valid assay: At least two dilutions of the Standard  shall protect more than 0 percent and two dilutions shall protect less  than 100 percent of the mice injected. The lowest dilution of the  Standard shall protect more than 50 percent of the mice. The highest  dilution of the Standard shall protect less than 50 percent of the mice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The relative potency (RP) of the Unknown is determined by  comparing the 50 percent endpoint dilution (highest bacterin dilution  protecting 50 percent of the mice) of the Unknown with that of the  Standard by the following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.019</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the RP of the Unknown is less than 0.50, the serial being  tested is unsatisfactory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the 50 percent endpoint of an Unknown cannot be calculated  because the lowest dilution does not exceed 50 percent protection, that  serial may be retested in a manner identical to the initial test;  Provided, That, if the Unknown is not retested or if the protection  provided by the lowest dilution of the Standard exceeds the protection  provided by the lowest dilution of the Unknown by six mice or more; or,  if the total number of mice protected by the Standard exceeds the total  number of mice protected by the Unknown by eight mice or more, the  serial being tested is unsatisfactory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If the 50 percent endpoint of an Unknown in a valid test cannot  be calculated because the highest dilution exceeds 50 percent  protection, the Unknown is satisfactory without additional testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the RP is less than the minimum required in paragraph (c)(7)  of this section, the serial may be retested by conducting two  independent replicate tests in a manner identical to the initial test.  The average of the RP values obtained in the retests shall be  determined. If the average RP is less than the required minimum, the  serial is unsatisfactory. If the average RP obtained in the retests is  equal to or greater than the required minimum, the following shall  apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the RP obtained in the original test is one-third or less  than the average RP obtained in the retests, the initial RP may be  considered a result of test system error and the serial is satisfactory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the RP value obtained in the original test is more than one- third the average RP obtained in the retests, a new average shall be  determined using the RP values obtained in all tests. If the new average  is less than the minimum required in paragraph (c)(7) of this section,  the serial is unsatisfactory.  [43 FR 25077, June 9, 1978, as amended at 48 FR 31008, July 6, 1983.
