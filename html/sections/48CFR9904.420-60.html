The research segment performs work under:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Research and development contracts,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Projects which are not part of its own IR&D; plan but are  specifically in support of other segments' IR&D; projects, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> IR&D; projects for the benefit of the company as a whole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The research segment directly allocates the cost of the projects  in support of another segment's IR&D; projects, including an allocation  of its general and administrative expenses, to the receiving segment.  This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420-50(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The costs of the IR&D; projects which benefit the company as a  whole exclude any allocation of the research segment's general and  administrative expenses and are transferred to the home office. The home  office allocates these costs on the same base it uses to allocate its  residual expenses to all seven segments. This practice meets the  requirements of 9904.420-50 (e)(2) and (f)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Company F accumulates at the home office the costs of IR&D; and  B&P; projects which generally benefit all segments of the company except  Segment X. The company and the contracting officer agree that the nature  of the business activity of Segment X is such that the home office IR&D;  and B&P; effort is neither caused by nor provides any benefit to that  segment. For the purpose of allocating its home office residual  expenses, the company uses a base as provided in 9904.403. For the  purpose of allocating the home office IR&D; and B&P; costs, the company  removes the data of Segment X from the base used for the allocation of  its residual expenses. This practice meets the requirements of 9904.420- 50(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Company G has 10 segments. Segment X performs IR&D; projects, the  results of which benefit it and two other segments but none of the other  seven segments. The cost of those projects performed by Segment X are  transferred to the home office and allocated to the three segments on  the basis of   the benefits received by the three segments. This practice meets the  requirements of 9904.420-50(e)(1) and 9904.420-50(f)(1).</p>
