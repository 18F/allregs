                            <p class="depth0">If a project is redesigned in response to EPA's objections, the applicant for Federal financial assistance or the grantor agency may file a petition with the Regional Administrator for withdrawal of the determination that the project may contaminate the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health. Any such petition shall demonstrate how the project has been redesigned so as to justify the withdrawal of EPA's objections. If appropriate, the Regional Administrator may request public comments or hold an informal public hearing to consider the petition. After review of pertinent information, the Regional Administrator shall either deny the petition or recommend to the Administrator that the initial determination that a project may contaminate the aquifer be vacated. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Regional Administrator that a determination be vacated, the Administrator shall either deny the petition or order that the initial determination be vacated. The final decision regarding a petition shall be published in the Federal Register with an accompanying statement of reasons.</p>
