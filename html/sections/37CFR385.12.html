                                Sec.  385.12  Calculation of royalty payments in general.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicable royalty. Licensees that make or authorize licensed  activity pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115 shall pay royalties therefor that are  calculated as provided in this section, subject to the minimum royalties  and subscriber-based royalty floors for specific types of services  provided in Sec.  385.13, except as provided for certain promotional  uses in Sec.  385.14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this  section. If a service includes different offerings, royalties must be  separately calculated with respect to each such offering taking into  consideration service revenue and expenses associated with such  offering. Uses subject to the promotional royalty rate shall be excluded  from the calculation of royalties due, as further described in this  section and the following Sec.  385.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Step 1: Calculate the All-In Royalty for the Offering. For each  accounting period, the all-in royalty for each   offering of the service provider is the greater of</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicable percentage of service revenue associated with the  relevant offering as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section  (excluding any service revenue derived solely from licensed activity  uses subject to the promotional royalty rate), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum specified in Sec.  385.13 of the offering involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Step 2: Subtract Applicable Performance Royalties. From the  amount determined in step 1 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for  each offering of the service provider, subtract the total amount of  royalties for public performance of musical works that has been or will  be expensed pursuant to public performance licenses in connection with  uses of musical works through such offering during the accounting period  that constitute licensed activity (other than licensed activity subject  to the promotional royalty rate). Although this amount may be the total  of the service's payments for that offering for the accounting period ,  it will be less than the total of such public performance payments if  the service is also engaging in public performance of musical works that  does not constitute licensed activity. In the case where the service is  also engaging in the public performance of musical works that does not  constitute licensed activity, the amount to be subtracted for public  performance payments shall be the amount of such payments allocable to  licensed activity uses (other than promotional royalty rate uses)  through the relevant offering, as determined in relation to all uses of  musical works for which the public performance payments are made for the  accounting period. Such allocation shall be made on the basis of plays  of musical works or, where per-play information is unavailable due to  bona fide technical limitations as described in step 4 in paragraph  (b)(4) of this section, using the same alternative methodology as  provided in step 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Step 3: Determine the Payable Royalty Pool. The payable royalty  pool is the amount payable for the reproduction and distribution of all  musical works used by the service provider by virtue of its licensed  activity for a particular offering during the accounting period. This  amount is the greater of</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The result determined in step 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subscriber-based royalty floor resulting from the  calculations described in Sec.  385.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Step 4: Calculate the Per-Work Royalty Allocation for Each  Relevant Work. This is the amount payable for the reproduction and  distribution of each musical work used by the service provider by virtue  of its licensed activity through a particular offering during the  accounting period. To determine this amount, the result determined in  step 3 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be allocated to each  musical work used through the offering. The allocation shall be  accomplished by dividing the payable royalty pool determined in step 3  for such offering by the total number of plays of all musical works  through such offering during the accounting period (other than  promotional royalty rate plays) to yield a per-play allocation, and  multiplying that result by the number of plays of each musical work  (other than promotional royalty rate plays) through the offering during  the accounting period. For purposes of determining the per-work royalty  allocation in all calculations under this step 4 only (i.e., after the  payable royalty pool has been determined), for sound recordings of  musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes, each play shall be  counted as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if the service provider is not capable of tracking play  information due to bona fide limitations of the available technology for  services of that nature or of devices useable with the service, the per- work royalty allocation may instead be accomplished in a manner  consistent with the methodology used by the service provider for making  royalty payment allocations for the use of individual sound recordings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Percentage of service revenue. The percentage of service revenue  applicable under paragraph (b) of this section is 10.5%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overtime adjustment. For purposes of the calculations in step 4  in paragraph (b)(4) of this section only, for   sound recordings of musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes,  adjust the number of plays as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 5:01 to 6:00 minutes--Each play = 1.2 plays</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 6:01 to 7:00 minutes--Each play = 1.4 plays</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 7:01 to 8:00 minutes--Each play = 1.6 plays</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 8:01 to 9:00 minutes--Each play = 1.8 plays</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 9:01 to 10:00 minutes--Each play = 2.0 plays</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For playing times of greater than 10 minutes, continue to add .2  for each additional minute or fraction thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Accounting. The calculations required by paragraph (b) of this  section shall be made in good faith and on the basis of the best  knowledge, information and belief of the licensee at the time payment is  due, and subject to the additional accounting and certification  requirements of 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(5) and Sec.  201.19 of this title.  Without limitation, a licensee's statements of account shall set forth  each step of its calculations with sufficient information to allow the  copyright owner to assess the accuracy and manner in which the licensee  determined the payable royalty pool and per-play allocations (including  information sufficient to demonstrate whether and how a minimum royalty  or subscriber-based royalty floor pursuant to Sec.  385.13 does or does  not apply) and, for each offering reported, also indicate the type of  licensed activity involved and the number of plays of each musical work  (including an indication of any overtime adjustment applied) that is the  basis of the per-work royalty allocation being paid.
