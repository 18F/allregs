                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with the foregoing policy, the Postal Service Office of Licensing, Philatelic and Retail Services Department, formulates the program for the management of the Postal Service's rights in intellectual property (except patents and technical data rights in Postal Service contracts,

which is the responsibility of Postal Service contracting officers). The Office of Licensing and the contracting officers identify intellectual properties in which the Postal Service should secure its rights. It receives and makes recommendations for the disposition of applications for use of Postal Service intellectual property. It periodically reviews the intellectual property rights portfolio to determine the extent of the utilization of protected properties and to recommend relinquishment of ownership when it considers ownership no longer desirable. It is advised by the Office of Procurement of performance under license agreements and makes recommendations for corrective measures when necessary. In consultation with the Law Department, it recommends appropriate action against unauthorized use of intellectual property.
