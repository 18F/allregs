                                Sec. 30.626  How will OWCP coordinate compensation payable under Part E
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OWCP will reduce the compensation payable under Part E by the  amount of benefits the claimant receives from a state workers'  compensation program by reason of the same covered illness, after  deducting the reasonable costs to the claimant of obtaining those  benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine the amount of any reduction of EEOICPA  compensation, OWCP shall require the covered Part E employee or each  eligible surviving beneficiary filing a claim under Part E to execute  and provide affidavits reporting the amount of any benefit received  pursuant to a claim filed in a state workers' compensation program for  the same covered illness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a covered Part E employee or a survivor of such employee  receives benefits through a state workers' compensation program pursuant  to a claim for the same covered illness, OWCP shall reduce a portion of  the dollar amount of such state workers' benefit from the compensation  payable under Part E. OWCP will calculate the net amount of the state  workers' compensation benefit amount to be subtracted from the  compensation payment under Part E in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OWCP will first determine the dollar value of the benefits  received by that individual from a state workers' compensation program  by including all benefits, other than medical and vocational  rehabilitation benefits, received for the same covered illness or injury  sustained as a consequence of a covered illness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OWCP will then make certain deductions from the above dollar  benefit received under a state workers' compensation program to arrive  at the dollar amount that will be subtracted from any compensation  payable under Part E of EEOICPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allowable deductions consist of reasonable costs in obtaining  state workers' compensation benefits incurred by that individual,  including but not limited to attorney's fees OWCP deems reasonable and  itemized costs of suit (out-of-pocket expenditures not part of the  normal overhead of a law firm's operation like filing, travel expenses,  witness fees, and court reporter costs for transcripts), provided that  adequate supporting documentation is submitted to OWCP for its  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EEOICPA benefits that will be reduced will consist of any  unpaid monetary payments payable in the future and medical benefits  payable in the future. In those cases where it has not yet paid EEOICPA  benefits under Part E, OWCP will reduce such benefits on a dollar-for- dollar basis, beginning with the current monetary payments first. If the  amount to be subtracted exceeds the monetary payments currently payable,  OWCP will reduce ongoing EEOICPA medical benefits payable in the future  by the amount of any remaining surplus. This means that OWCP will apply  the amount it would otherwise pay to reimburse the covered Part E  employee for any ongoing EEOICPA medical treatment to the remaining  surplus until it is absorbed (or until further monetary benefits become  payable that are sufficient to absorb the surplus).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The above coordination of benefits will not occur if the  beneficiary under a state workers' compensation program receives state  workers' compensation benefits for both a covered and a non-covered  illness arising out of and in the course of the same work-related  incident.</p>
