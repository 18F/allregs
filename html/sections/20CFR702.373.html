                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon his/her own initiative, or upon application of any party in  interest (including an employer or carrier which has been granted relief  under section 8(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(f)), the district director  may review any compensation case (including a case under which payments  are made pursuant to section 44(i) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 944(i)) in  accordance with the procedure in subpart C of this part, and after such  review of the case under Sec. 702.315, or review at formal hearings  under the regulations governing formal hearings in subpart C of this  part, file a new compensation order terminating, continuing,  reinstating, increasing or decreasing such compensation, or awarding  compensation. Such new order shall not affect any compensation  previously paid, except that an award increasing the compensation rate  may be made retroactive from the date of injury, and if any part of the  compensation due or to become due is unpaid, an award decreasing the  compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and  any payment made prior thereto in excess of such decreased rate shall be  deducted from any unpaid compensation, in such manner and by such method  as may be determined by the district director or the administrative law  judge. Settlements cannot be modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of a compensation case under this section may be made at  any time prior to 1 year after the date of the last payment of  compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or at  any time prior to 1 year after the rejection of a claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of a compensation case may be had only for the reason  that there is a change in conditions or that there was a mistake in the  determination of facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the investigation, described in Sec. 702.148(c), discloses a  change in conditions and the employer or insurance carrier intends to  pursue modification of the award of compensation the district director  and claimant shall be notified through an informal conference. At the  conclusion of the informal conference the district director shall issue  a recommendation either for or against the modification. This  recommendation shall also be sent to the Associate Director, Division of  Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation (DLHWC) for a  determination on whether or not to participate in the modification  proceeding on behalf of the special fund. Lack of concurrence of the  Associate Director, DLHWC or   lack of participation by a representative of the special fund shall not  be a bar to the modification proceeding.
