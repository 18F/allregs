                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual filter performance. Systems using conventional  filtration treatment or direct filtration treatment receive 0.5-log  Cryptosporidium treatment credit, which can be in addition to the 0.5- log credit under paragraph (a) of this section, during any month the  system meets the criteria in this paragraph. Compliance with these  criteria must be based on individual filter turbidity monitoring as  described in Sec.  141.174 or Sec.  141.560, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The filtered water turbidity for each individual filter must be  less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of the  measurements recorded each month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No individual filter may have a measured turbidity greater than  0.3 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any system that has received treatment credit for individual  filter performance and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph  (b)(1) or (2) of this section during any month does not receive a  treatment technique violation under Sec.  141.711(c) if the State  determines the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The failure was due to unusual and short-term circumstances that  could not reasonably be prevented through optimizing treatment plant  design, operation, and maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The system has experienced no more than two such failures in  any calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstration of performance. The State may approve  Cryptosporidium treatment credit for drinking water treatment processes  based on a demonstration of performance study that meets the criteria in  this paragraph. This treatment credit may be greater than or less than  the prescribed treatment credits in Sec.  141.711 or Sec. Sec.  141.717  through 141.720 and may be awarded to treatment processes that do not  meet the criteria for the prescribed credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems cannot receive the prescribed treatment credit for any  toolbox box option in Sec. Sec.  141.717 through 141.720 if that toolbox  option is included in a demonstration of performance study for which  treatment credit is awarded under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The demonstration of performance study must follow a State- approved protocol and must demonstrate the level of Cryptosporidium  reduction the treatment process will achieve under the full range of  expected operating conditions for the system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approval by the State must be in writing and may include  monitoring and treatment performance criteria that the system must  demonstrate and report on an ongoing basis to remain eligible for the  treatment credit. The State may designate such criteria where necessary  to verify that the conditions under which the demonstration of  performance credit was approved are maintained during routine operation.</p>
