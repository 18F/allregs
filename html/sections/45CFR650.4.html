                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following Patent Rights clause will be used in every funding  agreement awarded by the Foundation that relates to scientific or  engineering research unless a special patent clause has been negotiated  (see Sec. 650.5).</p><p class="depth0">Patent Rights (August, 2005)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Invention means any invention or discovery  which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of  the United States Code, to any novel variety of plant which is or may be  protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et  seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subject invention means any invention of the grantee conceived  or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under  this grant, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of  determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety  Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of  grant performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Practical application means to manufacture in the case of a  composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method,  or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case,  under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being  utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by law or  Government regulations available to the public on reasonable terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception  or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Small business firm means a domestic small business concern as  defined at section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and  implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration. For the purpose of this Patents Rights clause, the size  standard for small business concerns involved in Government procurement  and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively,  will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Nonprofit organization means a domestic university or other  institution of higher education or an organization of the type described  in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C.  501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any domestic nonprofit scientific or  educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit organization  statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of Principal Rights. The grantee may retain the  entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject  invention subject to the provisions of this Patents Rights clause and 35  U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the grantee  retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive,  nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have  practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention  throughout the world. If the award indicates it is   subject to an identified international agreement or treaty, the National  Science Foundation (NSF) also has the right to direct the grantee to  convey to any foreign participant such patent rights to subject  inventions as are required to comply with that agreement or treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent  Applications by Grantee. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee will disclose each subject  invention to NSF within two months after the inventor discloses it in  writing to grantee personnel responsible for the administration of  patent matters. The disclosure to NSF will be submitted via the iEdison  Invention Information Management System maintained by the National  Institutes of Health and shall identify the grant under which the  invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently  complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the  nature, purpose, operation, and, to the extent known, the physical,  chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The  disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of  the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been  submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for  publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to  NSF, the grantee will promptly notify NSF of the acceptance of any  manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or  public use planned by the grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee will elect in writing whether or not to retain title  to any such invention by notifying NSF within two years of disclosure to  NSF. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has  initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection  can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of  title may be shortened by NSF to a date that is no more than 60 days  prior to the end of the statutory period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The grantee will file its initial patent application on an  invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after  election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory  period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United  States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The grantee will  file patent applications in additional countries or international patent  offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent  application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by  the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent  applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to NSF,  election, and filing under subparagraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this  clause may, at the discretion of NSF, be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title. The grantee  will convey to NSF, upon written request, title to any subject  invention:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the grantee fails to disclose or elect the subject invention  within the times specified in paragraph (c) above, or elects not to  retain title; provided that NSF may only request title within 60 days  after learning of the failure of the grantee to disclose or elect within  the specified times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In those countries in which the grantee fails to file patent  applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) above;  provided, however, that if the grantee has filed a patent application in  a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) above, but prior to  its receipt of the written request of NSF, the grantee shall continue to  retain title in that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In any country in which the grantee decides not to continue the  prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or  defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a  subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Minimum Rights to Grantee. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee will retain a  nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject  invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the grantee  fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in  paragraph (c) above. The grantee's license extends to its domestic  subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of  which the grantee is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses  of the same scope to the extent the grantee was legally obligated to do  so at the time the grant was awarded. The license is transferable only  with the approval of NSF except when transferred to the successor of  that part of the grantee's business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee's domestic license may be revoked or modified by NSF  to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of  the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive  license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR  part 404. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the  geographical areas in which the grantee has achieved practical  application and continues to make the benefits of the invention  reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country  may be revoked or modified at the discretion of NSF to the extent the  grantee, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have  failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, NSF will  furnish the grantee a written notice of its intention to revoke or  modify the license, and the grantee will be allowed thirty days (or such  other time as may   be authorized by NSF for good cause shown by the grantee) after the  notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified.  The grantee has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable  regulations in 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of Government- owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification  of its license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Grantee Action to Protect Government's Interest. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee  agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to NSF all  instruments necessary to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout  the world in those subject inventions for which the grantee retains  title, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Convey title to NSF when requested under paragraph (d) above,  and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the  world in that subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee agrees to require, by written agreement, its  employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose  promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the  administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the  grantee each subject invention made under this grant in order that the  grantee can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c)  above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications  on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the  subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, at a minimum,  the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) above. The grantee shall  instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other  suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions  in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to  U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The grantee will notify NSF of any decision not to continue  prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in  a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country,  not less than thirty days before the expiration of the response period  required by the relevant patent office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The grantee agrees to include, within the specification of any  United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering  a subject invention, the following statement: ``This invention was made  with Government support under (identify the grant) awarded by the  National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this  invention.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The grantee or its representative will complete, execute, and  submit electronically to NSF via the iEdison Invention Information  Management System maintained by the National Institutes of Health a  confirmation of a License to the United States Government and the page  of a United States patent application that contains the Federal support  clause within two months of filing any domestic or foreign patent  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Subcontracts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee will include this Patents Rights  clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts,  regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work.  The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the grantee in  this Patents Rights clause, and the grantee will not, as part of the  consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the  subcontractor's subject inventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award  by the Foundation was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative  agreement), NSF, subcontractor, and contractor agree that the mutual  obligations of the parties created by this Patents Rights clause  constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Foundation with  respect to those matters covered by this Patents Rights clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions. The grantee  agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than  annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at  obtaining such utilization that are being made by the grantee or its  licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding  the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross  royalties received by the grantee, and such other data and information  as NSF may reasonably specify. The grantee also agrees to provide  additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken  by NSF in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patents Rights clause.  As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), NSF agrees it will not disclose such  information to persons outside the Government without the permission of  the grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preference for United States Industry. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Patents Rights clause, the grantee agrees that neither  it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use  or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person  agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced  through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured  substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the  requirement for such an agreement may be waived by NSF upon a showing by  the grantee or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts  have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees  that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States  or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially  feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> March-in Rights. The grantee agrees that with respect to any  subject invention in   which it has acquired title, NSF has the right in accordance with  procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and NSF regulations at 45 CFR 650.13 to  require the grantee, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject  invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive  license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants,  upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the  grantee, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NSF has  the right to grant such a license itself if NSF determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such action is necessary because the grantee or assignee has not  taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective  steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such  field of use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs  which are not reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or their  licensees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use  specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not  reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or licensee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Such action is necessary because the agreement required by  paragraph (i) of this Patents Rights clause has not been obtained or  waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any  subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Special Provisions for Grants with Nonprofit Organizations. If  the grantee is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be  assigned without the approval of NSF, except where such assignment is  made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the  management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to  the same provisions as the grantee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee will share royalties collected on a subject  invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors  (when NSF deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned  in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The balance of any royalties or income earned by the grantee  with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including  payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject  inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific research or  education; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Communications. All communications required by this Patents  Rights clause must be submitted through the iEdison Invention  Information Management System maintained by the National Institutes of  Health unless prior permission for another form of submission is  obtained from the Patent Assistant at patents@nsf.gov or at Office of  the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard,  Arlington, VA 22230.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When the above Patent Rights clause is used in a funding  agreement other than a grant, ``grant'' and ``grantee'' may be replaced  by ``contract'' and ``contractor'' or other appropriate terms.
