                            <p class="depth0">Client devices that operate in a master/client network may be  certified if they have the capability of operating outside permissible  part 15 frequency bands, provided they operate on only permissible part  15 frequencies under the control of the master device with which they  communicate. Master devices marketed within the United States must be  limited to operation on permissible part 15 frequencies. Client devices  that can also act as master devices must meet the requirements of a  master device. For the purposes of this section, a master device is  defined as a device operating in a mode in which it has the capability  to transmit without receiving an enabling signal. In this mode it is  able to select a channel and initiate a network by sending enabling  signals to other devices. A network always has at least one device  operating in master mode. A client device is defined as a device  operating in a mode in which the transmissions of the device are under  control of the master. A device in client mode is not able to initiate a  network.
