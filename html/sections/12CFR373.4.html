                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 373.5 through 373.10, the sponsor of a securitization transaction must retain an eligible vertical interest or eligible horizontal residual interest, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the sponsor retains only an eligible vertical interest as its required risk retention, the sponsor must retain an eligible vertical interest in a percentage of not less than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the sponsor retains only an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the amount of the interest must equal at least 5 percent of the fair value of all ABS interests in the issuing entity issued as a part of the securitization transaction, determined using a fair value measurement framework under GAAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the sponsor retains both an eligible vertical interest and an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the percentage of the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest and the percentage of the eligible vertical interest must equal at least five.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The percentage of the eligible vertical interest, eligible horizontal residual interest, or combination thereof retained by the sponsor must be determined as of the closing date of the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Option to hold base amount in eligible horizontal cash reserve account. In lieu of retaining all or any part of an eligible horizontal residual interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor may, at closing of the securitization transaction, cause to be established and funded, in cash, an eligible horizontal cash reserve account in the amount equal to the fair value of such eligible horizontal residual interest or part thereof, provided that the account meets all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The account is held by the trustee (or person performing similar functions) in the name and for the benefit of the issuing entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts in the account are invested only in cash and cash equivalents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Until all ABS interests in the issuing entity are paid in full, or the issuing entity is dissolved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts in the account shall be released only to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Satisfy payments on ABS interests in the issuing entity on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to satisfy an amount due on any ABS interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pay critical expenses of the trust unrelated to credit risk on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to pay such expenses and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such expenses, in the absence of available funds in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account, would be paid prior to any payments to holders of ABS interests; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such payments are made to parties that are not affiliated with the sponsor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest (or other earnings) on investments made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be released once received by the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosures. A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption ``Credit Risk Retention'', a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities in the securitization transaction the following disclosures in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Horizontal interest. With respect to any eligible horizontal residual interest held under paragraph (a) of this section, a sponsor must disclose:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security issued in the same offering of ABS interests,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction. If the specific prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization are not available, the sponsor must disclose a range of fair values (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the close of the securitization transaction based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization. A sponsor disclosing a range of fair values based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization must also disclose the method by which it determined any range of prices, tranche sizes, or rates of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair values or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including any portion of the eligible horizontal residual interest retained by the sponsor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All key inputs and assumptions or a comprehensive description of such key inputs and assumptions that were used in measuring the estimated total fair value or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> To the extent applicable to the valuation methodology used, the disclosure required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section shall include, but should not be limited to, quantitative information about each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Discount rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Loss given default (recovery);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prepayment rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Default rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lag time between default and recovery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The basis of forward interest rates used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The disclosure required in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall include, at a minimum, descriptions of all inputs and assumptions that either could have a material impact on the fair value calculation or would be material to a prospective investor's ability to evaluate the sponsor's fair value calculations. To the extent the disclosure required in this paragraph (c)(1) includes a description of a curve or curves, the description shall include a description of the methodology that was used to derive each curve and a description of any aspects or features of each curve that could materially impact the fair value calculation or the ability of a prospective investor to evaluate the sponsor's fair value calculation. To the extent a sponsor uses information about the securitized assets in its calculation of fair value, such information shall not be as of a date more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided that for a subsequent issuance of ABS interests by the same issuing entity with the same sponsor for which the securitization transaction distributes amounts to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, such information shall not be as of a date more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided further, that the balance or value (in accordance with the transaction documents) of the securitized assets may be increased or decreased to reflect anticipated additions or removals of assets the sponsor makes or expects to make between the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the asset pool collateralizing such asset-backed security and the closing date of the securitization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A summary description of the reference data set or other historical information used to develop the key inputs and assumptions referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section, including loss given default and default rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest the sponsor retained at the closing of the securitization transaction, based on actual sale prices and finalized tranche sizes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to retain under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To the extent the valuation methodology or any of the key inputs and assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value or range of fair values disclosed prior to sale and required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section materially differs from the methodology or key inputs and assumptions used to calculate the fair

value at the time of closing, descriptions of those material differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the sponsor retains risk through the funding of an eligible horizontal cash reserve account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount to be placed (or that is placed) by the sponsor in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account at closing, and the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to fund through the eligible horizontal cash reserve account in order for such account, together with other retained interests, to satisfy the sponsor's risk retention requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal cash reserve account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The disclosures required in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vertical interest. With respect to any eligible vertical interest retained under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor must disclose:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security issued in the same offering of ABS interests,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The form of the eligible vertical interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage that the sponsor is required to retain as a vertical interest under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the material terms of the vertical interest and the amount that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of the vertical interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Record maintenance. A sponsor must retain the certifications and disclosures required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.</p>
