NRCS is to  announce dates for receiving applications through local media.  Applications are to be reviewed by the conservation district and/or  local reclamation committee,   which is to verify eligibility and recommend funding priorities to the  NRCS district conservationist. The NRCS district conservationist is to  assign funding priorities according to the recommendations unless he  determines that applications are incomplete, ineligible, or unfeasible.  Low priority applications that cannot be serviced within specific time  periods established by the State conservationist are to be returned to  the applicant with an appropriate explanation. These applicants may  reapply at a later date if they are still interested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible applicants are serviced within each subpriority  according to the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific type, amount, and relative importance of benefits  to be derived. (Public benefits and offsite environmental improvement  will take precedence over onsite benefits.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Feasibility and practicability of reclaiming for the proposed  uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Land user's ability to proceed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Date of the application.</p>
