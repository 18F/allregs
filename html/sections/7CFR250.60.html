                                Sec. 250.60  Use of donated foods in the school food service.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of donated foods in school lunches and other meals or  activities. The school food authority should use donated foods, as far  as practical, in the lunches served to schoolchildren, for which they  receive an established per-meal value of donated food assistance each  school year. However, the school food authority may also use donated  foods in other nonprofit school food service activities. Revenues  received from such activities must accrue to the school food authority's  nonprofit school food service account. Some examples of other activities  in which donated foods may be used include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> School breakfasts or other meals served in child nutrition  programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A la carte foods sold to children;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meals served to adults directly involved in the operation and  administration of the nonprofit food service, and to other school staff;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Training in nutrition, health, food service, or general home  economics instruction for students.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of donated foods outside of the nonprofit school food  service. The school food authority should not use donated foods in meals  or food service activities that do not benefit primarily schoolchildren,  such as banquets or catered events. However, their use in such meals or  activities may not always be avoided, e.g, for a school food authority  utilizing single inventory management. In all cases, the school food  authority must ensure reimbursement to the nonprofit school food service  account for the value of donated foods used in such activities, in  addition to reimbursement for other resources utilized from that  account. Since school food authorities utilizing single inventory  management cannot reimburse the nonprofit school food service account  based on actual usage of donated foods outside of the nonprofit school  food service, they must establish an alternate method--e.g., by  including the current per-meal value of donated food reimbursement in  the price charged for the food service activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of donated foods in a contract with a food service  management company. A school food authority may use donated foods in a  contract with a food service management company to conduct the food  service. The contract must meet the requirements in subpart D of this  part with respect to donated foods, and must also meet requirements in 7  CFR part 210 and 7 CFR parts 3016 or 3019, as applicable, with respect  to the procurement of such contracts. The school food authority must  also ensure that a food service management company providing meals for  banquets or catered events, or other food service activities that do not  benefit primarily schoolchildren, ensure reimbursement to the nonprofit  school food service account for donated foods used in such activities,  in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of donated foods in providing a meal service to other school  food authorities. A school food authority may use donated foods to  provide a meal service to other school food authorities, under an  agreement between the parties. A school food authority providing such a  service may commingle its own donated foods and the donated foods of  other school food authorities that are parties to the agreement.</p>
