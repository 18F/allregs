                                Sec. 220.178  Determining medical improvement and its relationship
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), and (c) of Sec. 220.177 discuss  what is meant by medical improvement, medical improvement not related to  the ability to work and medical improvement that is related to the  ability to work. How the Board will arrive at the decision that medical  improvement has occurred and its relationship to the ability to do work,  is discussed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining if medical improvement is related to ability to  work. If there is a decrease in medical severity as shown by the  symptoms, signs and laboratory findings, the Board then must determine  if it is related to the annuitant's ability to do work. In Sec.  220.177(d) the relationship between medical severity and limitation on  functional capacity to do basic work activities (or residual functional  capacity) and how changes in medical severity can affect the annuitant's  residual functional capacity is explained. In determining whether  medical improvement that has occurred is related to the annuitant's  ability to do work, the Board will assess the annuitant's residual  functional capacity (in accordance with Sec. 220.177(d)) based on the  current severity of the impairment(s) which was present at that  annuitant's last favorable medical decision. The annuitant's new  residual functional capacity will then be compared to the annuitant's  residual functional capcity at the time of the Board's most recent  favorable medical decision. Unless an increase in the current residual  functional capacity is based on changes in the signs, symptoms, or  laboratory findings, any medical improvement that has occurred will not  be considered to be related to the annuitant's ability to do work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional factors and considerations. The Board will also apply  the following in its determinations of medical improvement and its  relationship to the annuitant's ability to do work:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous impairment was medically disabling. If the Board's most  recent favorable decision was based on the fact that the annuitant's  impairment(s) at that time was medically disabling, an assessment of his  or her residual functional capacity would not have been made. If medical  improvement has occurred and the current severity of the prior  impairment(s) is no longer medically disabling based on the standard  (see Sec. 220.100(b)(3)) applied at the time of that decision, the  Board will find that the medical improvement was related to the  annuitant's ability to work. If the medical findings support  impairment(s) that is currently so severe as to be medically disabling,  the annuitant is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to  be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. If there has been  medical improvement to the degree that the impairment(s) is not  currently medically disabling, then there has been medical improvement  related to the annuitant's ability to work. The Board must, of course,  also establish that the annuitant can currently engage in gainful  activity before finding that his or her disability has ended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior residual functional capacity assessment made. The residual  functional capacity assessment used in making the most recent favorable  medical decision will be compared to the residual functional capacity  assessment based on current evidence in order to determine if an  annuitant's functional capacity for basic work activities has increased.  There will be no attempt made to reassess the prior residual functional  capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prior residual functional capacity assessment should have been  made, but was not. If the most recent favorable medical decision should  have contained an assessment of the annuitant's residual functional  capacity (i.e., his or her impairment(s) was not medically disabling)  but does not, either because this assessment is missing from the  annuitant's file or because it was not done, the Board will reconstruct  the residual functional capacity. This reconstructed residual functional  capacity will accurately and objectively assess the annuitant's  functional capacity to do basic work activities. The Board will assign  the maximum functional capacity consistent with an allowance.</p><p class="depth3">Example: The annuitant was previously found to be disabled on the  basis that while his impairment was not medically disabling, it did  prevent him from doing his past or any other work. The prior adjudicator  did not, however, include a residual functional capacity assessment in  the rationale of that decision and a review of the prior evidence does  not show that such an assessment was ever made. If a decrease in medical  severity, i.e., medical improvement, has occurred, the residual  functional capacity based on the current level of severity of the  annuitant's impairment will have to be compared with his residual  functional capacity based on its prior severity in order to determine if  the medical improvement is related to his ability to do work. In order  to make this comparison, the Board will review the prior evidence and  make an objective assessment of the annuitant's residual functional  capacity at the time of its most recent favorable medical determination,  based on the symptoms, signs and laboratory findings as they then  existed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Impairment subject to temporary remission. In some cases the  evidence shows that the annuitant's impairment(s) are subject to  temporary remission. In assessing whether medical improvement has  occurred in annuitants with this type of impairment(s), the Board will  be careful to consider the longitudinal history of the impairment(s),  including the occurrence of prior remission, and prospects for future  worsenings. Improvement in such impairment(s) that is only temporary,  i.e., less than 1 year, will not warrant a finding of medical  improvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior file cannot be located. If the prior file cannot be  located, the Board will first determine whether the annuitant is able to  now engage in substantial gainful activity based on all of his or her  current impairments. (In this way, the Board will be able to determine  that his or her disability continues at the earliest point without  addressing the often lengthy process of reconstructing prior evidence.)  If the annuitant cannot engage in substantial gainful activity  currently, his or her disability will continue unless one of the second  group of exceptions applies (see Sec. 220.179(b)).
