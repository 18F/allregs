                                Sec. 21.214  Furnishing supplies for special programs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A veteran pursuing one of the following types of  vocational rehabilitation programs is eligible for any types of supplies  listed in Sec. 21.212. The following paragraphs clarify the  applicability of the general provisions of Sec. 21.212 to these special  situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supplies furnished to veterans pursuing training in the home. VA  may furnish to veterans training in the home:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Books, tools, and supplies which schools or training  establishments that train individuals outside the home for the objective  the veteran is pursuing at home ordinarily require all students and  trainees to personally possess;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplies and equipment which are essential to the prescribed  course of training because the veteran is pursuing the course at home.  Equipment in this category consists of items which ordinarily are not  required by a school or training establishment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special equipment, such as a vise or drafting table;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supplies needed to enable the veteran to function more  independently in his or her home and community.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3104(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supplies furnished to a veteran in farm cooperative training.  The books and related training supplies which VA may furnish a veteran  in farm cooperative training depend upon the type of instruction he or  she is receiving:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When organized, group instruction is part of a veteran's course,  VA will furnish those books and supplies which the school requires all  students in the school portion of the course to own personally or on a  rental basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When all instruction is given on the veteran's farm by an  individual instructor, VA will furnish to a student only those textbooks  and other supplies which would ordinarily be required by a school.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(7))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Obtaining and maintaining employment. A veteran being furnished  employment services may receive supplies which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans to own  upon begining employment to the extent that the items were not furnished  during the period in which the veteran was training for the objective,  or the items that were furnished for training purposes are not adequate  for employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> VA determines that special equipment is necessary for the  veteran to perform his or her duties, subject to the obligation of the  employer to make reasonable accommodation to the disabling effects of  the veteran's condition.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3104(a), 4212)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Self-employment. The supplies and related assistance which may  be furnished, subject to the requirements prescribed under Sec. Sec.  21.257 and 21.258, to a veteran for whom self-employment has been  approved as the occupational objective, are generally limited to those  necessary to begin operations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum stocks of materials, e.g., inventory of saleable  merchandise or goods, expendable items required for day-to-day  operations, and items which are consumed on the premises;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Essential equipment, including machinery, occupational fixtures,  accessories, and appliances; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other related assistance such as business license fees.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(12))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Supplies and related assistance which may not be furnished for  self-employment. VA may not authorize assistance for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchase of, or part payment for, land and buildings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Making full or part payment of leases or rentals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purchase or rentals of trucks, cars, or other means of  transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stocking a farm for animal husbandry operations.
