With regard to tower cranes, ``erecting and climbing'' replaces the term ``assembly,'' and ``dismantling'' replaces the term ``disassembly.''

It compares this lifting condition to the equipment's rated capacity, and indicates to the operator the percentage of capacity at which the equipment is working. Lights, bells, or buzzers may be incorporated as a warning of an approaching overload condition.</p><p class="depth0">Load moment (or rated capacity) limiter means a system which aids the equipment operator by sensing (directly or indirectly) the overturning moment on the equipment, i.e., load multiplied by radius. It compares this lifting condition to the equipment's rated capacity, and when the rated capacity is reached, it shuts off power to those equipment functions which can increase the severity of loading on the equipment, e.g., hoisting, telescoping out, or luffing out. Typically, those functions which decrease the severity of loading on the equipment remain operational, e.g., lowering, telescoping in, or luffing in.</p><p class="depth0">Locomotive crane means a crane mounted on a base or car equipped for travel on a railroad track.</p><p class="depth0">Luffing jib limiting device is similar to a boom hoist limiting device, except that it limits the movement of the luffing jib.</p><p class="depth0">Marine hoisted personnel transfer device means a device, such as a ``transfer net,'' that is designed to protect the employees being hoisted during a marine transfer and to facilitate rapid entry into and exit from the device.

Loads are suspended from the working boom. While the working boom may be of the fixed type (horizontal or angled) or have luffing capability, it can always rotate to swing loads, either by rotating on the top of the tower (top slewing) or by the rotation of the tower (bottom slewing). The tower base may be fixed in one location or ballasted and moveable between locations. Mobile cranes that are configured with luffing jib and/or tower attachments are not considered tower cranes under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Travel bogie (tower cranes) is an assembly of two or more axles arranged to permit vertical wheel displacement and equalize the loading on the wheels.</p><p class="depth0">Trim means angle of inclination about the transverse axis of a barge, pontoons, vessel or other means of floatation.</p><p class="depth0">Two blocking means a condition in which a component that is uppermost on the hoist line such as the load block, hook block, overhaul ball, or similar component, comes in contact with the boom tip, fixed upper block or similar component.
