                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A claim for death, personal injury, or loss of or damage to property may be allowed under this subpart if the alleged damage results from noncombat activity or a negligent or wrongful act or omission of soldiers or civilian employees of the U.S. armed forces, as enumerated in Sec. 536.23(b), regardless of whether the act or omission was made within the scope of their employment. This includes non-U.S. citizen employees recruited elsewhere but employed in a country of which they are not a citizen. However, a claim generated by non-U.S. citizen employees in the country in which they were recruited and are employed will be payable only if the act or omission was made in the scope of employment. But claims arising from the operation of U.S. armed forces vehicles or other equipment by such employees may be paid, even though the employees are not acting within the scope of their employment, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable under local law in the circumstances involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims generated by officers or civilian employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission (36 U.S.C. 2110), acting within the scope of employment, will be paid from American Battle Monuments Commission appropriations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims for the loss of, or damage to, property that may be settled under this subpart include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Real property used and occupied under lease, express, implied, or otherwise. See Sec. 536.34(m) of this part and paragraph 2-15m of DA Pam 27-162.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personal property bailed to the government under an agreement, express or implied, unless the owner has expressly assumed the risk of damage or loss.</p>
