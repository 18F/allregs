Similarly, the SIP continues to exclude the exemption now in Rule 7001.1210 as applied to small sources subject to new source performance standards, and the SIP is approved only for ``existing sources'' in the case of Rules 7005.1250 through 7005.1280 (Standards of Performance for Liquid Petroleum Storage Vessels), Rules 7005.1350 through 7005.1410 (Standards of Performance for Sulfuric Acid Plants), Rules 7005.1450 through 7005.1500 (Standards of Performance for Nitric Acid Plants), and

Rules 7005.2100 through 7005.2160 (Standards of Performance for Petroleum Refineries).
