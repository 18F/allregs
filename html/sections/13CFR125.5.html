                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Certificate of Competency (COC) Program is  authorized under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.  637(b)(7)). A COC is a written instrument issued by SBA to a Government  contracting officer, certifying that one or more named small business  concerns possess(es) the responsibility to perform a specific Government  procurement (or sale) contract, which includes Multiple Award Contracts  and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts, where responsibility  type issues are used to determine award or establish the competitive  range. The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement  actions, including Multiple Award Contracts and orders placed against  Multiple Award Contracts where the contracting officer has used any  issues of capacity or credit (responsibility) to determine suitability  for an award. With respect to Multiple Award Contracts, contracting  officers generally determine responsibility at the time of award of the  contract. However, if a contracting officer makes a responsibility  determination as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for an  order issued against a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer  must refer the matter to SBA for a COC. The COC procedures apply to all  Federal procurements, regardless of the location of performance or the  location of the procuring activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer must refer a small business concern to SBA  for a possible COC, even if the next apparent successful offeror is also  a small business, when the contracting officer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Denies an apparent successful small business offeror award of a  contract or order on the basis of responsibility (including those bases  set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Refuses to consider a small business concern for award of a  contract or order after evaluating the concern's offer on a non- comparative basis (e.g., a pass/fail, go/no go, or acceptable/ unacceptable) under one or more responsibility type evaluation factors  (such as experience of the company or key personnel or past  performance); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Refuses to consider a small business concern for award of a  contract or order because it failed to meet a definitive responsibility  criterion contained in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A small business offeror referred to SBA as nonresponsible may  apply to SBA for a COC. Where the applicant is a non-manufacturing  offeror on a supply contract, the COC applies to the responsibility of  the non-manufacturer, not to that of the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> COC Eligibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The offeror seeking a COC has the burden of  proof to demonstrate its eligibility for COC review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must qualify as a small  business under the applicable size standard in accordance with part 121  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must have agreed to comply  with applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements if the  acquisition was set-aside or reserved (see Sec. 125.6). Whether an  offeror has agreed to comply with the limitations on subcontracting is a  matter of proposal acceptability or responsiveness. Whether an offeror  will be able to comply with the limitations on subcontracting is a  matter of responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonmanufacturer making an offer on a contract for supplies  that is set-aside, partially set-aside or reserved for small business  (where the small business will be competing against other small  businesses for orders) must furnish end items that have been  manufactured in the United States by a small business. A waiver of this  requirement may be requested under Secs. 121.1201 through 121.1205 of  this chapter for either the type of product being procured or the  specific contract at issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A non-manufacturer making an offer on an unrestricted  procurement or a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition threshold  procedures with a cost that does not exceed $25,000 must furnish end  items manufactured in the United States to be eligible for a COC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An offeror intending to provide a kit consisting of finished  components or other components provided for a special purpose, is  eligible if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It meets the Size Standard for the NAICS code assigned to the  procurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each component comprising the kit was manufactured in the United  States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a set-aside or reserve, each component comprising  the kit was manufactured by a small business under the size standard  applicable to the component provided. A waiver of this requirement may  be requested under Secs. 121.1301 through 121.1305 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An eligibility determination will be made on a case-by-case  basis, where a concern or any of its principals appears in the  Nonprocurement Section of the publication referred to in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Referral of nonresponsibility determination to SBA. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  contracting officer must refer the matter in writing to the SBA  Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serving the area in  which the headquarters of the offeror is located. The referral must  include a copy of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solicitation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offer submitted by the concern whose responsibility is at issue  for the procurement (its Best and Final Offer for a negotiated  procurement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Abstract of Bids, where applicable, or the Contracting  Officer's Price Negotiation Memorandum;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Preaward survey, where applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Contracting officer's written determination of  nonresponsibility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Technical data package (including drawings, specifications, and  Statement of Work); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any other justification and documentation used to arrive at  the nonresponsibility determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contract award must be withheld by the contracting officer for a  period of 15 working days (or longer if agreed to by SBA and the  contracting officer) following receipt by the appropriate Area Office of  a referral which includes all required documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The COC referral must indicate that the offeror has been found  responsive to the solicitation, and also identify the reasons for the  nonresponsibility determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application for COC. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon receipt of the contracting  officer's referral, the Area Office will inform the concern of the  contracting officer's negative responsibility determination, and offer  it the opportunity to apply to SBA for a COC by a specified date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The COC application must include all information and  documentation requested by SBA and any additional information which the  firm believes will demonstrate its ability to perform on the proposed  contract. The application should be returned as soon as possible, but no  later than the date specified by SBA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a complete and acceptable application, SBA may  elect to visit the applicant's facility to review its responsibility.  SBA personnel may obtain clarification or confirmation of information  provided by the applicant by directly contacting suppliers, financial  institutions, and other third parties upon whom the applicant's  responsibility depends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Incomplete applications. If an application for a COC is  materially incomplete or is not submitted by the date specified by SBA,  SBA will close the case without issuing a COC and will notify the  contracting officer and the concern with a declination letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reviewing an application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The COC review process is not  limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting  officer. SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC  applicant for all elements of   responsibility, but it may presume responsibility exists as to elements  other than those cited as deficient. SBA may deny a COC for reasons of  nonresponsibility not originally cited by the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A small business will be rebuttably presumed nonresponsible if  any of the following circumstances are shown to exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within three years before the application for a COC, the  concern, or any of its principals, has been convicted of an offense or  offenses that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under  FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), and the matter is still  under the jurisdiction of a court (e.g., the principals of a concern are  incarcerated, on probation or parole, or under a suspended sentence); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within three years before the application for a COC, the  concern or any of its principals has had a civil judgment entered  against it or them for any reason that would constitute grounds for  debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part, subpart  9.4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Decision by Area Director (``Director''). After reviewing the  information submitted by the applicant and the information gathered by  SBA, the Area Director will make a determination, either final or  recommended as set forth in the following chart:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">SBA official or         Finality of</p><p class="depth0">office with        decision; options</p><p class="depth0">Contracting actions        authority to make      for contracting</p><p class="depth0">decision              agencies ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $100,000 or less, or in       Director may approve  Final. The Director</p><p class="depth0">accordance with Simplified    or deny.              will notify both</p><p class="depth0">Acquisition Threshold                               applicant and</p><p class="depth0">procedures.                                         contracting agency</p><p class="depth0">in writing of the</p><p class="depth0">decision. Between $100,000 and $25      (1) Director may      (1) Final.</p><p class="depth0">million.                      deny.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracting</p><p class="depth0">approve, subject to   agency may proceed</p><p class="depth0">right of appeal and   under paragraph (h)</p><p class="depth0">other options.        or paragraph (i) of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Final.</p><p class="depth0">deny.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracting</p><p class="depth0">refer to SBA          agency may proceed</p><p class="depth0">Headquarters          under paragraph (j)</p><p class="depth0">recommendation for    of this section.</p><p class="depth0">approval. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notification of intent to issue on a contract or order with a  value between $100,000 and $25 million. Where the Director determines  that a COC is warranted, he or she will notify the contracting officer  (or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's  decision) of the intent to issue a COC, and of the reasons for that  decision, prior to issuing the COC. At the time of notification, the  contracting officer or the procurement official with the authority to  accept SBA's decision has the following options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accept the Director's decision to issue the COC and award the  contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent,  including as an attachment a detailed rationale of the decision; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ask the Director to suspend the case for one of the following  purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the  contracting officer for review within a specified period of time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To afford the contracting officer the opportunity to meet with  the Area Office to review all documentation contained in the case file;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To submit any information which the contracting officer  believes SBA has not considered (at which time, SBA will establish a new  suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and SBA); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to  SBA Headquarters under paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Appeals of Area Director determinations. For COC actions with a  value exceeding $100,000, contracting agencies may appeal a Director's  decision to issue a COC to SBA Headquarters by filing an appeal with the  Area Office processing the COC application. The Area Office must honor  the request to appeal if the contracting officer agrees to withhold  award until the appeal process is concluded. Without such an agreement  from the contracting officer, the Director must issue the COC.   When such an agreement has been obtained, the Area Office will  immediately forward the case file to SBA Headquarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The intent of the appeal procedure is to allow the contracting  agency the opportunity to submit to SBA Headquarters any documentation  which the Area Office may not have considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the Director,  OSDBU or OSBP of the procuring agency, with a copy to the contracting  officer, that the case file has been received and that an appeal  decision may be requested by an authorized official. If the contracting  agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters  through its Director, OSDBU, within 10 working days (or a time period  agreed upon by both agencies) of its receipt of the notice under  paragraph (h) of this section. The appeal and any supporting  documentation must be filed within 10 working days (or a different time  period agreed to by both agencies) after SBA receives the request for a  formal appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The SBA Director, Office of Government Contracting (D/GC) will  make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the COC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Decision by SBA Headquarters where contract value exceeds $25  million. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to taking final action, SBA Headquarters will contact  the contracting agency at the secretariat level or agency equivalent and  afford it the following options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ask SBA Headquarters to suspend the case so that the agency can  meet with Headquarters personnel and review all documentation contained  in the case file; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submit to SBA Headquarters for evaluation any information which  the contracting agency believes has not been considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After reviewing all available information, the AA/GC will make a  final decision to either issue or deny the COC. If the AA/GC's decision  is to deny the COC, the applicant and contracting agency will be  informed in writing by the Area Office. If the decision is to issue the  COC, a letter certifying the responsibility of the firm will be sent to  the contracting agency by Headquarters and the applicant will be  informed of such issuance by the Area Office. Except as set forth in  paragraph (l) of this section, there can be no further appeal or  reconsideration of the decision of the AA/GC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Notification of denial of COC. The notification to an  unsuccessful applicant following either an Area Director or a  Headquarters denial of a COC will briefly state all reasons for denial  and inform the applicant that a meeting may be requested with  appropriate SBA personnel to discuss the denial. Upon receipt of a  request for such a meeting, the appropriate SBA personnel will confer  with the applicant and explain the reasons for SBA's action. The meeting  does not constitute an opportunity to rebut the merits of the SBA's  decision to deny the COC, and is for the sole purpose of giving the  applicant the opportunity to correct deficiencies so as to improve its  ability to obtain future contracts either directly or, if necessary,  through the issuance of a COC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Reconsideration of COC after issuance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An approved COC may  be reconsidered and possibly rescinded, at the sole discretion of SBA,  where an award of the contract has not occurred, and one of the  following circumstances exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The COC applicant submitted false or omitted materially adverse  information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New materially adverse information has been received relating  to the current responsibility of the applicant concern; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case  SBA may investigate the business concern's current circumstances and the  reason why the contract has not been issued).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC the procedures under  paragraph (h) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Effect of a COC. By the terms of the Act, a COC is conclusive as  to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC on behalf of a small business  with respect to a particular contract, contracting officers are required  to award the contract without requiring the firm to meet any other  requirement with respect to responsibility. Where   SBA issues a COC with respect to a referral in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or  (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the contracting officer is not required to  issue an award to that offeror if the contracting officer denies the  contract for reasons unrelated to responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Effect of Denial of COC. Denial of a COC by SBA does not  preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred  firm, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other  procurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Monitoring performance. Once a COC has been issued and a  contract awarded on that basis, SBA will monitor contractor performance.
