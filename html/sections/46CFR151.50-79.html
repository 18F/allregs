If the piping system for the tanks to be loaded with methyl acetylene-propadiene mixture is not independent, the required piping separation must be accomplished by the removal of spool pieces, valves or other pipe sections and the installation of blank flanges at these locations. The required separation applies to all liquid and vapor piping, liquid and vapor vent lines and any other possible connections, such as common inert gas supply lines.
