                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Except as provided in 47 CFR 90.617(k), unacceptable  interference to non-cellular part 90 licensees in the 800 MHz band from  cellular radiotelephone or part 90-800 MHz cellular systems will be  deemed to occur when the below conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A median desired signal of -104 dBm or higher, as measured at  the R.F. input of the receiver of a mobile unit; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A median desired signal of -101 dBm or higher, as measured at  the R.F. input of the receiver of a portable i.e. hand-held unit; and,  either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is a voice transceiver:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> With manufacturer published performance specifications for the  receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum  standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, below; and;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the  measured Carrier to Noise plus interference (C/(I + N)) ratio of the  receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB, or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or  signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some  comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to  be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or  portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in  paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed  subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median  desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power  in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to  account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward  adjustment shall be equal to the increase in   the desired signal required to restore the receiver section of the  subject transceiver to the 20 dB C/(I + N) ratio of paragraph  (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted threshold levels shall then  define the minimum measured signal power(s) in lieu of paragraphs  (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee using such non-compliant  transceiver is entitled to interference protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum receiver requirements. Voice transceivers capable of  operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band shall have the  following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in  which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection  against unacceptable interference (See paragraph (a) (2) of this  section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation  rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm  reference sensitivity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Voice units intended for portable use: 70 dB intermodulation  rejection ratio; 70 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm  reference sensitivity.
