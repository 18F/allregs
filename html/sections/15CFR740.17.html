Eligible items are those classified under ECCNs 5A002.a.1, .a.2, .a.5, .a.6, .a.9, or .b, ECCN 5B002, and equivalent or related software and technology classified under ECCNs 5D002 or 5E002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligible End-users. Eligible end-users are ``private sector end-users'' wherever located that are headquartered in a country listed in Supplement No. 3 of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(1)(ii): A ``private sector end-user'' is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual who is not acting on behalf of any foreign government; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A commercial firm (including its subsidiary and parent firms, and other subsidiaries of the same parent) that is not wholly owned by, or otherwise controlled by or acting on behalf of, any foreign government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligible End-use. The eligible end-use is internal ``development'' or ``production'' of new products by those end-users.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(1)(iii): All items produced or developed with items exported or reexported under this paragraph (a)(1) are subject to the EAR. These items may require the submission of a classification request or encryption registration before sale, reexport or transfer, unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exports and reexports to ``U.S. Subsidiaries.'' License Exception ENC authorizes export and reexport of systems, equipment, commodities and components therefor classified under ECCNs 5A002.a.1, .a.2, .a.5, .a.6, .a.9, or .b, systems, equipment, and components therefor classified under ECCN 5B002, and equivalent or related software and technology classified under ECCNs 5D002 or 5E002, to any ``U.S. subsidiary,'' wherever located without submission of an encryption registration, classification request, self-classification report or sales report to BIS. License Exception ENC also authorizes export or reexport of such items by a U.S. company and its subsidiaries to

foreign nationals who are employees, contractors or interns of a U.S. company or its subsidiaries if the items are for internal company use, including the ``development'' or ``production'' of new products, without prior review by the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(2): All items produced or developed with items exported or reexported under this paragraph (a)(2) are subject to the EAR. These items may require the submission of a classification request or encryption registration before sale, reexport or transfer to non-``U.S. subsidiaries,'' unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Encryption registration required, with classification request or self-classification report. Exports and reexports authorized under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of License Exception ENC require submission of an encryption registration in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and the specific instructions of paragraph (r)(1) of Supplement No. 2 to part 748 of the EAR. For items self-classified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from June 25, 2010 through August 24, 2010, and for requests for classification under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section submitted from June 25, 2010 through August 24, 2010, exporters have until August 24, 2010 to submit their encryption registrations. In addition: for paragraph (b)(1) of this section a self-classification report in accordance with Sec. 742.15(c) of the EAR is also required from specified exporters and reexporters; for paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a thirty-day (30-day) classification request is required in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (f) of this section for grandfathering provisions applicable to certain encryption items reviewed and classified by BIS under this license exception prior to June 25, 2010. Only License Exception ENC authorizations under this paragraph (b) to a company that has fulfilled the requirements of encryption registration (such as the producer of the item) authorize the export and reexport of the company's encryption items by all persons, wherever located, under this license exception. When an exporter or reexporter relies on the producer's self-classification (pursuant to the producer's encryption registration) or CCATS for an encryption item eligible for export or reexport under License Exception ENC under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, it is not required to submit an encryption registration, classification request or self-classification report. Exporters are still required to comply with semi-annual sales reporting requirements under paragraph (e) of this section, even if relying on a CCATS issued to a producer for specified encryption items described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Immediate authorization. Once an encryption registration is submitted to BIS in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and an Encryption Registration Number (ERN) has been issued, this paragraph (b)(1) authorizes the exports or reexports of the associated commodities classified under ECCNs 5A002.a.1, .a.2, .a.5, .a.6, .a.9, or .b, or ECCN 5B002, and equivalent or related software classified under ECCN 5D002, except any such commodities, software or components described in (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, subject to submission of a self-classification report in accordance with Sec. 742.15(c) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Classification request required. Thirty (30) days after the submission of a classification request with BIS in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and subject to the reporting requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph under License Exception ENC authorizes certain exports or reexports of the items submitted for classification, as further described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Note to introductory text of paragraph (b)(2): Immediately after the classification request is submitted to BIS in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and subject to the reporting requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph also authorizes exports or reexports of:</p><p class="depth0">1.
