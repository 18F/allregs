In the absence of receipt of such certification from the producer or entity controlling production, an importer of articles described in Sec. 10.843(a) of this subpart for which duty-free treatment is sought under this subpart must enter the articles under subheading 9820.61.25, HTSUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrected claim.

A corrected claim will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the CBP port where the claim was originally filed.
