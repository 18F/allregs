                            <p class="depth0">The petitioner shall provide the following information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A set of proposed test procedures for S28.1, S28.2, S28.3, and  S28.4 of Standard No. 208 which the petitioner believes are appropriate  for assessing a particular DASS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For S28.1 of Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall specify at  least one specific position for the Part 572, subpart O 5th percentile  female dummy that is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outside but adjacent to the ASZ, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Representative of an unbelted occupant position that is likely  to occur during a frontal crash.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For S28.2 of Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall specify at  least one specific position for the Part 572 Subpart P 3-year-old child  dummy and at least one specific position for the Part 572 Subpart N 6- year-old child dummy that are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outside but adjacent to the ASZ, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Representative of unbelted occupant positions that are likely  to occur during a frontal crash where pre-crash braking occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For S28.3 of Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall specify a  procedure which tests the operation of the DASS by moving a test device  toward the driver air bag in a manner that simulates the motion of an  unbelted occupant during pre-crash braking or other pre-crash maneuver.  The petitioner shall include a complete description, including drawings  and instrumentation, of the test device employed in the proposed test.  The petitioner shall include in the procedure a means for determining  whether the driver air bag was suppressed before any portion of the  specified test device entered the ASZ during the test. The procedure  shall also include a means of determining when the specified test device  occupies the ASZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For S28.4 of Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall specify a  procedure which tests the operation of the DASS by moving a test device  toward the passenger air bag in a manner that simulates the motion of an  unbelted occupant during pre-crash braking or   other pre-crash maneuver. The petitioner shall include a complete  description, including drawings and instrumentation, of the test device  employed in the proposed test. The petitioner shall include in the  procedure a means for determining whether the passenger air bag was  suppressed before any portion of the specified test device entered the  ASZ during the test. The procedure shall also include a means of  determining when the specified test device occupies the ASZ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A complete description and explanation of the particular DASS  that the petitioner believes will be appropriately assessed by the  recommended test procedures. This shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the logic used by the DASS in determining  whether to suppress the air bag or allow it to deploy. Such description  shall include flow charts or similar materials outlining the operation  of the system logic, the system reaction time, the time duration used to  evaluate whether the air bag should be suppressed or deployed, changes,  if any, in system performance based on the size of an occupant and  vehicle speed, and a description of the size and shape of the zone where  under similar circumstances and conditions the DASS may either allow or  suppress deployment. Such description shall also address whether and how  the DASS discriminates between an occupant's torso or head entering the  ASZ as compared to an occupant's hand or arm, and whether and how the  DASS discriminates between an occupant entering the ASZ and an inanimate  object such as a newspaper or ball entering the ASZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detailed specifications for the size and shape of the ASZ,  including whether the suppression zone is designed to change size or  shape depending on the vehicle speed, occupant size, or other factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analysis and data supporting the appropriateness, repeatability,  reproducibility and practicability of each of the proposed test  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the procedures proposed for inclusion in S28.1 and S28.2 of  Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall provide the basis for the  proposed dummy positions, including but not limited to, why the  positions are representative of what is likely to occur in real world  crashes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the procedures proposed for inclusion in S28.3 and S28.4 of  Standard No. 208, the petitioner shall provide:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A complete explanation of the means used in the proposed test to  ascertain whether the air bag is suppressed or activated during the  test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A complete description of the means used to evaluate the  ability of the DASS to detect and respond to an occupant moving toward  an air bag, including the method used to move a test device toward an  air bag at speeds representative of occupant movement during pre-crash  braking or other pre-crash maneuver.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The procedure used for locating the test device inside a test  vehicle in preparation for testing, including an accounting of the  reference points used to specify such location.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An explanation of the methods used to measure the amount of  time needed by a suppression system to suppress an air bag once a  suppression triggering event occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> High speed film or video of at least two tests of the DASS using  the proposed test procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Data generated from not less than two tests of the DASS using  the proposed test procedure, including an account of the data streams  monitored during testing and complete samples of these data streams from  not less than two tests performed under the proposed procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Analysis concerning the variety of potential DASS designs for  which the requested test procedure is appropriate; e.g., whether the  test procedures are appropriate only for the specific DASS design  contemplated by the petitioner, for all DASS designs incorporating the  same technologies, or for all DASS designs.</p>
