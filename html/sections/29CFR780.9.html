                                Sec. 780.9  Related exemptions are interpreted together.

                            <p class="depth0">The interpretations contained in the several subparts of this part  780 consider separately a number of exemptions which affect employees  who perform activities in or connected with agriculture and its  products. These exemptions deal with related subject matter and varying  degrees of relationships between them were the subject of consideration  in Congress before their enactment. Together they constitute an  expression in some detail of existing Federal policy on the lines to be  drawn in the industries connected with agriculture and agricultural  products between those employees to whom the pay provisions of the Act  are to be applied and those whose exclusion in whole or in part from the  Act's requirements has been deemed justified. The courts have indicated  that these exemptions, because of their relationship to one another,  should be construed together insofar as possible so that they form a  consistent whole. Consideration of the language and history of a related  exemption or exemptions is helpful in ascertaining the intended scope  and application of an exemption whose effect might otherwise not be  clear (Addison v. Holly Hill, 322 U.S. 607; Maneja v. Waialua, 349 U.S.  254; Bowie v. Gonzales (C.A. 1), 117 F. 2d 11). In the interpretations  of the several exemptions discussed in the various subparts of this part  780, effect has been given to these principles and each exemption has  been considered in its relation to others in the group as well as to the  combined effect of the group as a whole.</p>
