Strict or absolute liability and similar theories are not grounds for liability under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tort claims arising out of noncombat activities. Claims arising out of noncombat activities under Sec. Sec. 536.75(a)(2) and (b) are not tort claims and require only proof of causation. However, the doctrine of contributory negligence will apply, to the extent set forth in 10

Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or similar harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for the purposes of determining the extent of liability. If the claim accrued prior to September 1, 1995, these limitations do not apply. Any such limitation in the law of the place of occurrence will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personal injury claims--(1) Eligible claimants.
