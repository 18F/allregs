The return must be filed by the  grantor or the transferor, or the fiduciary of the estate in the case of  a testamentary trust. The return must be filed whether or not any  beneficiary is a United States person and whether or not the grantor or  any other person may be treated as the substantial owner of any portion  of the trust under sections 671-678.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Meaning of terms.

The term ``grantor'' refers to any United States person  who by an inter vivos declaration or agreement creates a foreign trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transferor. The term ``transferor'' refers to any United States  person, other than a person who is the grantor or the fiduciary (as  defined in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph), who transfers money or  property to or for the benefit of a foreign trust. It does not refer to  a person who transfers money or property to a foreign trust pursuant to  a sale or an exchange which is made for full and adequate consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fiduciary of an estate. In the case of a testamentary trust  expressed in the will of a decedent the term ``fiduciary of an estate''  refers to the executor or administrator who is responsible for  establishing a foreign trust on behalf of the decedent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information required.

If  a United States person transfers money or property to the same foreign  trust at different times, then separate returns must be filed with  respect to each transfer where returns are required under section 6048  and this section. However, where more than one transfer to the same  foreign trust is made by a United States person during any 90-day  period, such person may, at his election, file a single return, so long  as the return includes the information required with respect to each  transfer and is filed on or before the 90th day after the earliest  transfer in any such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Joint returns.

Sec. 16A.126-1  Certain cost-sharing payments--in general.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. In general, section 126 provides that recipients  of payments made after September 30, 1979 under certain conservation,  reclamation and restoration programs may exclude all or a portion of  those payments from income if the payments do not substantially increase  the annual income derived by the taxpayer from the affected property.  For purposes of this section, the term ``payment'' as used in section  126 means payment of the economic benefit, if any, conferred upon the  taxpayer upon receipt of the improvement. An increase in annual income  is substantial if it exceeds the greater of 10 percent of the average  annual income derived from the affected property prior to receipt of the  improvement or an amount equal to $2.50 times the number of affected  acres. The amount of gross income which a taxpayer realizes upon the  receipt of a section 126 payment is the value of the section 126  improvement, reduced by the sum of the excludable portion and the  taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement (if any).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Cost of the improvement'' means the sum of amounts paid by a  government and the taxpayer, whether or not with borrowed funds, for the  improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Section 126 cost'' means the cost of the improvement less the  sum of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any government payments under a program which is not listed in  section 126(a),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any portion of a government payment under a program which is  listed in section 126(a) which the Secretary of Agriculture has not  certified is primarily for purposes of conservation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any government payment to the taxpayer which is in the nature  of rent or compensation for services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Value of the section 126 improvement'' means the fair market  value of the improvement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the section 126 cost and the denominator of which is the cost  of the improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ``Affected acreage'' means the acres affected by the  improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> ``Excludable portion'' means the present fair market value of  the right to receive annual income from the affected acreage of the  greater of 10 percent of the prior average annual income from the  affected acreage or $2.50 times the number of affected acres.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> ``Prior average annual income'' means the average of the gross  receipts from the affected acreage for the last three taxable years  preceding the taxable year in which installation of the improvement is  commenced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> ``Section 126 improvement'' means the portion of the improvement  equal to the percentage which government payments made to the taxpayer,  which the Secretary of Agriculture has certified were made primarily for  the purpose of conservation, bear to the cost of the improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Income realized upon receipt of a section 126 improvement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Section 126 exclusion applied. Unless a taxpayer elects not to have  section 126 apply, the amount of gross income realized on receipt of the  section 126 improvement is the value of the section 126 improvement less  the sum of the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement and the  excludable portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 126 exclusion not applied. If a taxpayer elects under  section 126(c) not to have section 126 apply in whole or in part, the  amount realized on the receipt of the section 126 improvement is the  value of the section 126 improvement less the sum of the taxpayer's  share of the cost of the improvement and the excludable portion that  applies, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payments under watershed programs--(1) Programs within section  126(a)(9). Section 126(a)(9) covers certain programs affecting small  watersheds.  These programs must be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and  be determined by the Commissioner to be substantially similar to the  type of program described in section 126(a) (1)   through (8). The Commissioner has determined that section 126  improvements made in connection with small watersheds are within the  scope of section 126(a)(9) if they are made under one of the following  programs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, Pub. L. 566,  68 Stat. 666, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.), as funded by the Act  of November 9, 1979, Pub. L. 96-108, 93 Stat. 834.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Flood Prevention Projects, Pub.

The Commissioner may announce further  determinations under section 126(a)(9) from time to time in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Small watershed defined. A watershed is a ``small watershed''  under this paragraph and section 126(a)(9) if the watershed or  subwatershed does not exceed 250,000 acres and does not include any  single structure providing more than 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater  detention capacity, nor more than 25,000 acre-feet of total capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Basis of property not increased by reason of excludable amounts.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 1016 (relating to adjustments  to basis) to the contrary, basis of any property does not include any  amount which is excludable from gross income under section 126.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Cross reference. For rules relating to the recapture as ordinary  income of the gain from the disposition (within 20 years of the date of  receipt) of property for which an exclusion is claimed for a section 126  improvement, see section 1255 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). In 1981, 100 acres of the taxpayer's land is reclaimed  under a Rural Abandoned Mine Program contract with the Soil Conservation  Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The total cost of the  improvement is $700,000. USDA pays $690,000, the taxpayer $10,000. The  Secretary of Agriculture certifies that 95% of the $690,000 USDA payment  was primarily for the purpose of conservation. Therefore, $34,500  ($690,000x.05) is a nonsection 126 payment. $150,000 of USDA's payment  is compensation for the taxpayer's service in the reclamation project  and is includable in gross income as compensation for services. The  taxpayer has $20,000 of allowable deductions in 1981, $15,500 of which  are properly attributable to the USDA payment. Based on all the facts  and circumstances, the value of the improvement is $21,000. The taxpayer  elects not to have section 126 apply. The taxpayer computes the amount  which is included in gross income as a result of receipt of the  improvement as follows:  (1)</p><p class="depth0">Cost of improvement.........................................   $700,000</p><p class="depth0">Nonsection 126 payment....................................    (34,500)</p><p class="depth0">Compensation for services.................................   (150,000)</p><p class="depth0">Current deductions........................................    (15,500)</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Section 126 cost........................................    500,000</p><p class="depth0">=========== (2)</p><p class="depth0">Value of improvement........................................     21,000</p><p class="depth0">Multiplied by section 126 cost............................   x500,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Cost of improvement.......................................    700,000</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Value of section 126 improvement........................     15,000</p><p class="depth0">=========== (3)</p><p class="depth0">Value of section 126 improvement............................     15,000 (Taxpayer's contribution)...................................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">===========</p><p class="depth0">Amount included in gross income.........................      5,000</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as example (1) except that  section 126 applies. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the  present fair market value of the right to receive annual income from the  property of 10 percent of the prior average annual income of the  affected acreage prior to the receipt of the improvement is $1,380 and  the present fair market value of the right to receive $250 ($2.50 x 100  acres) is $1,550. The excludable portion is, therefore, $1,550. The  taxpayer computes the amount included in gross income as follows:  Value of section 126 improvement............................    $15,000 (Taxpayer's contribution)...................................    (10,000) (Excludable portion)........................................     (1,550)</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Amount included in income................................      3,450</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). The facts are the same as example (2) except that the  present value of 10 percent of the prior average annual income is  $5,600. The taxpayer realizes no income as a result of receipt of the  section 126 project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Value of section 126 improvement............................    $15,000 (Taxpayer's contribution)...................................    (10,000)</p><p class="depth0">(Excludable portion)........................................     (5,600)</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Amount included in income................................          0</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). In 1983, the taxpayer signs a contract under the water  bank program under which he will maintain 20 acres of undisturbed  wetlands as a wildfowl preserve. In return he will receive $90 an acre  as rent from the government. Although the payment is made under a  program listed in section 126(a) and the Secretary of Agriculture has  certified that the entire amount of payment was made primarily for the  purpose of conservation, there is no income eligible for section 126  exclusion because the full payment is rent. The rent is included in full  in gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example (5). In 1980, the taxpayer reforests 200 acres of  nonindustrial private forest land by planting tree seedlings. The  taxpayer pays the full cost of the reforestation, $15,000. Under the  cost-sharing provisions of the forestry incentives program, the taxpayer  receives a reimbursement from USDA of $12,000. The Secretary of  Agriculture certifies that 100% of the USDA payment is primarily for the  purpose of conservation. Assume that the excludable portion is $3,500  and that based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of the  improvement is $15,000. The amount which is includable in income is the  value of the section 126 improvement, reduced by the excludable portion  and the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement. Therefore the  taxpayer includes $8,500 in gross income as a result of the USDA  payment, computed as follows:  Value of the section 126 improvement....................      $15,000 (Excludable portion)....................................      (3,500) (Taxpayer's contribution)...............................      (3,000)</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">Amount included in gross income......................        8,500</p><p class="depth0">[T.D. 7748, 46 FR 27637, May 21, 1981; 46 FR 41043, Aug. 14, 1981]    Sec. 16A.126-2  Section 126 elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election for section 126 not to apply in whole or in part. A  taxpayer may elect under section 126(c) not to have section 126 apply to  all or any part of an improvement described in section 126.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of the section 126 exclusion. To the extent the  section 126 exclusion applies, the taxpayer should so indicate on an  attachment to the tax return (or amended return) for the taxable year in  which the taxpayer received the last payment made by a government for  the improvement. The attachment should state the dollar amount of the  section 126 cost funded by a government payment, the value of the  section 126 improvement, and the amount that the taxpayer is excluding  under section 126.

For special rules with respect to the application of section  1255, see Sec. 16A.1255-2. For the relation of section 1255 to other  provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Meaning of terms. For purposes of section 1255 and these  regulations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``section 126 property'' means any property acquired,  improved, or otherwise modified as a result of a payment listed in  section 126(a) which has been certified by the Secretary of Agriculture  as primarily for the purpose of conservation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``excludable portion'' is defined in Sec. 16A.126- 1(b)(5);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term ``disposition'' has the same meaning as in Sec.  1.1245-1(a)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term ``date of receipt of the section 126 payment'' means  the last date the government made a payment for the improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicable percentage. If section 126 property is disposed of  less than 10   years after the date of receipt of the last payment which has been  certified by the Secretary of Agriculture as primarily for the purpose  of conservation, the ``applicable percentage'' is 100 percent; if  section 126 property is disposed of more than 10 years after that date,  the applicable percentage is 100 percent reduced (but not below zero) by  10 percent for each year or part thereof in excess of 10 years such  property was held after the date of the section 126 payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> relating to gain from  disposition of certain depreciable property. If (i) only a portion of a  parcel of section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction, or if  two or more portions of a single parcel are disposed of in one  transaction, and (ii) the aggregate of ``excludable portions'' with  respect to any such portion cannot be established to the satisfaction of  the Commissioner, then the aggregate of the ``excludable portions'' in  respect of the entire parcel shall be allocated to each portion in  proportion to the fair market value of each at the time of the  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instances of nonapplication--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 1255 does  not apply if a taxpayer disposes of section 126 property more than 20  years after receipt of the last section 126 payment with respect to the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Losses. Section 1255(a)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus,  section 1255(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale,  exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is section  126 property, nor does the section apply to a disposition of the  property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion  if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of the property  is not greater than its adjusted basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relation of section 1255 to other provisions--(1) General. The  provisions of section 1255 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of  Subtitle A of the Code except that they do not apply to the extent gain  is recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of  Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or  limitation under Sec. 16A.1255-2 applies, gain under section 1255(a)(1)  is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or  income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1255  overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or  business), the gain recognized under section 1255 upon a disposition of  section 126 property will be treated as ordinary income and only the  remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain  from the sale or exchange of property to which section 1231 applies. See  example </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonrecognition sections overridden. The nonrecognition of gain  provisions of Subtitle A of the Code which section 1255 overrides  include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, and  512(b)(5). See Sec. 16A.1255-2 for the extent to which section  1255(a)(1) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721, 731,  1031, and 1033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Installment method. Gain from a disposition to which section  1255(a)(1) applies may be reported under the installment method if such  method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such a  case, the portion of the installment payment that is gain is treated as  follows: first as ordinary gain under other sections of Chapter I  Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code until all that gain has been reported;  next as ordinary gain to which section 1255 applies until all that gain  is reported; and finally as gain under other sections of Chapter I,  Subchapter D, Part IV of the Code. For treatment of amounts as interest  on certain deferred payments, see section 483.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exempt income. With regard to exempt income, the principles of  Sec. 1.1245-6(e) shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1255(a)(1). For  treatment of gain not recognized under this section, the principles of  Sec. 1.1245-6(f) shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Individual A uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On  April 10, 1995, A   sells for $75,000 section 126 property with an adjusted basis of $52,500  for a realized gain of $22,500. The excludable portion under section 126  was $18,000. A received the section 126 payment on January 5, 1990. No  gain is recognized as ordinary gain under sections 1231 through 1254.  Because the applicable percentage, 100 percent, of the aggregate of the  section 126 improvements ($18,000), $18,000, is lower than the gain  realized, $22,500, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income  under section 1255(a)(1) is $18,000. The remaining $4,500 of the gain  may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described  in section 1231.    Sec. 16A.1255-2  Special rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> upon a disposition of section 126  property by gift. For purposes of section 1255 and this paragraph, the  term ``gift'' shall have the same meaning as in Sec. 1.1245-4(a) and,  with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles  illustrated by the examples of Sec. 1.1245-4(a)(2) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift. Where  a disposition of section 126 property is in part a sale or exchange and  in part a gift, the amount of gain which shall be recognized as ordinary  income under section 1255(a)(1) shall be computed under Sec. 16A.1255- 1(a)(1), applied by treating the gain realized (for purposes of Sec.  16A.1255-1(a)(1)(ii)), as the excess of the amount realized over the  adjusted basis of the section 126 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of section 126 property in hands of transferee. See  paragraph (d) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the  case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). On March 2, 1986, A makes a gift to B of a parcel of  land having an adjusted basis of $40,000 and fair market value of  $65,000. On the date of that gift, the aggregate of excludable portions  under section 126 was $24,000. The section 126 payments were all  received on January 15, 1981. Upon making the gift, A recognizes no gain  under section 1255(a)(1). See paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For  treatment of the property in the hands of B, see example (1) of  paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in example (1), except  that A transfers the land to B for $50,000. Assume further that no gain  is recognized as ordinary income under any other provision of Chapter I,  Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Thus, the gain realized is $10,000  (amount realized, $50,000, minus adjusted basis, $40,000), and A has  made a gift of $15,000 (fair market value, $65,000, minus amount  realized, $50,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon the transfer of the land to B, A recognizes $10,000 as  ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1), computed under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section as follows:  (1) Aggregate of excludable portions under section 126.....      $24,000 (2) Multiply: Applicable percentage for land disposed if             100</p><p class="depth0">within sixth year after section 126 payments were received (3) Amount in Sec. 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(i)...................      $24,000</p><p class="depth0">============ (4) Gain realized (see (i) of this example)................       10,000 (5) Amount in Sec. 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(ii) applied in              10,000</p><p class="depth0">accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section..........</p><p class="depth0">============ (6) Lower of line (3) or line (5)..........................       10,000</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the entire gain realized on the transfer, $10,000, is  recognized as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0">For treatment of the farm land in the hands of B, see example (2) of  paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception for transfer at death--(1) In general. Except as  provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent),  no gain shall be recognized under section 1255(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> upon a transfer at  death. For purposes of section 1255 and this paragraph, the term  ``transfer at death'' shall have the same meaning as in Sec. 1.1245- 4(b) and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles  illustrated by the examples of Sec. 1.1245-4(b)(2) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of section 126 property in hands of transferee. If, as  of the date a person acquires section 126 property from a decedent, the  person's basis is determined by reason of the application of section  1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on  the date of the decedent's death, or on the applicable date provided in  section 2032 (relating to alternative valuation date), then on that date  the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 in the hands of  such transferee is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> shall  apply. Thus, in the case of a transfer of section 126 property and other  property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of  the section 126 property (as determined in a manner consistent with the  principles of Sec. 1.1245-1(a)(5)) shall consist of that portion of the  fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio  to the fair market value of the acquired property as the amount realized  from the disposition of the section 126 property bears to the total  amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for  purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without  regard to section 1255) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary  income under section 1255(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. The provisions of this paragraph do not  apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a  cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax  imposed by Chapter I of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfers covered. The transfers referred to in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section are transfers of section 126 property in which the basis  of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by  reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the  application of any of the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation  of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For  application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section to such a complete  liquidation, the principles of Sec. 1.1245-4(c)(3) shall apply. Thus,  for example, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not  apply to a liquidating distribution of section 126 property by an 80- percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's  basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by  reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled  by the transferor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  corporate reorganizations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain  railroad reorganizations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange  for a partnership interest).

See paragraph (d) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the  case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). On January 4, 1986, A holds a parcel of property that  is section 126 property having an adjusted basis of $15,000 and a fair  market value of $40,000. On that date he transfers the parcel to  corporation M in exchange for stock in the corporation worth $40,000 in  a transaction qualifying under section 351. On the date of the transfer,  the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 with respect to  the transferred property is $18,000 and all of such amount was received  on March 25, 1981. With regard to section 1255, A would recognize no  gain under section 351 upon the transfer and M's basis for the land  would be determined under section 362(a) by reference to its basis in  the hands of A. Thus, as a result of the disposition, no gain is  recognized as ordinary income under section 1255 by A since the amount  of gain recognized under that section is limited to the amount of gain  which is recognized under section 351 (determined without regard to  section 1255). See paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For treatment of  the section 126 property in the hands of B, see paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Assume the same facts in example (1), except that A  transferred the property to M for stock in the corporation   worth $32,000 and $8,000 cash. The gain realized is $25,000 (amount  realized, $40,000, minus adjusted basis, $15,000). Without regard to  section 1255, A would recognize $8,000 of gain under section 351(b).  Assume further that no gain is recognized as ordinary income under the  other provisions of Chapter I, Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code.  Therefore, since the applicable percentage, 100 percent of the aggregate  excludable portions under section 126, $18,000, is lower than the gain  realized, $25,000, the amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary  income under section 1255(a)(1) would be $18,000 if the provisions of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply. Since under section  351(b) gain in the amount of $8,000 would be recognized to the  transferor without regard to section 1255, the limitation provided in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section limits the gain taken into account by A  under section 1255(a)(1) to $8,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that  $5,000 of gain is recognized as ordinary income under section  1251(c)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under  section 1255(a)(1) is $3,000 computed as follows:  (1) Amount of gain under section 1255(a)(1) (determined</p><p class="depth0">without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Aggregate of excludable portions under section 126.....    $18,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiply: Applicable percentage for property disposed          100</p><p class="depth0">of within the fifth year after section 126 payments were</p><p class="depth0">received (percent)........................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount in Sec. 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(i)...................    $18,000</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gain realized (amount realized $40,000 less adjusted       $25,000</p><p class="depth0">basis, $15,000)...........................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Lower of line (c) or line (d)..........................    $18,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (2) Limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gain recognized (determined without regard to section       $8,000</p><p class="depth0">1255).....................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section     $5,000</p><p class="depth0">1251(c)(1)................................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>......................     $3,000</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the entire gain recognized under section 351(b) (determined  without regard to sections 1251 and 1255), $8,000, is recognized as  ordinary income since that amount is equal to the sum of the gain  recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $5,000, and  under section 1255(a)(1), $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of section 126 property received by a transferee in a  disposition by gift and certain tax-free transactions--(1) General rule.

Upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee, the dates  of receipt of section 126 payments remain the same in the hands of the  transferee as they were in the hands of the transferor. With respect to  the 175 and 182 deductions taken by the transferee, the holding period  shall not include the holding period of the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). Assume the same facts as in example (1) of paragraph  (a)(4) of this section. Therefore, on the date B receives the land in  the gift transaction, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the  aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 in respect of the  land in the hands of B is the amount in the hands of A, $24,000, and for  purposes of applying section 1255 upon a subsequent disposition by B  (including a computation of the applicable percentage) the date the  section 126 payments were received is the same as it was when the  property was in A's hands (January 15, 1981).</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (2) of paragraph  (a)(4) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the  aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 which pass over to B  for purposes of section 1255 is $14,000 ($24,000 excluded   under section 126 minus $10,000 gain recognized under section 1255(d)(1)  in accordance with example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section). The  date the section 126 payments were received is the same as when the  property was in B's hands (January 15, 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Disposition of section 126 property not specifically covered. If  section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction not specifically  covered under Sec. 16A.1255-1, and this section, then the principles of  section 1245 shall apply.</p>
