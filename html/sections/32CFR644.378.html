Sec. 644.326 through 644.332, will be returned to the Federal  agency from which it was obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When it is determined by the DE that land obtained by permit, or  other form of instrument, from another Federal agency on a temporary  basis has been substantially improved while being utilized by the  Department, the DE will request DAEN-REM to determine whether the land  is excess, or is expected to become excess, to the requirements of the  agency from which it was obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the agency from which the land was obtained advises that the  land is excess, or is expected to become excess, to its requirements,  the improvements will be reported to GSA on SF 118 in accordance with  the procedure described in Sec. Sec. 644.348 through 644.347, with a  statement that the agency from which the land was obtained has advised  that the land is excess, or is expected to become excess to its  requirements, and that the agency will be or has been requested to  reassume administrative control over the land. Coincident with the  report of excess, action will be initiated to return the land to the  agency from which it was obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency from which the land was obtained advises that the  land is not excess, and is not expected to become excess to its  requirements, improvements constructed thereon while the property was  being utilized by the Department will be disposed of in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 644.381. Where the improvements are substantial,  and cannot be utilized effectively by the agency from which the land was  obtained, and it appears that the best interests of the Government may  not be served by disposal of the improvements for removal from the site,  a report, with recommendations, should be forwarded to DAEN-REM for a  determination whether the permit and improvements should be reported to  GSA for disposal, or whether other action would be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Chief of Engineers, or his duly authorized representatives,  will execute and deliver necessary papers effecting the relinquishment  of permits and the transfer of real property to other Federal agencies  when the installations to which such real property or permits pertain  have been determined   to be excess. However, where permits were obtained at local level, DEs  will effect relinquishment in the same manner. Unless otherwise  instructed, no action will be taken by the DE to restore or return the  lands pertaining to an industrial installation to the agency which  granted the permit. DEs will, however, submit the report required in  Sec. 644.379.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where an installation embraces lands acquired in fee by a  military department and lands acquired for temporary use from other  departments or agencies, and if return of the latter type of lands to  the department or agency which granted the permit would destroy the  integrity of the installation or affect its ultimate disposal as a unit,  a report will be made to DAEN-REM with recommendations that they will  provide disposition instructions.</p>
