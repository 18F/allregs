Financial performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor supplements the information provided in this Item 19, for example, by providing information about possible performance

at a particular location or under particular circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a franchisor does not provide any financial performance representation in Item 19, also state:</p><p class="depth0">We do not make any representations about a franchisee's future financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with the actual records of that outlet. If you receive any other financial performance information or projections of your future income, you should report it to the franchisor's management by contacting [name, address, and telephone number], the Federal Trade Commission, and the appropriate state regulatory agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the franchisor makes any financial performance representation to prospective franchisees, the franchisor must have a reasonable basis and written substantiation for the representation at the time the representation is made and must state the representation in the Item 19 disclosure. The franchisor must also disclose the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the representation is an historic financial performance representation about the franchise system's existing outlets, or a subset of those outlets, or is a forecast of the prospective franchisee's future financial performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the representation relates to past performance of the franchise system's existing outlets, the material bases for the representation, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the representation relates to the performance of all of the franchise system's existing outlets or only to a subset of outlets that share a particular set of characteristics (for example, geographic location, type of location (such as free standing vs. shopping center), degree of competition, length of time the outlets have operated, services or goods sold, services supplied by the franchisor, and whether the outlets are franchised or franchisor-owned or operated).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The dates when the reported level of financial performance was achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The total number of outlets that existed in the relevant period and, if different, the number of outlets that had the described characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The number of outlets with the described characteristics whose actual financial performance data were used in arriving at the representation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Of those outlets whose data were used in arriving at the representation, the number and percent that actually attained or surpassed the stated results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Characteristics of the included outlets, such as those characteristics noted in paragraph (3)(ii)(A) of this section, that may differ materially from those of the outlet that may be offered to a prospective franchisee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the representation is a forecast of future financial performance, state the material bases and assumptions on which the projection is based. The material assumptions underlying a forecast include significant factors upon which a franchisee's future results are expected to depend. These factors include, for example, economic or market conditions that are basic to a franchisee's operation, and encompass matters affecting, among other things, a franchisee's sales, the cost of goods or services sold, and operating expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A clear and conspicuous admonition that a new franchisee's individual financial results may differ from the result stated in the financial performance representation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement that written substantiation for the financial performance representation will be made available to the prospective franchisee upon reasonable request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a franchisor wishes to disclose only the actual operating results for a specific outlet being offered for sale, it need not comply with this section, provided the information is given only to potential purchasers of that outlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a franchisor furnishes financial performance information according to this section, the franchisor may deliver to a prospective franchisee a supplemental financial performance representation about a particular location or variation, apart from the disclosure document. The supplemental representation must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explain the departure from the financial performance representation in the disclosure document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Be prepared in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (s)(3)(i)-(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Be furnished to the prospective franchisee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Item 20: Outlets and Franchisee Information.
