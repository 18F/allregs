                            <p class="depth0">Current and accrued liabilities are those obligations which have either matured or which become due within one year from the date of issuance or assumption, except for: bonds, receivers' certificates and similar obligations which must be classified as long-term debt until date of maturity; accrued taxes, such as income taxes, which must be classified as accrued liabilities even though payable more than one year from date; compensation awards, which must be classified as current liabilities regardless of date due; and minor amounts payable in installments which may be classified as current liabilities. If a liability is due more than one year from date of issuance or assumption by the service company, it shall be credited to a long-term debt account appropriate for the transaction, except, however, the current liabilities previously mentioned.</p>
