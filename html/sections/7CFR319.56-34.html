                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Clementines (Citrus reticulata) from Spain may only be imported into  the United States in accordance with this section and all other  applicable provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Trust fund agreement. Clementines from Spain may be imported  only if the Government of Spain or its designated representative enters  into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before each shipping season in  accordance with Sec. 319.56-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grower registration and agreement. Persons who produce  clementines in Spain for export to the United States must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be registered with the Government of Spain; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enter into an agreement with the Government of Spain whereby the  producer agrees to participate in and follow the Mediterranean fruit fly  management program established by the Government of Spain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Management program for Mediterranean fruit fly; monitoring. The  Government of Spain's Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata)  management program must be approved by APHIS, and must contain the fruit  fly trapping and recordkeeping requirements specified in this paragraph.  The program must also provide that clementine producers must allow APHIS  inspectors access to clementine production areas in order to monitor  compliance with the Mediterranean fruit fly management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trapping and control. In areas where clementines are produced  for export to the United States, traps must be placed in Mediterranean  fruit fly host plants at least 6 weeks prior to harvest. Bait treatments  using malathion, spinosad, or another pesticide that is approved by  APHIS and the Government of Spain must be applied in the production  areas at the rate specified by Spain's Medfly management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records. The Government of Spain or its designated  representative must keep records that document the fruit fly trapping  and control activities in areas that produce clementines for export to  the United States. All trapping and control records kept by the  Government of Spain or its designated representative must be made  available to APHIS upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance. If APHIS determines that an orchard is not operating  in compliance with the regulations in this section, it may suspend  exports of clementines from that orchard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. Clementines from Spain must be  accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate stating that the fruit meets  the conditions of the Government of Spain's Mediterranean fruit fly  management program and applicable APHIS regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Labeling. Boxes in which clementines are packed must be labeled  with a lot number that provides information to identify the orchard  where the fruit was grown and the packinghouse where the fruit was  packed. The lot number must end with the letters ``US.'' All labeling  must be large enough to clearly display the required information and  must be located on the outside of the boxes to facilitate inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pre-treatment sampling. For each consignment of clementines  intended for export to the United States, prior to cold treatment,  inspectors will cut and inspect a sample of clementines determined by  APHIS that are randomly selected from throughout the consignment. If  inspectors find a single live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of   development during an inspection, the entire consignment of clementines  will be rejected. If a live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of  development is found in any two lots of fruit from the same orchard  during the same shipping season, that orchard will be removed from the  export program for the remainder of that shipping season.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cold treatment. Clementines must be cold treated in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter. Upon arrival of clementines at a port of  entry into the United States, inspectors will examine the cold treatment  data for each consignment to ensure that the cold treatment was  successfully completed. If the cold treatment has not been successfully  completed, the consignment will be held until appropriate remedial  actions have been implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Port of entry sampling. Clementines imported from Spain are  subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of entry into the  United States. At the port of first arrival, an inspector will sample  and cut clementines from each consignment to detect pest infestation  according to sampling rates determined by the Administrator. If a single  live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of development is found, the  consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and  appropriate remedial actions have been implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Suspension of program. If APHIS determines at any time that the  safeguards contained in this section are not protecting against the  introduction of Medflies into the United States, APHIS may suspend the  importation of clementines and conduct an investigation into the cause  of the deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Definitions. The following are definitions for terms used in  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Untreated fruit. For untreated fruit, the term  means one or more lots (containing no more than a combined total of  200,000 boxes of clementines) that are presented to an inspector for  pre-treatment inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treated fruit. For treated fruit, the term means one or more  lots of clementines that are imported into the United States on the same  conveyance.</p><p class="depth3">Lot. For the purposes of this section, a number of units of  clementines that are from a common origin (i.e., a single producer or a  homogenous production unit.) \9\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\9\ A homogeneous production unit is a group of adjacent orchards in  Spain that are owned by one or more growers who follow a homogenous  production system under the same technical guidance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Orchard.
