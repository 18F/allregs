In addition,  access to certain Confidential COMSEC information is permitted as  authorized by a National Communications Security Committee waiver dated  February 14, 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each employee of the Commission is processed for one of the two  levels of access authorization. Licensees and other persons will furnish  National Security Information and/or Restricted Data to a Commission  employee on official business when the employee has the appropriate  level of NRC access authorization and need-to-know. Some individuals are  permitted to begin NRC employment without an access authorization.  However, no NRC employee shall be permitted access to any classified  information until the appropriate level of access authorization has been  granted to that employee by NRC.
