                                Sec. 51.30  Recognition and certification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Under Secretary for Health will make the determination  regarding recognition and the initial determination regarding  certification, after receipt of a recommendation from the director of  the VA medical center of jurisdiction regarding whether, based on a VA  survey, the facility and facility management meet or do not meet the  standards of subpart D of this part. The recognition survey will be  conducted only after the new facility either has at least 21 residents  or has a number of residents that consist of at least 50 percent of the  new bed capacity of the new facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each facility recognized as a State home, the director of  the VA medical center of jurisdiction will certify annually whether the  facility and facility management meet, provisionally meet, or do not  meet the standards of subpart D of this part (this certification should  be made every 12 months during the recognition anniversary month or  during a month agreed upon by the VA medical care center director and  officials of the State home facility). A provisional certification will  be issued by the director only upon a determination that the facility or  facility management does not meet one or more of the standards in  subpart D, that the deficiencies do not jeopardize the health or safety  of the residents, and that the facility management and the director have  agreed to a plan of correction to remedy the deficiencies in a specified  amount of time (not more time than the VA medical center of jurisdiction  director determines is reasonable for correcting the specific  deficiencies). The director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction  will notify the official in charge of the facility, the State official  authorized to oversee the operations of the State home, the VA Network  Director (10N 1-22), Chief Network Officer (10N) and the Chief  Consultant, Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care (114) of the  certification, provisional certification, or noncertification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once a facility has achieved recognition, the recognition will  remain in effect unless the State requests that the recognition be  withdrawn or the Under Secretary for Health makes a final decision that  the facility or facility management does not meet the standards of  subpart D. Recognition of a facility will apply only to the facility as  it exists at the time of recognition; any annex, branch, enlargement,  expansion, or relocation must be separately recognized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Both during the application process for recognition and after  the Under Secretary for Health has recognized a facility, VA may survey  the facility as necessary to determine if the facility and facility  management comply with the provisions of this part. Generally, VA will  provide advance notice to the State before a survey occurs; however,  surveys may be conducted without notice. A survey, as necessary, will  cover all parts of the facility, and include a review and audit of all  records of the facility that have a bearing on compliance with any of  the requirements of this part (including any reports from State or local  entities). For purposes of a survey, at the request of the director of  the VA medical center of jurisdiction, the State home facility  management must submit to the director a completed VA Form 10-3567,  Staffing Profile, which is available at any VA medical center and at  http://www.va.gov/vaforms. The director of the VA medical center of  jurisdiction will designate the VA officials to survey the facility.  These officials may include physicians; nurses; pharmacists;   dietitians; rehabilitation therapists; social workers; representatives  from health administration, engineering, environmental management  systems, and fiscal officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, during the process for recognition and certification, the  director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction recommends that the  State home facility or facility management does not meet the standards  of this part or if, after recognition and certification have been  granted, the director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction  determines that the State home facility or facility management does not  meet the standards of this part, the director will notify the State home  facility in writing of the standards not met. The director will send a  copy of this notice to the State official authorized to oversee  operations of the facility, the VA Network Director (10N 1-22), the  Chief Network Officer (10N), and the Chief Consultant, Geriatrics and  Extended Care (114). The letter will include the reasons for the  recommendation or decision and indicate that the State has the right to  appeal the recommendation or decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State must submit the appeal to the Under Secretary for  Health in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice of the  recommendation or decision regarding the failure to meet the standards.  In its appeal, the State must explain why the recommendation or  determination is inaccurate or incomplete and provide any new and  relevant information not previously considered. Any appeal that does not  identify a reason for disagreement will be returned to the sender  without further consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After reviewing the matter, including any relevant supporting  documentation, the Under Secretary for Health will issue a written  determination that affirms or reverses the previous recommendation or  determination. If the Under Secretary for Health decides that the  facility does not meet the standards of subpart D of this part, the  Under Secretary for Health will withdraw recognition and stop paying per  diem for care provided on and after the date of the decision (or not  grant recognition and certification and not pay per diem if the appeal  occurs during the recognition process). The decision of the Under  Secretary for Health will constitute a final decision that may be  appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (see 38 U.S.C. 7104 and 7105  and 38 CFR part 20). The Under Secretary for Health will send a copy of  this decision to the State home facility and to the State official  authorized to oversee the operations of the State home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In the event that a VA survey team or other VA medical center  staff identifies any condition that poses an immediate threat to public  or patient safety or other information indicating the existence of such  a threat, the director of VA medical center of jurisdiction will  immediately report this to the VA Network Director (10N 1-22), Chief  Network Officer (10N), Chief Consultant, Office of Geriatrics and  Extended Care (114) and State official authorized to oversee operations  of the State home.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101, 501, 1710, 1741-1743)  (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection requirements in this section under control number 2900-0160)  [65 FR 968, Jan. 6, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 19432, Apr. 29, 2009; 78  FR 51675, Aug. 21, 2013]</p>
