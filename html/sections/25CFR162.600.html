                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part  162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920  (41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust  lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without  the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44  Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80).  However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may  authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such  lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a matter  of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general regulations  contained in this part 162 shall be   applicable. Approval of the Secretary is required on leases signed by  Crow Indians not classified as competent or made on inherited or devised  trust lands owned by more than five competent devisees or heirs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of  March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or  grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years,  except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for  periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a  preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby  extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years  authorized by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent,  under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow  Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under  these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to  lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year  in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to  afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is  the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at  intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are  able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing  leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these  circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the  protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed.  Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease  which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or  requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and  any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the  commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel  an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take  effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal  program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow  Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which  require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved.  Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such  an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the  Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease  entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such  instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such  instrument will be returned without recordation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases  will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon  discovery of the condition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by  all owners of the land described in the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of  the same term;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land  utilization plans and conservation practices; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to,  erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly  endorsed by the lessor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the  full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease  made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by  the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust  lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the  right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine  oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements,  in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or  granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due  consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the  adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute  as to the amount of such damage, the matter will be referred to the  Secretary whose determination will be final as to the amount of said  damage.
