                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When certified cost or pricing data are required, offerors are  required to describe any forward pricing rate agreements (FPRAs) in each  specific pricing proposal to which the rates apply and to identify the  latest cost or pricing data already submitted in accordance with the  FPRA. All data submitted in connection with the FPRA, updated as  necessary, form a part of the total data that the offeror certifies to  be accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price for  an initial contract or for a contract modification. (See the Certificate  of Current Cost or Pricing Data at 15.406-2.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting officers will use FPRA rates as bases for pricing  all contracts, modifications, and other contractual actions to be  performed during the period covered by the agreement. Conditions that  may affect the agreement's validity shall be reported promptly to the  ACO. If the ACO determines that a changed condition invalidates the  agreement, the ACO shall notify all interested parties of the extent of  its effect and status of efforts to establish a revised FPRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting officers shall not require certification at the time  of agreement for data supplied in support of FPRA's or other advance  agreements. When a forward pricing rate agreement or other advance  agreement is used to price a contract action that requires a  certificate, the certificate supporting that contract action shall cover  the data supplied to support the FPRA or other advance agreement, and  all other data supporting the action.
