                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 836.574, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Subcontracts and Work Coordination (APR 1984)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nothing contained in this contract shall be construed as  creating any contractual relationship between any subcontractor and the  Government. Divisions or sections of specifications are not intended to  control the contractor in dividing work among subcontractors, or to  limit work performed by any trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts  and omissions of his/her own employees, and of the subcontractors and  their employees. The contractor shall also be responsible for  coordination of the work of the trades, subcontractors, and material  suppliers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Government or its representatives will not undertake to  settle any differences between the contractor and subcontractors or  between subcontractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Government reserves the right to refuse to permit employment  on the work or require dismissal from the work of any subcontractor who,  by reason of previous unsatisfactory work on Department of Veterans  Affairs projects or for any other reason, is considered by the  contracting officer to be incompetent or otherwise objectionable.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (JUL 2002). For new construction work with complex  mechanical-electrical work, the following paragraph relating to work  coordination may be substituted for paragraph (b) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts  and omissions of his/her own employees, and subcontractors and their  employees. The contractor shall also be responsible for coordination of  the work of the trades, subcontractors, and material suppliers. The  contractor shall, in advance of the work, prepare coordination drawings  showing the location of openings through slabs, the pipe sleeves and  hanger inserts, as well as the location and elevation of utility lines,  including, but not limited to, conveyor systems, pneumatic tubes, ducts,  and conduits and pipes 2 inches and larger in diameter. These drawings,  including plans,   elevations, and sections as appropriate, shall clearly show the manner  in which the utilities fit into the available space and relate to each  other and to existing building elements. Drawings shall be of  appropriate scale to satisfy the previously stated purposes, but not  smaller than \3/8\-inch scale. Drawings may be composite (with  distinctive colors for the various trades) or may be separate but fully  coordinated drawings (such as sepias or photographic paper  reproducibles) of the same scale. Separate drawings shall depict  identical building areas or sections and shall be capable of being  overlaid in any combination. The submitted drawings for a given area of  the project shall show the work of all trades that will be involved in  that particular area. Six complete composite drawings or six complete  sets of separate reproducible drawings shall be received by the  Government not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled start of the  work in the area illustrated by the drawings, for the purpose of showing  the contractor's planned methods of installation. The objectives of such  drawings are to promote carefully planned work sequence and proper trade  coordination, in order to assure the expeditious solutions of problems  and the installation of lines and equipment as contemplated by the  contract documents while avoiding or minimizing additional costs to the  contractor and to the Government. In the event the contractor, in  coordinating the various installations and in planning the method of  installation, finds a conflict in location or elevation of any of the  utilities with themselves, with structural items or with other  construction items, he/she shall bring this conflict to the attention of  the contracting officer immediately. In doing so, the contractor shall  explain the proposed method of solving the problem or shall request  instructions as to how to proceed if adjustments beyond those of usual  trades coordination are necessary. Utilities installation work will not  proceed in any area prior to the submission and completion of the  Government review of the coordinated drawings for that area, nor in any  area in which conflicts are disclosed by the coordination drawings,  until the conflicts have been corrected to the satisfaction of the  contracting officer. It is the responsibility of the contractor to  submit the required drawings in a timely manner consistent with the  requirements to complete the work covered by this contract within the  prescribed contract time.    852.236-81  [Reserved]</p>
