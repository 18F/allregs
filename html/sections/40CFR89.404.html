                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating  conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases,  generated raw or dilute during engine operation, are sampled for  specific component analysis through the analytical train. The test is  applicable to engines equipped with catalytic or direct-flame  afterburners, induction system modifications, or other systems, or to  uncontrolled engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions  of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate  matter. For more information on particulate matter sampling see  Sec. 89.112(c). The test cycles consist of various steady-state  operating modes that include different combinations of engine speeds and  loads. These procedures require the determination of the concentration  of each pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow (raw analysis), and the  power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used  to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per kilowatt hour (g/ kW-hr).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions, the complete  engine shall be tested with all emission control devices installed and  functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, or  air compressors) may be installed but such accessory loading will be  considered parasitic in nature and observed power shall be used in the  emission calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the  application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart.  In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance to correct  component failure or malfunction must be authorized in accordance with  Sec. 86.094-25 of this chapter.
