                                Sec. 50.5  Waivers for the delivery of health care service.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In determining whether to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor  to deliver health care service, the Board will consider information from  and coordinate with State Departments of Public Health (or the  equivalent), other ``interested government agencies'' which request  waivers, and other relevant agencies. The Board requires the following  criteria for requests for waivers for the delivery of health care  service:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Exchange Visitor must submit a statement that he or she does  not have pending and will not submit any other ``interested government  agency'' waiver request while HHS processes the waiver request being  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waivers are limited to primary care physicians and general  psychiatrists who have completed their primary care or psychiatric  residency training programs no more than12 months before the date of  commencement of employment under the contract described in subparagraph  (d). This 12-month eligibility limitation is to ensure that the  physicians' primary care training is current and they are not engaged in  subspecialty training. This HHS eligibility requirement relates only to  eligibility for an HHS waiver request and does not relieve physicians of  the responsibility to maintain lawful status. Alien physicians are  strongly encouraged to begin the waiver process as early as they  possibly can while still in the residency training program. Early filing  of the waiver request by the alien physician, coupled with timely  processing of the request by the relevant government agencies, will  facilitate the timely completion of the waiver process before the  authorized J-1 admission expires, and the physician's subsequent  application for change of nonimmigrant status from J-1 to H-1B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Primary care physicians are defined as: physicians practicing  general internal medicine, pediatrics, family   practice or obstetrics/gynecology willing to work in a primary care  Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) or Medically Underserved Area  or Population (MUA/P); and general psychiatrists who are willing to work  in a Mental Health HPSA. Note: these HHS eligibility criteria for  waivers are in addition to and independent of the existing waiver and  visa criteria established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS), the Department of State, and the Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Exchange Visitor must have entered a contract with the  applicant employer. This contract must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require the Exchange Visitor to provide primary medical care in  a facility physically located in an HHS-designated primary care HPSA or  MUA/P, or general psychiatric care in a Mental Health HPSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the Exchange Visitor to complete a term of employment of  not less than three years providing primary care health services for not  less than 40 hours per week.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require the Exchange Visitor to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be licensed by the State where he or she will practice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have completed a residency in one of the following specialties:  family practice, general pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, general  internal medicine, or general psychiatry; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be either board certified or board eligible in the relevant  primary care discipline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be terminable only for cause until completion of the three-year  commitment, except that, with the agreement of the alien physician, the  employer may assign the contract to another eligible employer with the  prior approval of HHS and compliance with all applicable INS and  Department of Labor requirements. Prior to approving an assignment of  the contract, HHS will review and consider the health care needs of the  alien physician's current and proposed new locations, as well as the  reasons for the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not contain a restrictive covenant or non-compete clause which  prevents or discourages the physician from continuing to practice in any  HHS-designated primary care HPSA or MUA/P or Mental Health HPSA after  the period of obligation under the contract has expired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide that any amendment to the contract complies with all  applicable Federal statutes, regulations and HHS policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Be consistent with all applicable Federal statutes, regulations  and HHS policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The facility or practice sponsoring the physician:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must provide health services to individuals without  discriminating against them because either they are unable to pay for  those services or payment for those health services will be made under  Medicare or Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May charge no more than the usual and customary rate prevailing  in the geographic area in which the services are provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must provide care on a sliding fee scale for persons at or below  200 percent of poverty income level. Persons with third-party insurance  may be charged the full fee for service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Must post a notice in a conspicuous location in the patient  waiting area at the practice site to notify patients of the charges for  service as required in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Must provide evidence that the applicant facility made  unsuccessful efforts to recruit a physician who is a United States  physician for the position to be filled by the Exchange Visitor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Must provide a statement by the head of the facility to confirm  the facility is located in a specific, designated HPSA or MUA/P, and  that it provides medical care to Medicaid and Medicare eligible patients  and to the uninsured indigent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The employer and the alien physician must submit information to  the Secretary at the times and in the manner that the Secretary may  reasonably require.
