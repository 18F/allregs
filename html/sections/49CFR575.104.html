For purposes of this paragraph, new tire line shall mean a group of tires differing substantially in construction, materials, or design from those previously sold by the manufacturer or brand name owner of the tires. As used in this paragraph, the term ``construction'' refers to the internal structure of the tire (e.g., cord angles, number and placement of breakers), ``materials'' refers to the substances used in manufacture of the tire (e.g., belt fiber, rubber compound), and ``design'' refers to properties or conditions imposed by the tire mold (e.g., aspect ratio, tread pattern).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each tire manufactured on and after the effective date of these amendments, other than a tire sold as original equipment on a new vehicle, shall have affixed to its tread surface so as not to be easily removable a label or labels containing its grades and other information in the form illustrated in Figure 2, Parts I and II. The treadwear grade attributed to the tire shall be either imprinted or indelibly stamped on the label containing the material in Part I of Figure 2, directly to the right of or below the word ``TREADWEAR.''

The traction grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in an array of the potential grade letters AA, A, B, or C, directly to the right of or below the word ``TRACTION'' in Part I of Figure 2. The temperature resistance grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in an array of the potential grade letters A, B, or C, directly to the right of or below the word ``TEMPERATURE'' in Part I of Figure 2. The words ``TREADWEAR,'' ``TRACTION,'' AND ``TEMPERATURE,'' in that order, may be laid out vertically or horizontally. The text of Part II of Figure 2 may be printed in capital letters. The text of Part I and the text of Part II of Figure 2 need not appear on the same label, but the edges of the two texts must be positioned on the tire tread so as to be separated by a distance of no more than one inch. If the text of Part I and the text of Part II of Figure 2 are placed on separate labels, the notation ``See EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES'' shall be added to the bottom of the Part I text, and the words ``EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES'' shall appear at the top of the Part II text. The text of Figure 2 shall be oriented on the tire tread surface with lines of type running perpendicular to the tread circumference. If a label bearing a tire size designation is attached to the tire tread surface and the tire size designation is oriented with lines type running perpendicular to the tread circumference, the text of Figure 2 shall read in the same direction as the tire size designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of the information required by Sec. 575.6(c) to be furnished to prospective purchasers of tires, each tire manufacturer or brand name owner shall, as part of that information, list all possible grades for traction and temperature resistance, and restate verbatim the explanation for each performance area specified in Figure 2.

At the end of the first circuit, rotate each vehicle's tires by moving each front tire to the same side of the rear axle and each rear tire to the opposite side of the front axle. Visually inspect each tire for any indication of abnormal wear, tread separation, bulging of the sidewall, or any sign of tire failure.

Measure, to the nearest 0.001 inch, the tread depth of each candidate and each course monitoring tire, avoiding treadwear indicators, at six equally spaced points in each groove. For each tire compute the average of the measurements. Do not measure those shoulder grooves which are not provided with treadwear indicators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the manufacturer's specifications, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment according to the manufacturer's recommended setting.

TEMPERATURE A B C</p><p class="depth0">(Part II) All Passenger Car Tires Must Conform to Federal Safety Requirements in Addition to These Grades</p><p class="depth0">Treadwear</p><p class="depth0">The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half (1\1/2\) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.</p><p class="depth0">Traction</p><p class="depth0">The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">Temperature</p><p class="depth0">The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law. Warning: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A--Treadwear Test Course and Driving Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Introduction.
