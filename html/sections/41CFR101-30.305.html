After reviewing the request for an exemption, GSA will inform the requesting agency of the decision and will provide instructions for implementation. The request for an exemption shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Number of items repetitively procured, stored, distributed, or issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number of items currently used having national stock numbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification system planned or in use other than the Federal catalog system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether procurement is centralized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Description of any catalogs published.
