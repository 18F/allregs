                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disposal site suitability for near-surface disposal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  purpose of this section is to specify the minimum characteristics a  disposal site must have to be acceptable for use as a near-surface  disposal facility. The primary emphasis in disposal site suitability is  given to isolation of wastes, a matter having long-term impacts, and to  disposal site features that ensure that the long-term performance  objectives of subpart C of this part are met, as opposed to short-term  convenience or benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The disposal site shall be capable of being characterized,  modeled, analyzed and monitored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within the region or state where the facility is to be located,  a disposal site should be selected so that projected population growth  and future developments are not likely to affect the ability of the  disposal facility to meet the performance objectives of subpart C of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Areas must be avoided having known natural resources which, if  exploited, would result in failure to meet the performance objectives of  subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The disposal site must be generally well drained and free of  areas of flooding or frequent ponding. Waste disposal shall not take  place in a 100-year flood plain, coastal high-hazard area or wetland, as  defined in Executive Order 11988, ``Floodplain Management Guidelines.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Upstream drainage areas must be minimized to decrease the amount  of runoff which could erode or inundate waste disposal units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The disposal site must provide sufficient depth to the water  table that ground water intrusion, perennial or otherwise, into the  waste will not occur. The Commission will consider an exception to this  requirement to allow disposal below the water table if it can be  conclusively shown that disposal site characteristics will result in  molecular diffusion being the predominant means of radionuclide movement   and the rate of movement will result in the performance objectives of  subpart C of this part being met. In no case will waste disposal be  permitted in the zone of fluctuation of the water table.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The hydrogeologic unit used for disposal shall not discharge  ground water to the surface within the disposal site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Areas must be avoided where tectonic processes such as faulting,  folding, seismic activity, or vulcanism may occur with such frequency  and extent to significantly affect the ability of the disposal site to  meet the performance objectives of subpart C of this part, or may  preclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term impacts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Areas must be avoided where surface geologic processes such as  mass wasting, erosion, slumping, landsliding, or weathering occur with  such frequency and extent to significantly affect the ability of the  disposal site to meet the performance objectives of subpart C of this  part, or may preclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term  impacts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The disposal site must not be located where nearby facilities  or activities could adversely impact the ability of the site to meet the  performance objectives of subpart C of this part or significantly mask  the environmental monitoring program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposal site suitability requirements for land disposal other  than near-surface.
