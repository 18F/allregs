                            <p class="depth0">The MLS is a precision approach and landing guidance system which provides position information and various ground-to-air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation angle measurement and a range (distance) measurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An MLS constructed to meet the requirements of this subpart must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approach azimuth equipment, associated monitor, remote control and indicator equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approach elevation equipment, associated monitor, remote control and indicator equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A means for the encoding and transmission of essential data words, associated monitor, remote control and indicator equipment. Essential data are basic data words 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and auxiliary data words A1, A2 and A3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Distance measuring equipment (DME), associated monitor, remote control and indicator equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Remote controls for paragraphs (a) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section must include as a minimum on/off and reset capabilities and may be integrated in the same equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> At locations where a VHF marker beacon (75 MHz) is already installed, it may be used in lieu of the DME equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the equipment required in paragraph (a) of this section the MLS may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Back azimuth equipment, associated monitor, remote control and indicator equipment.
