transient dynamic loads and vibrations, as determined by dynamic analysis, resulting from failure of a blade, shaft, bearing or bearing support, or bird strike event. Any permanent deformation from these ultimate load conditions must not prevent continued safe flight and landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ultimate loads developed from the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section are to be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiplied by a factor of 1.0 when applied to engine mounts and pylons; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiplied by a factor of 1.25 when applied to adjacent supporting airframe structure.
