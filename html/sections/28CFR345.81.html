                            <p class="depth0">FPI encourages the development and use of pre-industrial training programs. Such training ordinarily provides benefits to the inmate and to the FPI factory. Pre-industrial training also provides an additional management tool for replacing inmate idleness with constructive activity. Accordingly, each FPI factory location may provide a pre-industrial training program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-industrial program trainees shall ordinarily begin at the entry level pay grade (grade 5). Positions for pre-industrial training programs are filled in the same manner as other grade five positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pre-industrial training is not a prerequisite for work placement if the inmate already possesses the needed skill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If pre-industrial training is available and the worker has not completed both the skill training and orientation phases of pre-industrial training, the

inmate should be put into the first available training class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When pre-industrial training is not available, new FPI assignees will receive on-the-job training in pre-industrial pay status for a period of at least 30 days before being promoted into available fourth grade jobs.</p>
