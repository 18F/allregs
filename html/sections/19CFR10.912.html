After receipt of a post-importation claim under Sec. 10.911 of this subpart, the port director will determine whether the entry covering the good has been liquidated and, if liquidation has taken place, whether the liquidation has become final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pending protest or judicial review. If the port director determines that any protest relating to the good has not been finally decided, the port director will suspend action on the claim filed under Sec. 10.911 of this subpart until the decision on the protest becomes final. If a summons involving the tariff classification or dutiability of the good is filed in the Court of International Trade, the port director will suspend action on the claim filed under Sec. 10.911 of this subpart until judicial review has been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowance of claim--(1) Unliquidated entry.

The port director may deny a claim for a refund filed under Sec. 10.911 of this subpart if the claim was not filed timely, if the importer has not complied with the requirements of Sec. 10.908 and 10.911 of this subpart, or if, following an origin verification under Sec. 10.926 of this subpart, the port director determines either that the imported good was not an originating good at the time of importation or that a basis exists upon which preferential tariff treatment may be denied under Sec. 10.926 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.
