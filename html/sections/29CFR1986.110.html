                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Assistant Secretary or any other party desiring to seek  review, including judicial review, of a decision of the ALJ must file a  written petition for review with the ARB, which has been delegated the  authority to act for the Secretary and issue final decisions under this  part. The parties should identify in their petitions for review the  legal conclusions or orders to which they object, or the objections may  be deemed waived. A petition must be filed within 14 days of the date of  the decision of the ALJ. The date of the postmark, facsimile  transmittal, or electronic communication transmittal will be considered  to be the date of filing; if the petition is filed in person, by hand- delivery or other means, the petition is considered filed upon receipt.  The petition must be served on all parties and on the Chief  Administrative Law Judge at the time it is filed with   the ARB. Copies of the petition for review and all briefs must be served  on the Assistant Secretary and, in cases in which the Assistant  Secretary is a party, on the Associate Solicitor, Division of  Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a timely petition for review is filed pursuant to paragraph  (a) of this section, the decision of the ALJ will become the final order  of the Secretary unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the  petition, issues an order notifying the parties that the case has been  accepted for review. If a case is accepted for review, the decision of  the ALJ will be inoperative unless and until the ARB issues an order  adopting the decision, except that any order of reinstatement will be  effective while review is conducted by the ARB unless the ARB grants a  motion by the respondent to stay that order based on exceptional  circumstances. The ARB will specify the terms under which any briefs are  to be filed. The ARB will review the factual determinations of the ALJ  under the substantial evidence standard. If no timely petition for  review is filed, or the ARB denies review, the decision of the ALJ will  become the final order of the Secretary. If no timely petition for  review is filed, the resulting final order is not subject to judicial  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final decision of the ARB will be issued within 120 days of  the conclusion of the hearing, which will be deemed to be 14 days after  the date of the decision of the ALJ, unless a motion for reconsideration  has been filed with the ALJ in the interim. In such case, the conclusion  of the hearing is the date the motion for reconsideration is ruled upon  or 14 days after a new decision is issued. The ARB's final decision will  be served upon all parties and the Chief Administrative Law Judge by  mail. The final decision also will be served on the Assistant Secretary  and on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Occupational Safety and  Health, U.S. Department of Labor, even if the Assistant Secretary is not  a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the ARB concludes that the respondent has violated the law,  the ARB will issue a final order providing relief to the complainant.  The final order will require, where appropriate: affirmative action to  abate the violation; reinstatement of the complainant to his or her  former position, with the same compensation, terms, conditions, and  privileges of the complainant's employment; payment of compensatory  damages (backpay with interest and compensation for any special damages  sustained as a result of the retaliation, including any litigation  costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees the complainant  may have incurred); and payment of punitive damages up to $250,000.  Interest on backpay will be calculated using the interest rate  applicable to underpayment of taxes under 26 U.S.C. 6621 and will be  compounded daily.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the ARB determines that the respondent has not violated the  law, an order will be issued denying the complaint.</p>
