                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to expand upon the  directives set out in Sec. 9.6 of this part, and to set out the  mitigative actions required if the preliminary determination is made to  carry out an action that affects or is in a floodplain or wetland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General provisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency shall design or modify its  actions so as to minimize harm to or within the floodplain;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency shall minimize the destruction, loss or degradation  of wetlands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency shall restore and preserve natural and beneficial  floodplain values; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Agency shall preserve and enhance natural and beneficial  wetland values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimization provisions. The Agency shall minimize:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Potential harm to lives and the investment at risk from the base  flood, or, in the case of critical actions, from the 500-year flood;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Potential adverse impacts the action may have on others; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Potential adverse impact the action may have on floodplain and  wetland values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>,  and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion). Any Agency  action to which the following specific requirements do not apply, shall  nevertheless be subject to the full 8-step   process (Sec. 9.6) including the general requirement to minimize harm  to and within floodplains:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement in  a floodway, and no new construction in a coastal high hazard area,  except for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A functionally dependent use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A structure or facility which facilitates an open space use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a structure which is a functionally dependent use, or which  facilitates an open space use, the following applies. There shall be no  construction of a new or substantially improved structure in a coastal  high hazard area unless it is elevated on adequately anchored pilings or  columns, and securely anchored to such piles or columns so that the  lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding  the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level  (the 500-year flood level for critical actions) (including wave height).  The structure shall be anchored so as to withstand velocity waters and  hurricane wave wash. The Regional Administrator shall be responsible for  determining the base flood level, including the wave height, in all  cases. Where there is a FIRM in effect, it shall be the basis of the  Regional Administrator's determination. If the FIRM does not reflect  wave heights, or if there is no FIRM in effect, the Regional  Administrator is responsible for delineating the base flood level,  including wave heights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elevation of structures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There shall be no new construction  or substantial improvement of structures unless the lowest floor of the  structures (including basement) is at or above the level of the base  flood.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement  of structures involving a critical action unless the lowest floor of the  structure (including the basement) is at or above the level of the 500- year flood.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the subject structure is nonresidential, FEMA may, instead  of elevating the structure to the 100-year or 500-year level, as  appropriate, approve the design of the structure and its attendant  utility and sanitary facilities so that below the flood level the  structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the  passage of water and with structural components having the capability of  resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this  section do not apply to the extent that the Federal Insurance  Administration has granted an exception under 44 CFR Sec. 60.6(b)  (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(b)), or the community has granted a variance  which the Regional Administrator determines is consistent with 44 CFR  60.6(a) (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(a)). In a community which does not have  a FIRM in effect, FEMA may approve a variance from the standards of  paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, after compliance  with the standards of 44 CFR 60.6(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There shall be no encroachments, including fill, new  construction, substantial improvements of structures or facilities, or  other development within a designated regulatory floodway that would  result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the  occurrence of the base flood discharge. Until a regulatory floodway is  designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other  development (including fill) shall be permitted within the base  floodplain unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the  proposed development, when combined with all other existing and  anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation  of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Even if an action is a functionally dependent use or facilitates  open space uses (under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section) and  does not increase flood heights (under paragraph (d)(4) of this  section), such action may only be taken in a floodway or coastal high  hazard area if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such site is the only practicable alternative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Harm to and within the floodplain is minimized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In addition to standards (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section,  no action may be taken if it is inconsistent with the criteria of the  National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59 et   seq.) or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain  management standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> New construction and substantial improvement of structures shall  be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather  than on fill, in all cases in coastal high hazard areas and elsewhere,  where practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and  welfare, the Agency shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in  floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and  ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Facilitate adequate access and egress to and from the site of  the proposed action; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in  flash flood, rapid-rise or tsunami areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> In the replacement of building contents, materials and  equipment, the Regional Administrator shall require as appropriate,  disaster proofing of the building and/or elimination of such future  losses by relocation of those building contents, materials and equipment  outside or above the base floodplain or the 500-year floodplain for  critical actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal Insurance Administration shall make identification of  all coastal high hazard areas a priority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning October 1, 1981, the Federal Insurance Administration  of FEMA may only provide flood insurance for new construction or  substantial improvements in a coastal high hazard area if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Wave heights have been designated for the site of the structure  either by the Administrator of FEMA based upon data generated by FEMA or  by another source, satisfactory to the Administrator; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The structure is rated by FEMA-FIA based on a system which  reflects the capacity to withstand the effects of the 100-year frequency  flood including, but not limited to, the following factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Wave heights;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ability of the structure to withstand the force of waves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> FEMA shall accept and take fully into account information  submitted by a property owner indicating that the rate for a particular  structure is too high based on the ability of the structure to withstand  the force of waves. In order to obtain a rate adjustment, a property  owner must submit to FEMA specific information regarding the structure  and its immediate environment. Such information must be certified by a  registered professional architect or engineer who has demonstrable  experience and competence in the fields of foundation, soils, and  structural engineering. Such information should include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Elevation of the structure (bottom of lowest floor beam) in  relation to the Base Flood Elevation including wave height;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Distance of the structure from the shoreline;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Dune protection and other environmental factors;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Description of the building support system; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Other relevant building details.  Adequate completion of the ``V-Zone Risk Factor Rating Form'' is  sufficient for FEMA to determine whether a rate adjustment is  appropriate. The form is available from and applications for rate  adjustments should be submitted to:  National Flood Insurance Program Attention: V-Zone Underwriting Specialist 9901-A George Palmer Highway Lanham, MD 20706   Pending a determination on a rate adjustment, insurance will be issued  at the class rate. If the rate adjustment is granted, a refund of the  appropriate portion of the premium will be made. Unless a property owner  is seeking an adjustment of the rate prescribed by FEMA-FIA, this  information need not be submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FIA shall notify communities with coastal high hazard areas and  federally related lenders in such communities, of the provisions of this  paragraph. Notice to the lenders may be accomplished by the Federal  instrumentalities to which the lenders are related.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In any case in which the Regional Director has been, pursuant to   Sec. 9.11(d)(1), precluded from providing assistance for a new or  substantially improved structure in a floodway, FIA may not provide a  new or renewed policy of flood insurance for that structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Restore and preserve. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any action taken by the Agency  which affects the floodplain or wetland and which has resulted in, or  will result in, harm to the floodplain or wetland, the Agency shall act  to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by  floodplains and wetlands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where floodplain or wetland values have been degraded by the  proposed action, the Agency shall identify, evaluate and implement  measures to restore the values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an action will result in harm to or within the floodplain or  wetland, the Agency shall design or modify the action to preserve as  much of the natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values as is  possible.  [45 FR 59526, Sept. 9, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 51752, Oct. 22, 1981;  48 FR 44543, Sept. 29, 1983; 49 FR 33879, Aug. 27, 1984; 49 FR 35584,  Sept. 10, 1984; 50 FR 40006, Oct. 1, 1985]</p><p class="depth3">Effective Date Note: At 45 FR 79070, Nov. 28, 1980, Sec. 9.11(e)(4)  was temporarily suspended until further notice.</p>
