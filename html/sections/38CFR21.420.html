This includes veterans:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requesting benefits and services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In receipt of benefits and services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notification. (1) Each notification should include the decision or finding, the reasons, including fact and law, for

the decision, the effective date of the decision or finding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The veteran's appeal rights, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adverse action. An adverse action is one, other than an interim action such as a suspension of benefits pending development, which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Denies Chapter 31 benefits, when such benefits have been requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduces or otherwise diminishes benefits being received by the veteran; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Terminates receipt of benefits for reasons other than scheduled interruptions which are a part of the veteran's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior notification of adverse action. VA shall give the veteran a period of at least 30 days to indicate his or her disagreement with an adverse action other than one which arises as a consequence of a change in training time or other such alteration in circumstances. If the veteran disagrees, he or she shall be given the opportunity, before appealing the adverse action as provided in Sec. 21.59 of this part, to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Meet informally with a representative of VA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review the basis for VA decision, including any relevant written documents or material; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submit to VA any material which he or she may have relevant to the decision.
