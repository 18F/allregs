This subpart describes consultation procedures available to EPA to satisfy the obligations of section 7(a)(2) of the Act in addition to those in subpart B of this part for FIFRA actions authorized, funded, or carried out by EPA in which EPA has discretionary Federal involvement or control. EPA retains discretion to initiate early, informal, or formal consultation as described in Sec. Sec. 402.11, 402.13, and 402.14 for any FIFRA action. The procedures in this subpart may be employed for FIFRA actions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interagency exchanges of information under Sec. 402.43 and advance coordination under Sec. 402.44 are available for any FIFRA action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative consultation under Sec. 402.45 is available for a listed species or critical habitat if EPA determines the FIFRA action is not likely to adversely affect the listed species or critical habitat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional formal consultation under Sec. 402.46 is available for any FIFRA action with respect to any listed species or critical habitat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The special procedures in Sec. 402.47 are available for consultations on FIFRA actions that will be unusually complex due to factors such as the geographic area or number of species that may be affected by the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> EPA shall engage in consultation as to all listed species and critical habitat that may be affected by a FIFRA action, and may in its discretion employ more than one of the available consultation procedures for a FIFRA action that may affect more than one listed species or critical habitat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> EPA shall engage in consultation on actions involving requests for emergency exemptions under section 18 of FIFRA that may affect listed species or critical habitat, and may choose to do so under Sec. 402.05 or other provisions of this subpart or subpart B of this part. Any required formal consultation shall be initiated as soon as practicable after the emergency is under control. For the purposes of Sec. 402.05(b) the definition of formal consultation in Sec. 402.02 includes the procedures in Sec. 402.46.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> EPA must prepare a biological assessment for a FIFRA action to the extent required by Sec. 402.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> EPA must comply with Sec. 402.15 for all FIFRA actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> After a consultation under this subpart has been concluded, EPA shall reinitiate consultation as required by Sec. 402.16 as soon as practicable after a circumstance requiring reinitiation occurs, and may employ the procedures in this subpart or subpart B of this part in any reinitiated consultation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exchanges of scientific information. As part of any of the additional consultation procedures provided in this subpart, EPA and the Services shall establish mutually-agreeable procedures for regular and timely exchanges of scientific information to achieve accurate and informed decision-making under this subpart and to ensure that the FIFRA process considers the best scientific and commercial data available on listed species and critical habitat in a manner consistent with the requirements of FIFRA and ESA.</p>
