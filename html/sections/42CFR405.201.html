                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart establishes that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS uses the FDA categorization of a device as a factor in  making Medicare coverage decisions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS may consider for Medicare coverage certain devices with an  FDA-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) that have been  categorized as Category B (Nonexperimental/investigational) device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS identifies criteria for coverage of items and services  furnished in IDE studies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this subpart--</p><p class="depth2">Category A (Experimental) device refers to a device for which  ``absolute risk'' of the device type has not been established (that is,  initial questions of safety and effectiveness have not been resolved)  and the FDA is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective.</p><p class="depth2">Category B (Nonexperimental/investigational) device refers to a  device for which the incremental risk is the primary risk in question  (that is, initial questions of safety and effectiveness of that device  type have been resolved), or it is known that the device type can be  safe and effective because, for example, other manufacturers have  obtained FDA premarket approval or clearance for that device type.</p><p class="depth2">ClinicalTrials.gov refers to the National Institutes of Health's  National Library of Medicine's online registry and results database of  publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants  conducted around the world.</p><p class="depth2">Contractors refers to Medicare Administrative Contractors and other  entities that contract with CMS to review and adjudicate claims for  Medicare payment of items and services.</p><p class="depth2">Investigational device exemption (IDE) refers to an FDA-approved IDE  application that permits a device, which would otherwise be subject to  marketing approval or clearance, to be shipped lawfully for the purpose  of conducting a clinical study in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 360j(g) and  21 CFR part 812.</p><p class="depth2">Routine care items and services refers to items and services that  are otherwise generally available to Medicare beneficiaries (that is, a  benefit category exists, it is not statutorily excluded, and there is no  national noncoverage decision) that are furnished during a clinical  study and that would be otherwise furnished even if the beneficiary were  not enrolled in a clinical study.
