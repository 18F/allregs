                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Basic ordering agreements may be placed with  advertising agencies for assistance in producing and placing  advertisements when a significant number will be placed in several  publications and in national media. Services of advertising agencies  include, but are not limited to, counseling as to selection of the media  for placement of the advertisement, contacting the media in the interest  of the Government, placing orders, selecting and ordering typography,  copywriting, and preparing rough layouts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of commission-paying media. The services of advertising  agencies in placing advertising with media often can be obtained at no  cost to the Government, over and above the space cost, as many media  give advertising agencies a commission or discount on the space cost  that is not given to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of noncommission-paying media. Some media do not grant  advertising agencies a commission or discount, meaning the Government  can obtain the same rate as the advertising agency. If the advertising  agency agrees to place advertisements in noncommission-paying media as a  no-cost service, the basic ordering agreement shall so provide. If the  advertising agency will not agree to place advertisements at no cost,  the agreement shall (1) provide that the Government may place orders  directly with the media, or (2) specify an amount that the Government  will pay if the agency places the orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Art work, supplies, and incidentals. The basic ordering  agreement also may   provide for the furnishing by the advertising agency of art work,  supplies, and incidentals, including brochures and pamphlets, but not  their printing. Incidentals may include telephone calls, telegrams, and  postage incurred by the advertising agency on behalf of the Government.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 5.6_Publicizing Multi-Agency Use Contracts</p><p class="depth2">Source: 68 FR 43862, July 24, 2003, unless otherwise noted.</p>
