                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Borrower files bankruptcy. When the Agency becomes aware that a Farm Loan Programs borrower has filed for protection under Title 11 of the United States Code (bankruptcy), the borrower and the borrower's attorney, if any, will be notified in writing of the borrower's remaining servicing options.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the borrower wishes to apply for servicing options remaining, the borrower, or the borrower's attorney on behalf of the borrower, must sign and return the appropriate response form, or similar written request for servicing, and any forms or information as requested by the Agency, within 60 days from the date the borrower or the borrower's attorney received the notification, or the time remaining from a previous notification that was suspended when the borrower filed bankruptcy, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency will consider a request for servicing options to be an acknowledgment that the Agency will not be interfering with any rights or protections under the Bankruptcy Code and its automatic stay provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency's processing of any request for servicing may include consideration of primary and preservation loan servicing options, notification of the Agency's decision on the request or application for servicing, mediation, and holding of any meetings or appeals requested by the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If court approval is required for the borrower to exercise these servicing rights, it will be the borrower or the borrower's attorney's responsibility to obtain that approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a plan is confirmed before servicing and any appeal is completed under 7 CFR part 11, the Agency will complete the servicing or appeals process and may consent to a post-confirmation modification of the plan if it is consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In chapter 7 cases, the Agency will not provide primary loan servicing to a borrower discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower reaffirms the entire Agency debt. If the chapter 7 debtor obtains the permission of the court and reaffirms the debt, the loan servicing application will be processed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S. If the borrower reaffirms the Agency debt in order to be considered for restructuring but is later denied restructuring, the borrower may revoke the reaffirmation subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. No reaffirmation is necessary for any discharged chapter 7 borrower to be eligible for preservation loan servicing in accordance with 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Borrower defaults on plan or bankruptcy is dismissed--(1) 90 days past due on a reorganization plan while still under court jurisdiction. (i) If allowed by the Bankruptcy Code or court, the borrower and the borrower's attorney, if any, will be notified of any remaining servicing options under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, that were not exhausted prior to filing bankruptcy or during the bankruptcy proceedings according to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 90 days past due on a reorganization plan while still under court jurisdiction. (i) If allowed by the Bankruptcy Code or court, the borrower and the borrower's attorney, if any, will be notified of any remaining servicing options under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, that were not exhausted prior to filing bankruptcy or during the bankruptcy proceedings according to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If allowed by the Bankruptcy Code or court, the borrower and the borrower's attorney, if any, will be notified of any remaining servicing options under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, that were not exhausted prior to filing bankruptcy or during the bankruptcy proceedings according to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No notices will be sent if the account was previously accelerated, such action is inconsistent with the provisions of the confirmed bankruptcy plan or the Bankruptcy Code, or the case

has been referred to the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a borrower operating under a confirmed bankruptcy plan desires to apply for loan servicing and qualifies for servicing under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, the borrower must also comply with Bankruptcy Code rules and requirements concerning modification of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bankruptcy is dismissed without a confirmed plan. If the borrower's bankruptcy is dismissed without a confirmed plan, and the borrower is in default on Farm Loan Programs loans, the borrower's account will be liquidated after all remaining servicing options under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S are exhausted. The borrower will be notified of any servicing options remaining according to 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, no notices will be sent if the account was previously accelerated, the Agency is advised that such an act is inconsistent with the confirmed bankruptcy plan or the Bankruptcy Code, or the account has been referred to the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bankruptcy is dismissed after a confirmed reorganization plan. If a bankruptcy is dismissed after a reorganization plan was confirmed, the account will be serviced as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the borrower has substantially complied with the plan, but later defaults for reasons beyond the borrower's control, (see 7 CFR 1951.909(c)), the borrower will be notified of loan servicing in accordance with 7 CFR 1951.907. No notices will be sent if the account was previously accelerated; such action is inconsistent with the provisions of the confirmed bankruptcy plan or the Bankruptcy Code; or the case has been referred to the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the borrower failed to make one full payment under the plan, or did not comply with the plan for reasons not beyond the borrower's control, the borrower will be serviced according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Servicing of bankruptcy loans after the case is closed. In chapter 11, 12, or 13 cases after the case is closed and the discharge order is issued by the court, if the borrower becomes delinquent after performing as agreed under the plan, the borrower will be sent a notice explaining the loan servicing options available under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S. The borrower's attorney of record will be sent a courtesy copy if the bankruptcy has not been closed for at least 2 years. No notices will be sent if the account has been accelerated, such act is inconsistent with the provisions of a confirmed bankruptcy plan or other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, or the account has been referred to the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liquidation. The account will be liquidated after obtaining any necessary relief, if required, from the automatic stay. In chapter 7 cases after discharge, the account can be liquidated if the debt has not been reaffirmed and the property is no longer part of the estate. Liquidation can proceed prior to discharge if allowed by the court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the borrower or borrower's attorney was not previously notified of any remaining servicing options available under 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S before or during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, the borrower and the borrower's attorney will be sent the notices referenced in paragraph (c) of this section prior to liquidating any security property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the borrower or the borrower's attorney had been previously notified of loan servicing options remaining, the account will be liquidated.
