MSS ATC base stations located within radio  line of sight of a MAT receiver must be coordinated with the Aerospace  and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC) for non-Government  MAT receivers on a case-by-case basis prior to operation. For government  MAT receivers, the MSS licensee shall supply sufficient information to  the Commission to allow coordination to take place. A listing of current  and planned MAT receiver sites can be obtained from AFTRCC for non- Government sites and through the FCC's IRAC Liaison for Government MAT  receiver sites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> ATC mobile terminals shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be limited to a peak EIRP level of 0 dBW and an out-of-channel  emissions of -67 dBW/4 kHz at the edge of an MSS licensee's authorized  and internationally coordinated MSS frequency assignment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be operated in a fashion that takes all practicable steps to  avoid causing interference to U.S. radio astronomy service (RAS)  observations in the 1660-1660.5 MHz band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not generate EIRP density, averaged over any two-millisecond  active transmission interval, greater than -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1605  MHz band or greater than a level determined by linear interpolation in  the 1605-1610 MHz band, from -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to -46 dBW/MHz at  1610 MHz. The EIRP, averaged over any two-millisecond active  transmission interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than  700 Hz bandwidth from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW in  the 1559-1605 MHz band or exceed a level determined by linear  interpolation in the 1605-1610 MHz band, from -80 dBW at 1605 MHz to -56  dBW at 1610 MHz. The EIRP density of carrier-off-state emissions from  such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 MHz  band, averaged over a two-millisecond interval. A root-mean-square  detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or  equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to measure wideband  EIRP density for purposes of this rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be  measured with a root-mean-square detector function with a resolution  bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When implementing multiple base stations and/or base stations  using multiple carriers, where any third-order intermodulation product  of these base stations falls on an L-band MSS band coordinated for use  by another MSS operator with rights to the coordinated band, the MSS ATC  licensee must notify the MSS operator. The MSS operator may request  coordination to modify the base station carrier frequencies, or to  reduce the maximum base station EIRP on the frequencies contributing to  the third-order intermodulation products. The threshold for this  notification and coordination is when the sum of the calculated signal  levels received by an MSS receiver exceeds -70 dBm. The MSS receiver  used in these calculations can be assumed to have an antenna with 0 dBi  gain. Free-space propagation between the base station antennas and the  MSS terminals can be assumed and actual signal polarizations for the ATC  signals and the MSS system may be used.
