A conviction in absentia shall not  constitute a conviction within the meaning of INA 212(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of pardon by appropriate U.S. authorities/foreign states.  An alien shall not be considered ineligible under INA 212(a)(2)(B) by  reason in part of having been convicted of an offense for which a full  and unconditional pardon has been granted by the President of the United  States, by the Governor of a State of the United States, by the former  High Commissioner for Germany acting pursuant to Executive Order 10062,  or by the United States Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany  acting pursuant to Executive Order 10608. A legislative pardon or a  pardon, amnesty, expungement of penal record or any other act of  clemency granted by a foreign state shall not serve to remove a ground  of ineligibility under INA 212(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Political offense. The term ``purely political offense'', as  used in INA 212(a)(2)(B), includes offenses that resulted in convictions  obviously based on fabricated charges or predicated upon repressive  measures against racial, religious, or political minorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver of ineligibility--INA 212(h). If an immigrant visa  applicant is ineligible under INA 212(a)(2)(B) but is qualified to seek  the benefits of INA 212(h), the consular officer shall inform the alien  of the procedure for applying to DHS for relief under that provision of  law. A visa may not be issued to the alien until the consular officer  has received notification from DHS of the approval of the alien's  application under INA 212(h).
