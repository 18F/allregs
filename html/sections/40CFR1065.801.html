                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart applies for testing with oxygenated fuels. Unless the standard-setting part specifies otherwise, the requirements of this subpart do not apply for fuels that contain less than 25% oxygenated compounds by volume. For example, you generally do not need to follow the requirements of this subpart for tests performed using a fuel containing 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, but you must follow these requirements for tests performed using a fuel containing 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1065.805 applies for all other testing that requires measurement of any alcohols or carbonyls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart specifies sampling procedures and calculations that are different than those used for non-oxygenated fuels. All other test procedures of this part 1065 apply for testing with oxygenated fuels.</p>
