                            <p class="depth0">A Federal prisoner committed under the Narcotic Addict  Rehabilitation Act may be released on parole in the discretion of the  Commission after completion of at least six months in treatment, not  including any period of time for ``study'' prior to final judgment of  the court. Before parole is ordered by the Commission, the Surgeon  General or his designated representative must certify that the prisoner  has made sufficient progress to warrant his release   and the Attorney General or his designated representative must also  report to the Commission whether the prisoner should be released.  Recertification by the Surgeon General prior to reparole consideration  is not required (18 U.S.C. 4254).  [48 FR 22918, May 23, 1983]</p>
