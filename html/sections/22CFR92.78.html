(However,  see Sec. 92.56 with regard to interpreting and translating services  which may be performed in connection with depositions.) They are  authorized to administer to a translator an oath as to the correctness  of a translation; to take an acknowledgment of the preparation of a  translation; and to authenticate the seal and signature of a local  official affixed to a translation. Separate fees should be charged for  each of these services, as indicated under the caption ``Notarial  Services and Authentications'' of the Tariff of Fees, Foreign Service of  the United States of America (Sec. 22.1 of this chapter).</p>
