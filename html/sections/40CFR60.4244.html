If your stationary SI internal combustion engine is non-operational, you do not need to startup the engine solely to conduct a performance test; however, you must conduct the performance test immediately upon startup of the engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 60.8(f). Each test run must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak (or the highest achievable) load and last at least 1 hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To determine compliance with the NOX mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of NOX in the engine exhaust using Equation 1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA08.000

The results from Method 18 and Method 320 can be corrected for response factor differences using Equations 4 and 5 of this section.
