                            <p class="depth0">Applicability. Section 86.132-96 (a) through (c)(1) and (d) through (m) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section are applicable to FTP and evaporative emission testing. Paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section are applicable to vehicles tested for the SFTP supplemental tests of aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03). Section 86.132-00 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from Sec. 86.132-96. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.132-96 is identical and applicable to Sec. 86.132-00, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.132-96.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)-(c)(1)</em> [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.132-96.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)(i)</em> Once a test vehicle has completed the refueling and vehicle soak steps specified in Sec. 86.132-96 (b) and (c)(1), these steps may be omitted in subsequent testing with the same vehicle and the same fuel specifications, provided the vehicle remains under laboratory ambient temperature conditions for at least 6 hours before starting the next test. In such cases, each subsequent test shall begin with the preconditioning drive specified in Sec. 86.132-96(c)(1). The test vehicle may not be used to set dynamometer horsepower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Once a test vehicle has completed the refueling and vehicle soak steps specified in Sec. 86.132-96 (b) and (c)(1), these steps may be omitted in subsequent testing with the same vehicle and the same fuel specifications, provided the vehicle remains under laboratory ambient temperature conditions for at least 6 hours before starting the next test.

The test vehicle may not be used to set dynamometer horsepower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The SFTP test elements of aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03) can be run immediately or up to 72 hours after the official FTP and/or evaporative test sequence without refueling provided the vehicle has remained under laboratory ambient temperature conditions. If the time interval exceeds 72 hours or the vehicle leaves the ambient temperature conditions of the laboratory, the manufacturer must repeat the refueling operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)-(m)</em> [Reserved].

(1) If the US06 test follows the exhaust emission FTP or evaporative testing, the refueling step may be deleted and the vehicle may be preconditioned using the fuel remaining in the tank (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The test vehicle may be pushed or driven onto the test dynamometer. Acceptable cycles for preconditioning are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the US06 test follows the exhaust emission FTP or evaporative testing, the refueling step may be deleted and the vehicle may be preconditioned using the fuel remaining in the tank (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).

Acceptable cycles for preconditioning are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preconditioning may consist of a 505, 866, highway, US06 or SC03 test cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a manufacturer has concerns about fuel effects on adaptive memory systems, a manufacturer may precondition a test vehicle on test fuel and the US06 cycle. Upon request from a manufacturer, the administrator will also perform the preconditioning with the US06 cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The preconditioning cycles for the US06 test schedule are conducted at the same ambient test conditions as the certification US06 test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Following the preconditioning specified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the test vehicle is returned to idle for one to two minutes before the start of the official US06 test cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Air Conditioning Test (SC03) Preconditioning. (1) If the SC03 test follows the exhaust emission FTP or evaporative testing, the refueling step may be deleted and the vehicle may be preconditioned using the fuel remaining in the tank (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The test vehicle may be pushed or driven onto the test dynamometer.

Manufacturers, at their option, may elect to use the preconditioning in paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section when the soak period exceeds two hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Following the preconditioning specified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the test vehicle is turned off, the vehicle cooling fan(s) is turned off, and the vehicle is allowed to soak for 10 minutes prior to the start of the official SC03 test cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The preconditioning cycles for the SC03 air conditioning test and the 10 minute soak are conducted at the same ambient test conditions as the SC03 certification air conditioning test.
