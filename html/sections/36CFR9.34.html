Failure to so notify the Superintendent shall render the approval of any previously approved plan of operations void.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transferring owner shall remain responsible for compliance with the plan of operations and shall remain liable under his bond until such time as the Superintendent is notified of the transfer in accordance with paragraph (a). At that time the Superintendent will prohibit the new owner from operating until such time as the new owner has filed with the Superintendent: (1) A statement ratifying the existing plan of operations and stating his intent to be bound thereby, or a new plan of operations, and (2) a suitable substitute performance bond which complies with the requirements of Sec. 9.48.</p>
