                                Sec. 390.341  Inclusion of subordinated debt securities and mandatorily
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. A State savings association must comply with this section  in order to include subordinated debt securities or mandatorily  redeemable preferred stock (``covered securities'') in supplementary  capital (tier 2 capital) under subpart Z. If a State savings association  does not include covered securities in supplementary capital, it is not  required to comply with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application and notice procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State savings  association must file an application or notice under Sec. Sec. 390.103  through 390.110 seeking FDIC approval of, or non-objection to, the  inclusion of covered securities in supplementary capital. The State  savings association may file its application or notice before or after  it issues covered securities, but may not include covered securities in  supplementary capital until the FDIC approves the application or does  not object to the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State savings association must also comply with the securities  offering rules at subpart W by filing an offering circular for a  proposed issuance of covered securities, unless the offering qualifies  for an exemption under that subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Securities requirements. To be included in supplementary  capital, covered securities must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each certificate evidencing a covered security must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Bear the following legend on its face, in bold type: ``This  security is not a savings account or deposit and it is not insured by  the United States or any agency or fund of the United States;''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> State that the security is subordinated on liquidation, as to  principal, interest, and premium, to all claims against the State  savings association that have the same priority as savings accounts or a  higher priority;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> State that the security is not secured by the State savings  association's assets or the assets of any affiliate of the State savings  association. For purposes of this subpart, the term affiliate means any  person or company which controls, is controlled by, or is under common  control with such State savings association.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> State that the security is not eligible collateral for a loan by  the State savings association;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> State the prohibition on the payment of dividends or interest at  12   U.S.C. 1828(b) and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, state  the prohibition on the payment of principal and interest at 12 U.S.C.  1831o(h);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> For subordinated debt securities, state or refer to a document  stating the terms under which the State savings association may prepay  the obligation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> State or refer to a document stating that the State savings  association must obtain FDIC approval before the voluntarily prepayment  of principal on subordinated debt securities, the acceleration of  payment of principal on subordinated debt securities, or the voluntarily  redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (other than  scheduled redemptions), if the State savings association is  undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically  undercapitalized as described in Sec. 390.453(4)(b), fails to meet the  regulatory capital requirements at subpart Z, or would fail to meet any  of these standards following the payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State savings association must include such additional  statements as the FDIC may prescribe for certificates, purchase  agreements, indentures, and other related documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maturity requirements. Covered securities must have an original  weighted average maturity or original weighted average period to  required redemption of at least five years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mandatory prepayment. Subordinated debt securities and related  documents may not provide events of default or contain other provisions  that could result in a mandatory prepayment of principal, other than  events of default that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arise from the State savings association's failure to make  timely payment of interest or principal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Arise from its failure to comply with reasonable financial,  operating, and maintenance covenants of a type that are customarily  included in indentures for publicly offered debt securities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Relate to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar  events.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indenture. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of  this section, a State savings association must use an indenture for  subordinated debt securities. If the aggregate amount of subordinated  debt securities publicly offered (excluding sales in a non-public  offering as defined in Sec. 390.413 and sold in any consecutive 12-month  or 36-month period exceeds $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 respectively (or  such lesser amount that the Securities and Exchange Commission shall  establish by rule or regulation under 15 U.S.C. 77ddd), the indenture  must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than the State  savings association or an affiliate of the State savings association (as  defined atSec. 390.283) and for collective enforcement of the security  holders' rights and remedies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State savings association is not required to use an indenture  if the subordinated debt securities are sold only to accredited  investors, as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. 77d(6). A State savings  association must have an indenture that meets the requirements of  paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section in place before any debt securities  for which an exemption from the indenture requirement is claimed, are  transferred to any non-accredited investor. If a State savings  association relies on this exemption from the indenture requirement, it  must place a legend on the debt securities indicating that an indenture  must be in place before the debt securities are transferred to any non- accredited investor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FDIC review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC will review notices and applications  under Sec. Sec. 390.126 through 390.135.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In reviewing notices and applications under this section, the  FDIC will consider whether:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issuance of the covered securities is authorized under  applicable laws and regulations and is consistent with the State savings  association's charter and bylaws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State savings association is at least adequately  capitalized under Sec. 390.453(4)(b) and meets the regulatory capital  requirements at subpart Z.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State savings association is or will be able to service  the covered securities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The covered securities are consistent with the requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The covered securities and related transactions sufficiently  transfer risk from the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The FDIC has no objection to the issuance based on the State  savings association's overall policies, condition, and operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC approval or non-objection is conditioned upon no  material changes to the information disclosed in the application or  notice submitted to the FDIC. The FDIC may impose such additional  requirements or conditions as it may deem necessary to protect  purchasers, the State savings association, or the Deposit Insurance  Fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendments. If a State savings association amends the covered  securities or related documents following the completion of the FDIC's  review, it must obtain the FDIC's approval or non-objection under this  section before it may include the amended securities in supplementary  capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sale of covered securities. The State savings association must  complete the sale of covered securities within one year after the FDIC's  approval or non-objection under this section. A State savings  association may request an extension of the offering period by filing a  written request with the FDIC. The State savings association must  demonstrate good cause for the extension and file the request at least  30 days before the expiration of the offering period or any extension of  the offering period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reports. A State savings association must file the following  information with the FDIC within 30 days after the State savings  association completes the sale of covered securities includable as  supplementary capital. If the State savings association filed its  application or notice following the completion of the sale, it must  submit this information with its application or notice:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written report indicating the number of purchasers, the total  dollar amount of securities sold, the net proceeds received by the State  savings association from the issuance, and the amount of covered  securities, net of all expenses, to be included as supplementary  capital;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three copies of an executed form of the securities and a copy of  any related documents governing the issuance or administration of the  securities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A certification by the appropriate executive officer indicating  that the State savings association complied with all applicable laws and  regulations in connection with the offering, issuance, and sale of the  securities.</p>
