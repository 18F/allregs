                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an  indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services  during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual  requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as  dollar values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The contract must require the Government to order and the  contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or  services. In addition, if ordered, the contractor must furnish any  additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting  officer should establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on market  research, trends on recent contracts for similar supplies or services,  survey of potential users, or any other rational basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity  must be more than a nominal quantity, but it should not exceed the  amount that the Government is fairly certain to order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that  the Government may order under each task or delivery order and the  maximum that it may order during a specific period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A solicitation and contract for an indefinite quantity must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specify the period of the contract, including the number of  options and the period for which the Government may extend the contract  under each option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specify the total minimum and maximum quantity of supplies or  services the Government will acquire under the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Include a statement of work, specifications, or other  description, that reasonably describes the general scope, nature,  complexity, and purpose of the supplies or services the Government will  acquire under the contract in a manner that will enable a prospective  offeror to decide whether to submit an offer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> State the procedures that the Government will use in issuing  orders, including the ordering media, and, if multiple awards may be  made, state the procedures and selection criteria that the Government  will use to provide awardees a fair opportunity to be considered for  each order (see 16.505(b)(1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Include the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number,  and e-mail address of the agency task and delivery order ombudsman (see  16.505(b)(8)) if multiple awards may be made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Include a description of the activities authorized to issue  orders; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Include authorization for placing oral orders, if appropriate,  provided that the Government has established procedures for obligating  funds and that oral orders are confirmed in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application. Contracting officers may use an indefinite-quantity  contract when the Government cannot predetermine, above a specified  minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the  Government will require during the contract period, and it is  inadvisable for the Government to commit itself for more than a minimum  quantity. The contracting officer should use an indefinite-quantity  contract only when a recurring need is anticipated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Multiple award preference--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Planning the acquisition. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Except for indefinite-quantity contracts for advisory and assistance  services as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the  contracting officer must, to the maximum extent practicable, give  preference to making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts  under a single solicitation for the same or similar supplies or services  to two or more sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contracting officer must determine whether multiple  awards are appropriate as part of acquisition planning. The contracting  officer must avoid situations in which awardees specialize exclusively  in one or a few areas within the statement of work, thus creating the  likelihood that orders in those areas will be awarded on a sole-source  basis; however, each awardee need not be capable of performing every  requirement as well as any other awardee under the contracts. The  contracting officer should consider the following when determining the  number of contracts to be awarded:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The scope and complexity of the contract requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The expected duration and frequency of task or delivery orders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The mix of resources a contractor must have to perform expected  task or delivery order requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The ability to maintain competition among the awardees  throughout the contracts' period of performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contracting officer must not use the multiple award approach  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Only one contractor is capable of providing performance at the  level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or  highly specialized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Based on the contracting officer's knowledge of the market, more  favorable terms and conditions, including pricing, will be provided if a  single award is made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The expected cost of administration of multiple contracts  outweighs the expected benefits of making multiple awards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The projected orders are so integrally related that only a  single contractor can reasonably perform the work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The total estimated value of the contract is less than the  simplified acquisition threshold; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiple awards would not be in the best interests of the  Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The contracting officer must document the decision whether or  not to use multiple awards in the acquisition plan or contract file. The  contracting officer may determine that a class of acquisitions is not  appropriate for multiple awards (see subpart 1.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(1)</em> No task or delivery order contract in an amount estimated to  exceed $112 million (including all options) may be awarded to a single  source unless the head of the agency determines in writing that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The task or delivery orders expected under the contract are so  integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform the  work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract provides only for firm-fixed price (see 16.202)  task or delivery orders for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Products for which unit prices are established in the contract;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Services for which prices are established in the contract for  the specific tasks to be performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Only one source is qualified and capable of performing the  work at a reasonable price to the Government; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> It is necessary in the public interest to award the contract to  a single source due to exceptional circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The head of the agency must notify Congress within 30 days after  any determination under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requirement for a determination for a single-award contract  greater than $112 million--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is in addition to any applicable requirements of Subpart 6.3;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is not applicable for architect-engineer services awarded  pursuant to Subpart 36.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracts for advisory and assistance services. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if an indefinite- quantity contract for advisory and assistance services exceeds 3 years  and $13.5 million, including all options, the contracting officer must  make multiple awards unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contracting officer or other official designated by the head  of the   agency determines in writing, as part of acquisition planning, that  multiple awards are not practicable. The contracting officer or other  official must determine that only one contractor can reasonably perform  the work because either the scope of work is unique or highly  specialized or the tasks so integrally related;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contracting officer or other official designated by the head  of the agency determines in writing, after the evaluation of offers,  that only one offeror is capable of providing the services required at  the level of quality required; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Only one offer is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section do not  apply if the contracting officer or other official designated by the  head of the agency determines that the advisory and assistance services  are incidental and not a significant component of the contract.
