The issues before the ALJ include all the issues  brought out in the coverage determination, redetermination, or  reconsideration that were not decided entirely in an enrollee's favor.  However, if evidence presented before the hearing causes the ALJ to  question a favorable portion of the determination, he or she notifies  the enrollee before the hearing and may consider it an issue at the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New issues--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The ALJ may consider a new issue at the  hearing if he or she notifies the enrollee about the new issue any time  before the start of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content of the new issues. The new issue may include issues  resulting from the participation of CMS, the IRE, and/or the Part D plan  sponsor at the ALJ level of adjudication and from any evidence and  position papers submitted by CMS, the IRE, and/or the Part D plan  sponsor for the first time to the ALJ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consideration of new issues.
