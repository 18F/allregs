                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Act means the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and  the Consumer Leasing Act is chapter 5 of the Truth in Lending Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advertisement means a commercial message in any medium that  directly or indirectly promotes a consumer lease transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Board refers to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Closed-end lease means a consumer lease other than an open-end  lease as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consumer lease means a contract in the form of a bailment or  lease for the use of personal property by a natural person primarily for  personal, family, or household purposes, for a period exceeding four  months and for a total contractual obligation not exceeding the  applicable threshold amount, whether or not the lessee has the option to  purchase or otherwise become the owner of the property at the expiration  of the lease. The threshold amount is adjusted annually to reflect  increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and  Clerical Workers, as applicable. See the official staff commentary to  this paragraph (e) for the threshold amount applicable to a specific  consumer lease. Unless the context indicates otherwise, in this part  ``lease'' means ``consumer lease.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term does not include a lease that meets the definition of a  credit sale in Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.2(a)). It also does not include  a lease for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes or a lease  made to an organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This part does not apply to a lease transaction of personal  property which is incident to the lease of real property and which  provides that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lessee has no liability for the value of the personal  property at the end of the lease term except for abnormal wear and tear;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lessee has no option to purchase the leased property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Gross capitalized cost means the amount agreed upon by the  lessor and the lessee as the value of the leased property and any items  that are capitalized or amortized during the lease term, including but  not limited to taxes, insurance, service agreements, and any outstanding  prior credit or lease balance. Capitalized cost reduction means the  total amount of any rebate, cash payment, net trade-in allowance, and  noncash credit that reduces the gross capitalized cost. The adjusted  capitalized cost equals the gross capitalized cost less the capitalized  cost reduction, and is the amount used by the lessor in calculating the  base periodic payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Lessee means a natural person who enters into or is offered a  consumer lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Lessor means a person who regularly leases, offers to lease, or  arranges for the lease of personal property under a consumer lease. A  person who has leased, offered, or arranged to lease personal property  more than five times in the preceding calendar year or more than five  times in the current calendar year is subject to the act and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Open-end lease means a consumer lease in which the lessee's  liability at the end of the lease term is based on the difference  between the residual value of the leased property and its realized  value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Organization means a corporation, trust, estate, partnership,  cooperative, association, or government entity or instrumentality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Person means a natural person or an organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Personal property means any property that is not real property  under the law of the state where the property is located at the time it  is offered or made available for lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Realized value means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The price received by the lessor for the leased property at  disposition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The highest offer for disposition of the leased property; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fair market value of the leased property at the end of the  lease term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Residual value means the value of the leased property at the end  of the lease term, as estimated or assigned at consummation by the  lessor, used in calculating the base periodic payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Security interest and security mean any interest in property  that secures the payment or performance of an obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> State means any state, the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the  United States.
