Within 10 business days of the oral notification, the Observer Program will notify the observer candidate in writing. The written notification will specify why the candidate failed the training and whether the candidate may retake the training.

A certification training endorsement signifies the successful completion of the training course required to obtain this endorsement. A certification training endorsement is required for any deployment as an observer in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands groundfish fisheries and the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries or Halibut Act fisheries and will be granted with the initial issuance of an observer certification. This endorsement expires when the observer has not been deployed and performed sampling duties as required by the Observer Program for a period of time specified by the Observer Program after his or her most recent debriefing. In order to renew the endorsement, the observer must successfully retake the certification training. Observers will be notified of any changes to the endorsement expiration period prior to the effective date of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annual general endorsement. Each observer must obtain an annual general endorsement to their certification prior to his or her initial deployment within any calendar year subsequent to a calendar year in which a certification training endorsement is obtained.

All briefing attendance, performance, and conduct standards required by the Observer Program must be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deployment endorsements. Each observer who has completed an initial deployment after certification or annual briefing must receive a deployment endorsement to their certification prior to any subsequent deployments for the remainder of that year.

The Regional Administrator will establish an observer suspension and

decertification review official(s), who will have the authority to review observer certifications issued under paragraph (a) of this section and issue initial administrative determinations of observer certification suspension and/or decertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Causes for suspension or decertification. The suspension/decertification official may initiate suspension or decertification proceedings against an observer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When it is alleged that the observer has committed any acts or omissions of any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Failed to satisfactorily perform the duties of an observer as specified in writing by the Observer Program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Failed to abide by the standards of conduct for an observer as prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon conviction of a crime or upon entry of a civil judgment for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Commission of fraud or other violation in connection with obtaining or attempting to obtain certification, or in performing the duties as specified in writing by the Observer Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of integrity or honesty that seriously and directly affects the fitness of observers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Issuance of initial administrative determination. Upon determination that suspension or decertification is warranted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the suspension/decertification official will issue a written initial administrative determination (IAD) to the observer via certified mail at the observer's most current address provided to NMFS under Sec. 679.43(e). The IAD will identify whether a certification is suspended or revoked and will identify the specific reasons for the action taken. If the IAD issues a suspension for an observer certification, the terms of the suspension will be specified. Suspension or decertification can be made effective upon issuance of the IAD in cases of willfulness or in cases in which public health, interest, or safety require such action. In such cases, the suspension/decertification official will state in the IAD that suspension or decertification is effective at time of issuance and the reason for the action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appeals. A certified observer who receives an IAD that suspends or revokes his or her observer certification may appeal pursuant to Sec. 679.43.
