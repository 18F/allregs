Such fees shall not exceed $25.00, unless the requester has authorized a higher amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before the Commission begins processing a request or discloses any information, it will require advance payment if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Charges are estimated to exceed $250.00 and the requester has no history of payment and cannot provide satisfactory assurance that payment will be made; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A requester failed to pay the Commission for a previous Freedom of Information Act request within 30 days of the billing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission will aggregate requests, for the purposes of billing, whenever it reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to separate a request into more than one request for the purpose of evading fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a requester's total bill is less than $9.00, the Commission will not request payment.
