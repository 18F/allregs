                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For prudential, supervisory, or enforcement  reasons, the OCC may require a foreign bank to hold certain assets in  the state in which its Federal branch or agency is located. Those assets  may only consist of currency, bonds, notes, debentures, drafts, bills of  exchange, or other evidence of indebtedness including loan participation  agreements or certificates, or other obligations payable in the United  States or in United States funds or, with the approval of the OCC, funds  freely convertible into United States funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the OCC requires asset maintenance, the amount of assets held  by a foreign bank shall be prescribed by the OCC after consideration of  the aggregate amount of liabilities of the Federal branch or agency,  payable at or through the Federal branch or agency. To determine the  aggregate amount of liabilities for purposes of this section, the  foreign bank shall include bankers' acceptances, but exclude liabilities  to   the head office and any other branches, offices, agencies, subsidiaries,  and affiliates of the foreign bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuation. For the purposes of this section, marketable  securities must be valued at principal amount or market value, whichever  is lower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credits. In determining compliance with the asset maintenance  requirements, the OCC will give the Federal branch or agency credit for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Capital equivalency deposits maintained pursuant to Sec. 28.15;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reserves required to be maintained by the Federal branch or  agency pursuant to the FRB's authority under 12 U.S.C. 3105(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets pledged, and surety bonds payable, to the FDIC to secure  the payment of domestic deposits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exclusions. In determining eligible assets for purposes of this  section, the Federal branch or agency shall exclude:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any amount due from the head office or any other branch, office,  agency, subsidiary, or affiliate of the foreign bank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any classified asset;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any asset that, in the determination of the OCC, is not  supported by sufficient credit information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any deposit with a bank in the United States, unless that bank  has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any asset not in the Federal branch's actual possession unless  the branch holds title to the asset and maintains records sufficient to  enable independent verification of the branch's ownership of the asset,  as determined at the most recent examination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other particular asset or class of assets as provided by the  OCC, based on a case-by-case assessment of the risks associated with the  asset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> International banking facility. Unless specifically exempted by  the OCC, the eligible assets and liabilities of any international  banking facility operated through the Federal branch or agency must be  included in the computation of eligible assets and liabilities for  purposes of this section.
