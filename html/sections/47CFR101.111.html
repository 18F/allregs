The emission mask limitation shall only apply at the 12.2-12.7 GHz band edges and does not restrict MVDDS channelization bandwidth within the band.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For operating frequencies above 15 GHz, in any 1 MHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less than 11 decibels:

The emission mask can be satisfied by locating a carrier of the subchannel sufficiently far from the channel edges so that the emission levels of the mask are satisfied. The LMDS or 24 GHz emission mask shall use a value B (bandwidth) of 40 MHz, for all cases even in the case where a narrower subchannel is used (for instance the actual bandwidth is 10 MHz) and the mean output power used in the calculation is the sum of the output power of a fully populated channel.

The value of P in the equation is for the percentage removed from the carrier frequency and assumes that the carrier frequency is the center of the actual bandwidth used. The value of B will always be 500 MHz. In the case where a narrower sub-channel is used within the assigned bandwidth, such sub-carrier will be located sufficiently far from the channel edges to satisfy the emission levels of the mask.
