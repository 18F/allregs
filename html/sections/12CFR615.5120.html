                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limitations. Eligibility to purchase Farm Credit Investment  Bonds shall be limited to members and employees of the Farm Credit banks  and associations, except any bank officers, directors, and employees who  are involved in setting the term or rate, to retired employees who are  beneficiaries of a pension or retirement program of the Farm Credit  banks or associations, and to retired employees of the Farm Credit  Administration. A member of a Farm Credit association or a bank for  cooperatives need not be an active borrower to be eligible. A member of  any Farm Credit institution may purchase investment bonds from any of  the institutions in the district which offer the purchase program.  Patrons, members, employees, or stockholder of other financing  institutions discounting loans with a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural  credit bank or of any legal entity which is a borrower from any Farm  Credit institution as   such are ineligible as they are not members of a Farm Credit  institution. Stock or participation certificates shall not be sold  merely to qualify a party for the purchase of Farm Credit Investment  Bonds. For purposes of this section ``member'' means a stockholder or  participation certificate holder who acquired stock or participation  certificates to obtain a loan, to purchase stock for investment or to  qualify for other services of the association or bank. A person who  assumes a loan is not a member unless he becomes a stockholder or  participation certificate holder in connection with that loan. Employee  means a regular full-time employee of a Farm Credit bank or association.  Retired employee means a retiree who is a direct beneficiary of a  pension or retirement program of a Farm Credit bank or association or  the Farm Credit Administration under civil service retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and ownership. Farm Credit Investment Bonds are registered  bonds issued in definitive or book-entry form depending on investor  preference. The registration used must express the actual ownership of  an interest in the bond and will be considered by the issuing  institution as conclusive of such ownership and interest. No designation  of an attorney, agent, or other representative to request or receive  payment on behalf of the owner or coowner, nor any restriction on the  right of the owner or coowner to receive payment of the bond or  interest, except as provided in this section may be made in the  registration or otherwise. Registrations requested in applications for  the purchase shall be clear, accurate, complete, and conform with one of  the registration provisions set forth in this section, and include the  appropriate taxpayer identifying number. Registrations requested will be  inscribed on the face of the bond if in definitive form or on the  confirmation of investment if in book-entry form. The following  provisions shall apply for registration of Farm Credit Investment Bonds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In all cases the member's name (whether a natural person,  fiduciary, or legal entity) or employee's name must appear as owner of  the bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A bond may be registered in the name of a fiduciary only if the  fiduciary is in fact the member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A member or employee may not use a form of registration (such as  a gift to a minor, irrevocable trust, etc.) which would divest himself  of ownership. However, a minor may be named as coowner or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a member is a natural person, a second natural person, member  or nonmember, may be named as coowner or beneficiary. Coownership may  not involve a fiduciary or private organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the coownership form the connective ``or'' shall serve the  same purpose as ``joint tenants with right of survivorship.''
