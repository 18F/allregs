                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Administration of the oath. A notary public, including one who  is a director but not an officer of the national bank, may administer  the oath of directors. Any person, other than an officer of the bank,  having an official seal and authorized by the state to administer oaths,  may also administer the oath.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Execution of the oath. Each director attending the organization  meeting shall execute either a joint or individual oath. A director not  attending the organization meeting (the first meeting after the election  of the directors) shall execute the individual oath. A director shall  take another oath upon re-election, notwithstanding uninterupted  service. Appropriate sample oaths are located in the ``Comptroller's  Corporate Manual''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing and recordkeeping. A national bank must file the original  executed oaths of directors with the OCC and retain a copy in the bank's  records in accordance with the Comptroller's Corporate Manual filing and  recordkeeping instructions for executed oaths of directors.
