In determining the amount of  assistance to an applicant, the Regional Administrator will consider the  Management Conference planning target, the extent to which the  applicant's Work Program is consistent with EPA guidance, and the  anticipated cost of the applicant's program relative to the proposed  outputs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction of assistance amount. If the Regional Administrator  determines that the proposed outputs do not justify the level of funding  requested, he will reduce the assistance amount. If the evaluation  indicates that the proposed outputs are not consistent with the  priorities contained in EPA guidance, the Regional Administrator may  reduce the assistance amount.</p>
