To do so, the use of a TIA must be justified based on:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The nature of the project, as discussed in Sec. 603.205;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The type of recipient, addressed in Sec. 603.210;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The recipient's commitment and cost sharing, as described in Sec. 603.215;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The degree of involvement of the Government program official, as discussed in Sec. 603.220; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contracting officer's judgment that the use of a TIA could benefit the RD&D; objectives in ways that likely would not happen if another type of instrument were used (i.e., a contract, grant or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate). Answers to the four questions in Sec. 603.225 form the basis for the contracting officer's judgment.</p>
