We apply to your unearned income the exclusions in Sec. 418.3350(c) in the order listed. However, we do not reduce your unearned income below zero, and we do not apply any unused unearned income exclusion to earned income except for the $20 per month exclusion described in Sec. 416.1124(c)(12) of this chapter. For purposes of determining eligibility for a subsidy and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we treat the $20 per month exclusion as a $240 per year exclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We do not count as income the unearned income described in Sec. 416.1124(b) and (c) of this chapter, except for paragraph (c)(13).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We do not count as income any dividends or interest earned on resources you or your spouse owns.
