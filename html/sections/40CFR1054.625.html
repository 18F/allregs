                                Sec.  1054.625  What requirements apply under the Transition Program
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section allow equipment manufacturers to  produce equipment with Class II engines that are subject to less  stringent exhaust emission standards after the Phase 3 emission  standards begin to apply. To be eligible to use these provisions, you  must follow all the instructions in this section. See Sec.  1054.626 for  requirements that apply specifically to companies that manufacture  equipment outside the United States and to companies that import such  equipment without manufacturing it. Engines and equipment you produce  under this section are exempt from the prohibitions in 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1) with respect to exhaust emissions, subject to the  provisions of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this  section, equipment exempted under this section must meet all applicable  requirements related to evaporative emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If you are an equipment manufacturer, you may introduce  into U.S. commerce limited numbers of nonroad equipment with Class II  engines exempted under this section. You may use the exemptions in this  section only if you have primary responsibility for designing and  manufacturing equipment and your manufacturing procedures include  installing some engines in this equipment. Consider all U.S.-directed  equipment production in showing that you meet the requirements of this  section, including those from any parent or subsidiary companies and  those from any other companies you license to produce equipment for you.  If you produce a type of equipment that has more than one engine, count  each engine separately. These provisions are available during the first  four model years that the Phase 3 exhaust emission standards apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allowances. Calculate how many pieces of equipment with exempted  engines you may produce under this section by determining your U.S.- directed production volume of equipment with Class II engines from  January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009, calculating your annual  average production for this period, and multiplying the average value by  0.3. The same calculation applies for small-volume equipment  manufacturers, except that average annual production is multiplied by  2.0. For companies with no eligible production in a given year,  calculate annual average production based only on those years in which  you produce equipment during the specified period with Class II engines  for sale in the United States. Use these allowances for equipment using  model year 2011 and later Class II engines. You may use these allowances  for equipment you produce before December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to exempted engines. You may use one of the following  approaches to get exempted engines under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and make them available to  the engine manufacturer for any auditing under the provisions of Sec.   1054.610. If you do not place the label we specify in paragraph (f) of  this section adjacent to the engine manufacturer's emission control  information label, you must   place an additional permanent label as close as possible to the engine's  emission control information label where it will be readily visible in  the final installation with at least the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following statement: ``THIS ENGINE MEETS PHASE 2 STANDARDS  UNDER Sec.  1054.625(c)(2).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inclusion of engines not subject to Phase 3 standards. The  following provisions apply to engines that are not subject to Phase 3  standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you use the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105(a) to use up your  inventories of engines not certified to new emission standards, do not  include these units in your count of equipment with exempted engines  under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> applies only if the engine has a  permanent label describing why it is exempted from the Phase 3  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standards. If you produce equipment with exempted engines under  this section, the engines must meet the Phase 2 emission standards  specified in 40 CFR part 90. Any equipment using exempted engines under  this section is also exempt from the running loss standard specified in  Sec.  1054.112.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Equipment labeling. You must add a permanent label, written  legibly in English, to the engine or another readily visible part of  each piece of equipment with exempted engines you produce under this  section. This label, which supplements the engine manufacturer's  emission control information label, must include at least the following  items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The calendar year in which the equipment is manufactured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An e-mail address and phone number to contact for further  information, or a Web site that includes this contact information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following statement: THIS EQUIPMENT [or identify the type of  equipment] HAS AN ENGINE THAT MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40  CFR 1054.625.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notification and reporting. You must notify us of your intent to  produce equipment under the provisions of this section and send us an  annual report to verify that you are not exceeding the production limits  for equipment with exempted engines, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer a written notice of your  intent before you use the provisions of this section including all the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your company's name and address, and your parent company's name  and address, if applicable. Also identify the names of any other  companies operating under the same parent company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name, phone number and e-mail address of a person to  contact for more information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The calendar years in which you expect to use the exemption  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The name and address of each company you expect to produce  engines for the equipment you manufacture under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How many pieces of equipment with exempted engines you may sell  under this section, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.  Include your production figures for the period from January 1, 2007  through December 31, 2009, including figures broken down by equipment  model and calendar year. You may send corrected figures with lower  production volumes anytime after your initial notification. To make a  correction for higher production volumes, send us the corrected figures  by September 30, 2010. We may ask you to give us additional information  to confirm your production figures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each year that you use the provisions of this section, send  the Designated Compliance Officer a written report by March 31 of the  following   year. Identify the following things in your report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total count of equipment with exempted engines you sold in  the preceding year, based on actual U.S.-directed production  information. If you produce equipment in the 2010 calendar year with  exempted engines from the 2011 model year, include these units in your  March 31, 2012 report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cumulative figures describing how many pieces of equipment with  exempted engines you have produced for all the years you used the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer of the engine installed in the equipment you  produce under this section, if this is different than you specified  under paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you send your initial notification under paragraph (g)(1) of  this section after the specified deadline, we may approve your use of  allowances under this section. In your request, describe why you were  unable to meet the deadline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recordkeeping. Keep the following records of all equipment with  exempted engines you produce under this section until at least December  31, 2019:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The model number for each piece of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detailed figures for determining how many pieces of equipment  with exempted engines you may produce under this section, as described  in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The notifications and reports we require under paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement. Producing more exempted engines or equipment than  we allow under this section or installing engines that do not meet the  emission standards of paragraph (e) of this section violates the  prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1). You must give us the records we  require under this section if we ask for them (see 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Provisions for engine manufacturers. As an engine manufacturer,  use one of the following approaches to produce exempted engines under  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> apply if you do not use  the delegated-assembly provisions of Sec.  1054.610 for any of the  engines in an engine family. You must have written assurance from  equipment manufacturers or your authorized distributors that they need a  certain number of exempted engines under this section. Keep these  records for at least five years after you stop producing engines under  this section. You must also send us an annual report of the engines you  produce under this section, as described under Sec.  1054.250(a). The  engines must meet the emission standards in paragraph (e) of this  section and you must meet all the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.265. You  must meet the labeling requirements in 40 CFR 90.114, but add the  following statement instead of the compliance statement in 40 CFR  90.114(b)(7): THIS ENGINE MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR  1054.625 AND MUST BE USED ONLY UNDER THOSE FLEXIBILITY PROVISIONS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following provisions apply if you notify us that you plan to  use the delegated-assembly provisions of Sec.  1054.610 for one or more  equipment manufacturers for an engine family:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include test data in your application for certification showing  that your engines will meet the standards specified in paragraph (e) of  this section if they have a noncatalyzed muffler in place of the  aftertreatment that is part of the certified configuration. Use good  engineering judgment for these measurements, which may involve sampling  exhaust upstream of the catalyst or operating the engine with a  noncatalyzed muffler. This may be based on emission measurements from  previous model years if the data is still appropriate for the current  engine configuration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Produce all your engines with the emission control information  label we specify in Sec.  1054.135. The engines must also be labeled as  specified in 40 CFR 1068.261.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include in the installation instructions required under Sec.   1054.610 any appropriate instructions or limitations on installing  noncatalyzed mufflers to ensure that the fully assembled engine will  meet the emission standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section.  You may identify an appropriate range of backpressures, but this may not  involve any instructions related to   changing the fuel system for different fueling rates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use one of the following approaches to properly account for  emission credits if your engine family generates exhaust emission  credits under subpart H of this part:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Multiply the credits calculated under Sec.  1054.705 by 0.9.  This is based on the expectation that equipment manufacturers will  modify 10 percent of the engines to no longer meet Phase 3 standards.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Include in your emission-credit calculations only those engines  for which you can establish that the equipment manufacturer did not use  the provisions of this section. This would involve an evaluation for  each affected equipment manufacturer. For example, under this provision  you may count emission credits for engines that you sell to equipment  manufacturers with which you have no contract for delegated assembly.  You may also count emission credits for engines that you sell to  equipment manufacturers with which you have a delegated-assembly  relationship if you confirm that the equipment manufacturer did not use  the provisions of this section for those engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Additional exemptions for mid-sized companies. If your annual  production of equipment with Class II engines in 2007, 2008, and 2009 is  between 5,000 and 50,000 units, you may request additional engine  allowances under this section. To do this, notify us by January 31, 2010  if you believe the provisions of this section will not allow you to sell  certain equipment models starting in the 2011 model year. In your  notification, show us that you will be able to produce a number of Class  II equipment models representing at least half your total U.S.-directed  production volume in the 2011 model year that will be compliant with all  Phase 3 exhaust and evaporative emission standards. Also describe why  you need more allowances under this section to accommodate anticipated  changes in engine designs resulting from engine manufacturers'  compliance with changing exhaust emission standards. Include a proposal  for the number of additional allowances you would need, with supporting  rationale. We may approve allowances up to a total of 100 percent of the  average annual U.S.-directed production volume you report under  paragraph (b) of this section (in place of the 30 percent that is  otherwise allowed).</p>
