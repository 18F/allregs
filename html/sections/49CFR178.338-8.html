                                Sec. 178.338-8  Pressure relief devices, piping, valves, and fittings.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pressure relief devices. Each tank pressure relief device must  be designed, constructed, and marked in accordance with Sec. 173.318(b)  of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Piping, valves, and fittings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The burst pressure of all  piping, pipe fittings, hoses and other pressure parts, except for pump  seals and pressure relief devices, must be at least 4 times the design  pressure of the tank. Additionally, the burst pressure may not be less  than 4 times any higher pressure to which each pipe, pipe fitting, hose  or other pressure part may be subjected to in service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pipe joints must be threaded, welded or flanged. If threaded  pipe is used, the pipe and fittings must be Schedule 80 weight or  heavier. Malleable metals must be used in the construction of valves and  fittings. Where copper tubing is permitted, joints shall be brazed or be  of equally strong metal union type. The melting point of the brazing  materials may not be lower than 1000 F. The method of joining tubing  may not reduce the strength of the tubing, such as by the cutting of  threads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each hose coupling must be designed for a pressure of at least  120 percent of the hose design pressure and so that there will be no  leakage when connected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Piping must be protected from damage due to thermal expansion  and contraction, jarring, and vibration. Slip joints are not authorized  for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All piping, valves and fittings on a cargo tank must be proved  free from leaks. This requirement is met when such piping, valves, and  fittings have been tested after installation with gas or air and proved  leak tight at not less than the design pressure marked on the cargo  tank. This requirement is applicable to all hoses used in a cargo tank,  except that hose may be tested before or after installation on the tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each valve must be suitable for the tank design pressure at the  tank design service temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All fittings must be rated for the maximum tank pressure and  suitable for the coldest temperature to which they will be subjected in  actual service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All piping, valves, and fittings must be grouped in the smallest  practicable space and protected from damage as required by Sec. 178.338- 10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When a pressure-building coil is used on a tank designed to  handle oxygen or flammable ladings, the vapor connection to that coil  must be provided with a valve or check valve as close to the tank shell  as practicable to prevent the loss of vapor from the tank in case of  damage to the coil. The liquid connection to that coil must also be  provided with a valve.  [Amdt. 178-77, 48 FR 27704, June 16, 1983, as amended by Amdt. 178-89,  54 FR 25019, June 12, 1989]</p>
