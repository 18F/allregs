                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with the May 2013 Executive Order on Making Open and  Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information, the Federal  awarding agency and the non-Federal entity should, whenever practicable,  collect, transmit, and store Federal award-related information in open  and machine readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper.  The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must always provide  or accept paper versions of Federal award-related information to and  from the non-Federal entity upon request. If paper copies are submitted,  the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must not require more  than an original and two copies. When original records are electronic  and cannot be altered, there is no need to create and retain paper  copies. When original records are paper, electronic versions may be  substituted through the use of duplication or other forms of electronic  media provided that they are subject to periodic quality control  reviews, provide reasonable safeguards against alteration, and remain  readable.</p>
