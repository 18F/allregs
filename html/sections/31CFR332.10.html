                            <p class="depth0">A Series H bond became eligible for redemption at par at any time  after six months from its issue date. To be redeemed, the bond must be  presented and surrendered, with a duly executed request for payment, to  a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch referred to in Sec. 332.12, or the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328. In any case  where bonds are surrendered for redemption in the month prior to an  interest payment date, redemption will not be deferred but will be made  in regular course, unless the presenter specifically requests that the  transaction be delayed until that date. A request to defer redemption  made more than one month preceding the interest payment date will not be  accepted.  [57 FR 14281, Apr. 17, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 10539, Mar. 4, 1994]</p>
