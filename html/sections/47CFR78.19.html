                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for CARS stations shall endeavor to select an  assignable frequency or frequencies which will be least likely to result  in interference to other licensees in the same area since the FCC itself  does not undertake frequency coordination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicants for CARS stations shall take full advantage of all  known techniques, such as the geometric arrangement of transmitters and  receivers, the use of minimum power required to provide the needed  service, and the use of highly directive transmitting and receiving  antenna systems, to prevent interference to the reception of television  STL, television intercity relay, and other CARS stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Radio Astronomy and Radio Research Installations. In order to  minimize harmful interference at the National Radio Astronomy  Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. Va., and  at the Naval Radio Research Observatory at Sugar Grove, Pendleton  County, W.Va., an applicant for authority to construct a CARS station,  except a CARS pickup station, or for authority to make changes in the  frequency, power, antenna height, or antenna directivity of an existing  station within the area bounded by 39[deg]15[min] N. on the north,  78[deg]30[min] W. on the east, 37[deg]30[min] N. on the south and  80[deg]30[min] W. on the west shall, at the time of filing such  application with the Commission, simultaneously notify the Director,  National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, Green Bank,  WV 24944, in writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed  station. Such notification shall include the geographical coordinates of  the antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed  frequency, type of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall  indicate in his application to the Commission the date notification was  made to the Observatory. After receipt of such application, the  Commission will allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in  response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed  operation is received during the 20-day period from the National Radio  Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio  Research Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the  problem and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicant for a new permanent base or fixed station  authorization to be located on the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo,  Mona, Vieques, and Culebra, or for a modification of an existing  authorization which would change the frequency, power, antenna   height, directivity, or location of a station on these islands and would  increase the likelihood of the authorized facility causing interference,  shall notify the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory, HC3 Box  53995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00612, in writing or electronically, of the  technical parameters of the proposal. Applicants may wish to consult  interference guidelines, which will be provided by Cornell University.  Applicants who choose to transmit information electronically should e- mail to: prcz@naic.edu.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory  shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the  application with the Commission. The notification shall state the  geographical coordinates of the transmit antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna  height above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna  directivity and gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of  emission, effective isotropic radiated power, and whether the proposed  use is itinerant. Generally, submission of the information in the  technical portion of the FCC license application is adequate  notification. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in its  application to the Commission the date notification was made to the  Arecibo Observatory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow  the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections  in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be  required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any  potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file  either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as  appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has  satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the  Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations  that transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder  County, Colorado: Applicants for a station authorization to operate in  the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to  give due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to  protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful  interference. These are the research laboratories of the Department of  Commerce, Boulder County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the  present ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of  Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated  signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 1800 acre site  (in the vicinity of coordinates 40[deg]07[min]50[sec] N Latitude,  105[deg]14[min]40[sec] W Longitude) resulting from new assignments  (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or relocation of  existing facilities do not exceed the following values:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">In authorized bandwidth</p><p class="depth2">of service</p><p class="depth2">-------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Frequency range                    Field      Power flux</p><p class="depth2">strength   density \1\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(mV/m)</em>     (dBW/m\2\) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Below 540 kHz.................................           10        -65.8 540 to 1600 kHz...............................           20        -59.8 1.6 to 470 MHz................................           10    \2\ -65.8 470 to 890 MHz................................           30    \2\ -56.2 Above 890 MHz.................................            1    \2\ -85.8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are caculated assuming free</p><p class="depth2">space characteristic impedance of 376.7 = 120[pi] ohms. \2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the</p><p class="depth2">earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but</p><p class="depth2">in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all</p><p class="depth2">angles of arrival.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance consultation is recomended particularly for those  applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field  strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be  exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In  such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining  whether coordination is recommended:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All stations within 2.4 km (1.5 statute miles);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stations within 4.8 km (3 statute miles) with 50 watts or more  effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in  the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stations within 16 km (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or more ERP  in the   primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table  Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Stations within 80 km (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or more ERP  in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the  Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio  Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research  Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303;  telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with  the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether  advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised  that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of  Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted  which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field  strength specified herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring  stations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a  radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or  changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength  produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are  advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the  possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference.  Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are  listed in Sec.  0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for  stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a  direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the  authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density  assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at the  referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible  interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and  existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at  the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station  may be added to the station authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10  mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m2) at the reference coordinates, or if there is any  question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold value,  advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection necessary  should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate with the  Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, Federal Communications  Commission, Washington, DC 20554.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those  applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field  strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by  their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such  instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an  applicant should coordinate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts  or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of  polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or  more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal  direction of the Monitoring Station;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or  more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal  direction of the Monitoring Station;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is  recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a  monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in  section 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria  outlined in paragraphs (f) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether  advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised  that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal  Communications   Commission or modification of any authorization which will cause harmful  interference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> 17.7-19.7 GHz band.
