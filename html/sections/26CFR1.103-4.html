                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issued before March 1, 1941. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest upon obligations of  the United States issued on or before September 1, 1917, is exempt from  tax. In the case of obligations issued by the United States after  September 1, 1917, and in the case of obligations of a corporation  organized under act of Congress, if such corporation is an  instrumentality of the United States, the interest is exempt from tax  only if and to the extent provided in the acts authorizing the issue  thereof, as amended and supplemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest on Treasury bonds issued before March 1, 1941, is  exempt from Federal income taxes except surtaxes imposed upon the income  or profits of individuals, associations, or corporations. However,  interest on an aggregate of not exceeding $5,000 principal amount of  such bonds is also exempt from surtaxes. Interest in excess of the  interest on an aggregate of not exceeding $5,000 principal amount of  such bonds is subject to surtax and must be included in gross income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest credited to postal savings accounts upon moneys  deposited before March 1, 1941, in postal savings banks is wholly exempt  from income tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issued on or after March 1, 1941. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under the provisions of  sections 4 and 5 of the Public Debt Act of 1941 (31 U.S.C. 742a),  interest upon obligations issued on or after March 1, 1941, by the  United States, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, shall not have  any   exemption, as such, from Federal income tax except in respect of any  such obligations which the Federal Maritime Board and Maritime  Administration (formerly United States Maritime Commission) or the  Federal Housing Administration has, before March 1, 1941, contracted to  issue at a future date. The interest on such obligations so contracted  to be issued shall bear such tax-exemption privileges as were at the  time of such contract provided in the law authorizing their issuance.  For the purposes hereof, under section 4(a) of the Public Debt Act of  1941, a Territory and a possession of the United States (or any  political subdivisions thereof), and the District of Columbia, and any  agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, shall not  be considered as an agency or instrumentality of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of obligations issued as the result of a refunding  operation, as, for example, where a corporation exchanges bonds for  previously issued bonds, the refunding obligations are deemed, for the  purposes of this section, to have been issued at the time of the  exchange rather than at the time the original bonds were issued.</p>
