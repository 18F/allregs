                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transit privileges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transit arrangements permit the stopping  of a   carload or truckload shipment at a specific intermediate point en route  to the final destination for storage, processing, or other purposes, as  specified in carrier tariffs or rate tenders. A single through rate is  charged from origin to final destination plus a transit or other related  charge, rather than a more expensive combination of rates to and from  the transit point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer shall consider possible benefits  available to the Government through the use of existing transit  arrangements or through efforts to obtain additional transit privileges  from the carriers. Solicitations incorporating transit arrangements  shall be restricted to f.o.b. origin offers, as f.o.b. destination  offers can only quote fixed overall delivered prices at first  destination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Traffic management personnel shall furnish information and  analyses of situations in which transit arrangements may be beneficial.  The quantity to be awarded must be of sufficient tonnage to ensure that  carload/truckload shipments can be made by the contractor, and there  should be reasonable certainty that shipments out of the transit point  will be requested in carload/truckload quantities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the  provision at 52.247-56, Transit Arrangements, when benefits may accrue  to the Government because transit arrangements may apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transit credits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In evaluations of f.o.b. origin offers for  large quantities of supplies that contractors normally have in process  or storage at intermediate points, contracting officers shall make use  of contractors' earned commercial transit credits, which are recorded  with the carriers. A transit credit represents the transportation costs  for a recorded tonnage from the initial point to an intermediate point.  The remaining transportation charges from the intermediate point to the  Government destination, because they are based on through rates, are  frequently lower than the transportation charges that would apply for  the same tonnage if the intermediate point were the initial origin  point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If transit credits apply, the contract shall state that the  contractor shall ship the goods on prepaid commercial bills of lading,  subject to reimbursement by the Government. The contracting officer  shall ensure that this does not preclude a proper change in delivery  terms under the Changes clause. The shipments move for the account and  at the risk of the Government, as they become Government property at  origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contractor shall show the transportation and transit charges  as separate amounts on the invoice for each individual shipment. The  amount to be reimbursed by the Government shall not exceed the amount  quoted in the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and  contracts the clause at 52.247-57, Transportation Transit Privilege  Credits, when supplies are of such a nature, or when it is the custom of  the trade, that offerors may have potential transit credits available  and the Government may reduce transportation costs through the use of  transit credits.
