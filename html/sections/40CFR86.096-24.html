Engines that are eligible to be included in the same engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if the manufacturer determines that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics.

This paragraph applies to Otto-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)-(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator selects a maximum of two engines within each engine family based upon features indicating that they may have the highest emission levels of the engines in the engine family in accordance with the criteria described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Administrator selects one emission data engine first based on the largest displacement within the engine family. Then from those within the largest displacement the Administrator selects, in the order listed, the engine with the highest fuel flow at the speed of maximum rated torque, with the most advanced spark timing, with no EGR or lowest EGR flow, and with

no air pump or with the lowest actual flow air pump.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Administrator selects one additional engine from within each engine family. The engine selected is the engine expected to exhibit the highest emissions of those engines remaining in the engine family. If all engines within the engine family are similar, the Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the engines selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section do not represent each engine displacement-exhaust emission control system combination, then the Administrator selects one engine of each engine displacement-exhaust emission control system combination not represented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Within an engine family/displacement/control system combination, the manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine including current or previous model year emission data engines and development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Diesel heavy-duty emission data engines. This paragraph applies to diesel-cycle heavy-duty emission data engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Engines will be chosen to be run for emission data based upon engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section must be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Engines of each engine family will be divided into groups based upon their exhaust emission control systems. One engine of each engine system combination must be run for smoke emission data and gaseous emission data. Either the complete gaseous emission test or the complete smoke test may be conducted first. Within each combination, the engine that features the highest fuel feed per stroke, primarily at the speed of maximum rated torque and secondarily at rated speed, will usually be selected. If there are military engines with higher fuel rates than other engines in the same engine system combinations, then one military engine is also selected. The engine with the highest fuel feed per stroke is usually the one selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator may select a maximum of one additional engine within each engine-system combination based upon features indicating that it may have the highest emission levels of the engines of that combination. In selecting this engine, the Administrator will consider such features as the injection system, fuel system, compression ratio, rated speed, rated horsepower, peak torque speed, and peak torque.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Within an engine family control system combination, the manufacturer may alter any emission data engine (or other engine including current or previous model year emission data engines and development engines provided they meet the emission data engines' protocol) to represent more than one selection under paragraphs (b)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Durability data.

Whether engines, subsystems, or components are used, they must be selected so that their emission deterioration characteristics may be expected to represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines utilizing the procedures contained in Sec. 86.094-14 for emission data vehicle selection and determination of deterioration factors. The deterioration factors are applied only to entire engine families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]
