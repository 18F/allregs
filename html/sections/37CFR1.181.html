                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Petition may be taken to the Director:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From any action or requirement of any examiner in the ex parte  prosecution of an application, or in ex parte or inter partes  prosecution of a reexamination proceeding which is not subject to appeal  to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or to the court;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases in which a statute or the rules specify that the matter  is to be determined directly by or reviewed by the Director; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To invoke the supervisory authority of the Director in  appropriate circumstances. For petitions involving action of the Patent  Trial and Appeal Board, see Sec.  41.3 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any such petition must contain a statement of the facts involved  and the point or points to be reviewed and the action requested. Briefs  or memoranda, if any, in support thereof should accompany or be embodied  in the petition; and where facts are to be proven, the proof in the form  of affidavits or declarations (and exhibits, if any) must accompany the  petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a petition is taken from an action or requirement of an  examiner in the ex parte prosecution of an application, or in the ex  parte or inter partes prosecution of a reexamination proceeding, it may  be required that there have been a proper request for reconsideration  (Sec.  1.111) and a repeated action by the examiner. The examiner may be  directed by the Director to furnish a written statement, within a  specified time, setting forth the reasons for his or her decision upon  the matters averred in the petition, supplying a copy to the petitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where a fee is required for a petition to the Director the  appropriate   section of this part will so indicate. If any required fee does not  accompany the petition, the petition will be dismissed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Oral hearing will not be granted except when considered  necessary by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The mere filing of a petition will not stay any period for reply  that may be running against the application, nor act as a stay of other  proceedings. Any petition under this part not filed within two months of  the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested  may be dismissed as untimely, except as otherwise provided. This two- month period is not extendable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Director may delegate to appropriate Patent and Trademark  Office officials the determination of petitions.
