                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to sanction. An adjudicating official or the Board of  Immigration Appeals (the Board) may impose disciplinary sanctions  against any practitioner if it finds it to be in the public interest to  do so. It will be in the public interest to impose disciplinary  sanctions against a practitioner who is authorized to practice before  the Board and the Immigration Courts when such person has engaged in  criminal, unethical, or unprofessional conduct, or in frivolous  behavior, as set forth in Sec. 1003.102. In accordance with the  disciplinary proceedings set forth in this subpart and outlined below,  an adjudicating official or the Board may impose any of the following  disciplinary sanctions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disbarment, which is permanent, from practice before the Board  and the Immigration Courts or the DHS, or before all three authorities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspension, including immediate suspension, from practice before  the Board and the Immigration Courts or the DHS, or before all three  authorities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public or private censure; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such other disciplinary sanctions as the adjudicating official  or the Board deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons subject to sanctions. Persons subject to sanctions  include any practitioner. A practitioner is any attorney as defined in  Sec. 1001.1(f) of this chapter who does not represent the federal  government, or any representative as defined in Sec. 1001.1(j) of this  chapter. Attorneys employed by the Department of Justice shall be  subject to discipline pursuant to Sec. 1003.109. Nothing in this  regulation shall be construed as authorizing persons who do not meet the  definition of practitioner to represent individuals before the Board and  the Immigration Courts or the DHS.
