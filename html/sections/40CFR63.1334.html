                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or operator of a control or recovery device that has one or more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is not required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in Sec.  63.1335(e)(3)(vii) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall operate control and recovery devices such that the daily average of monitored parameters remains above the minimum established level or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise stated in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As specified in Sec.  63.1335(e)(5), all established levels, along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, G, or H of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively on parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuous process vents. During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the required 1-hour runs. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Batch process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be established using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The procedures specified in this paragraph (b)(3) may only be used

if the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to be controlled were tested, and monitoring data were collected, during the entire period in which emissions were vented to the control device, as specified in Sec.  63.1325(c)(1)(i). If the owner or operator chose to test only a portion of the batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled, the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values measured during the required performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the level to be established is a maximum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the lowest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the level to be established is a minimum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the highest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values measured during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be determined as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of Compliance Status, as specified in Sec.  63.1335(e)(5). Said definition shall include an identification of each batch emission episode and the information required to determine parameter monitoring compliance for partial batch cycles (i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished during two different operating days).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams, the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (c), the owner or operator shall supplement the parameter values measured during the performance test with engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is not required by this subpart and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (d), the determination of the parameter monitoring

level shall be based exclusively on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. (1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies continuous monitoring), continuous process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under Sec.  63.1335(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made during the hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) and (B) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to batch process vents, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the given parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(A) through (f)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subtract the time during the periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments from the total amount of time determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain the operating

time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for the operating day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria, this is considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) or (f)(3)(i)(B) of this section is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over the duration of the filling period for the storage vessel, is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during the filling period for the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass emissions per mass product requirements specified in Sec.  63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1)(i), an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as specified in Sec.  63.1318(c) exceeds the appropriate mass emissions per mass product requirement. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> With respect to continuous process vents complying with the temperature limits for final condensers specified in Sec.  63.1316(b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(ii), an excursion has occurred when the daily average exit temperature exceeds the appropriate condenser temperature limit. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart. The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of operation for the condenser for purposes of determining the daily average exit temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> With respect to new affected sources producing SAN using a batch process, an excursion has occurred when the percent reduction calculated using the procedures specified in Sec.  63.1333(c) is less than 84 percent. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart. The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation for purposes of determining the percent reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero

(low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass emissions per mass product requirement specified in Sec.  63.1315(b)(2), an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as specified in Sec.  63.1333(b) exceeds the mass emissions per mass product requirement specified in Sec.  63.1315(b)(2).
