Credits generated under Sec. 80.535(a) and (b) may be used to meet the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of Sec. 80.510(a), and credits generated under 80.535(c) and (d) may be used to meet the NR and NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of 80.510(b) and (c), respectively, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The credits were generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conditions of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Using credits generated under Sec. 80.535. Credits generated under Sec. 80.535 may be used by a refiner or an importer to comply with the diesel fuel standards of Sec. 80.510 (a), (b), and (c) by applying one credit for every gallon of diesel fuel that does not comply with the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credit banking. Credits generated may be banked for use at a later time or may be transferred to any other refiner or importer nationwide for use as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Credit transfers. (1) Credits generated under Sec. 80.535 that are obtained from another refiner or importer may be used to comply with the diesel fuel sulfur standards of Sec. 80.510(a), (b), and (c) if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credits generated under Sec. 80.535 that are obtained from another refiner or importer may be used to comply with the diesel fuel sulfur standards of Sec. 80.510(a), (b), and (c) if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The credits are used in compliance with the time period limitations for credit use in this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any credit transfer is completed no later than August 31 following the compliance period when the credits are used to comply with a standard under paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No credit is transferred more than twice, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer that intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make a second and final transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before it is used or it expires;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The credit transferor applies any credits necessary to meet the transferor's annual compliance requirements before transferring credits to any other refinery or importer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> No credits are transferred that would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Each transferor supplies to the transferee records indicating the year the credits were generated, the identity of the refiner (and refinery) or importer that generated the credits, and the identity of the transferor, if it is not the same party that generated the credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Invalid credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's volume requirements regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the credits were valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The refiner or importer that used the credits, and any transferor of the credits, must adjust its credit records, reports and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the proper credits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any properly created credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies credits as needed to meet the compliance requirements at the end of the calendar year, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor trades or banks the credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> General limitation on credit use. Credits may not be used to achieve compliance with any requirements of this subpart other than the standards of Sec. 80.510(a), (b), and (c), unless specifically approved by the Administrator pursuant to a hardship relief petition under Sec. 80.560 or Sec. 80.561.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of high sulfur NRLM credits.

For example, one credit generated by the production or importation of one gallon of NRLM diesel fuel subject to the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of Sec. 80.510 (a) may be used to produce or import one gallon of NRLM diesel fuel that is exempt from the sulfur standard of Sec. 80.510(a) during the period from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> High sulfur NRLM credits generated under Sec. 80.535(a) or (b) may be used on a one-for-one basis to meet the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of Sec. 80.510(a) from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010.
