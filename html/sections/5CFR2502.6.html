The words ``FOIA REQUEST'' should be clearly marked on both the letter and the envelope. Due to security measures at the Old and New Executive Office Buildings, requests made in person should be delivered to Room G-1, at the above address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any Office employee or official who receives a FOIA Request shall promptly forward it to the FOIA Officer, at the above address. Any Office employee or official who receives an oral request made under the FOIA shall inform the person making the request of the provisions of this subpart requiring a written request according to the procedures set out herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought, including when known: Agency/individual originating the record, date, subject matter, type of document, location, and any other pertinent information which would assist in promptly locating the record(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a request is not considered reasonably descriptive, or requires the production of voluminous records, or places an extraordinary burden on the Office of Administration, seriously interfering with its normal functioning to the detriment of the business of the Government, the Office may require the person or agent making the FOIA request to confer with an Office representative in order to attempt to verify, and, if possible, narrow the scope of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of the FOIA request, the FOIA Officer will make an initial determination of which officials and offices may be involved in the search and reviewing procedures. The FOIA Officer will circulate the request to all offices so identified and any others the FOIA Officer later determines should be notified.
