                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the factor of safety is 1.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A factor of safety of at least five must be used in envelope design. A reduced factor of safety of at least two may be used if it is shown that the selected factor will preclude failure due to creep or instantaneous rupture from

lack of rip stoppers. The selected factor must be applied to the more critical of the maximum operating pressure or envelope stress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A factor of safety of at least five must be used in the design of all fibrous or non-metallic parts of the rigging and related attachments of the envelope to basket, trapeze, or other means provided for carrying occupants. The primary attachments of the envelope to the basket, trapeze, or other means provided for carrying occupants must be designed so that failure is extremely remote or so that any single failure will not jeopardize safety of flight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In applying factors of safety, the effect of temperature, and other operating characteristics, or both, that may affect strength of the balloon must be accounted for.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For design purposes, an occupant weight of at least 170 pounds must be assumed.
