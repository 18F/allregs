A physical meeting space must always exist for association meetings involving director elections and other stockholders' votes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. Each association, and those Farm Credit banks holding annual meetings, must issue an Annual Meeting Information Statement in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 620.20 and 620.21 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Online meeting. Each Farm Credit bank and association using an online meeting space as part of a meeting or election must have policies and procedures in place addressing how the online meeting space will be accessed and used by participants. The policies and procedures must specifically identify any technological adaptations necessary to address the confidentiality and security in voting requirements of Sec. 611.340.</p>
