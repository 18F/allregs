                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Primary tests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  The SCT test is a primary test that may be used in individual captive  cervids and in herds of unknown tuberculous status. Each captive cervid  that responds to the SCT test must be classified as a suspect until it  is retested with the CCT test and is either found negative for  tuberculosis or is classified as a reactor, unless, with exception of a  designated accredited veterinarian, the testing veterinarian determines  that the captive cervid should be classified as a reactor based on its  response to the SCT test. A designated accredited veterinarian must  classify a responding captive cervid as a suspect, unless APHIS  determines, based on epidemiological evidence, that the captive cervid  should be classified as a reactor. A captive cervid that responds to the  SCT test must not be retested using the DPP[supreg] test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The SCT test is a primary test that may be used in affected  herds and in herds that have received captive cervids from an affected  herd. When used with affected herds or in herds that have received a  captive cervid from an affected herd, the SCT test may only be  administered by a veterinarian employed by the State in which the test  is administered or employed by USDA. In affected herds or herds that  have received captive cervids from an affected herd, each captive cervid  that responds to the SCT test must be classified as a reactor, unless  APHIS determines, based on epidemiological evidence, that the cervid  should be classified as a suspect because of possible exposure to a  tuberculous animal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DPP[supreg] test. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The DPP[supreg] test is a primary test  that may be used in individual captive elk, red deer, white-tailed deer,  fallow deer, and reindeer, and in herds of these species that are of  unknown tuberculous status. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)  of this   section, each captive cervid that has non-negative test results to this  initial DPP[supreg] test will be classified as a suspect and retested  with the DPP[supreg] test. A captive cervid that has non-negative test  results to the DPP[supreg] test must not be retested using the SCT or  CCT test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The DPP[supreg] test is a primary test that may be used in  affected herds of captive elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, fallow deer,  and reindeer, and in herds of these species that have received captive  cervids from an affected herd. In such herds, each captive cervid that  has non-negative test results to the DPP[supreg] test will be classified  as a reactor, unless APHIS determines that the captive cervid should be  classified as a suspect because of possible exposure to a tuberculous  animal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supplemental tests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comparative cervical tuberculin (CCT)  test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The CCT test is a supplemental test that may only be used in  order to retest captive cervids that have been classified as suspects  after being tested with the SCT test. The CCT test may be used in  affected herds only after the herd has tested negative to at least two  whole herd SCT tests and only with the prior written consent of APHIS.  The CCT test may not be used as a primary test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A captive cervid tested with the CCT test must be classified as  negative if it has a response to the bovine PPD tuberculin that is less  than 1 mm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unless the testing veterinarian determines that the captive  cervid should be classified as a reactor because of possible exposure to  a tuberculous animal, a captive cervid tested with the CCT test must be  classified as a suspect if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It has a response to the bovine PPD tuberculin that is greater  than 2 mm and that is equal to the response to the avian PPD tuberculin;  or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> It has a response to the bovine PPD tuberculin that is equal to  or greater than 1 mm and equal to or less than 2 mm and that is equal to  or greater than the response to the avian PPD tuberculin.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A captive cervid tested with the CCT test must be classified as  a reactor if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It has a response to the bovine PPD tuberculin that is greater  than 2 mm and that is at least 0.5 mm greater than the response to the  avian PPD tuberculin; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> It has been classified as a suspect on two successive CCT tests.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any exceptions to the reactor classification under the  conditions in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section must be justified by  the testing veterinarian in writing and have the concurrence of APHIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DPP[supreg] test. The DPP[supreg] test may be used as a  supplemental test in order to retest captive cervids that have been  classified as suspects based on an initial DPP[supreg] test. In such  instances, the supplemental DPP[supreg] test must evaluate a new serum  sample drawn from the cervid no sooner than 30 days after the initial  DPP[supreg] test. A captive cervid that has non-negative test results on  two successive DPP[supreg] tests will be classified as a reactor, unless  APHIS determines that another disease classification is warranted.
