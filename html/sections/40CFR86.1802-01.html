                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section numbering. The model year of initial applicability is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is applicable. The section continues to apply to subsequent model years unless a later model year section is adopted. Example: Section 86.18xx-01 applies to the 2001 and subsequent model years. If a Sec. 86.18xx-03 is promulgated it would apply beginning with the 2003 model year; Sec. 86.18xx-01 would apply to model years 2001 through 2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year.</p>
