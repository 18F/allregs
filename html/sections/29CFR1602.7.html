employees shall file with the Commission or its delegate executed copies of Standard Form 100, as revised (otherwise known as ``Employer Information Report EEO-1'') in conformity with the directions set forth in the form and accompanying instructions. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 1602.14, every such employer shall retain at all times at each reporting unit, or at company or divisional headquarters, a copy of the most recent report filed for each such unit and shall make the same available if requested by an officer, agent, or employee of the Commission under the authority of section 710 of title VII. Appropriate copies of Standard Form 100 in blank will be supplied to every employer known to the Commission to be subject to the reporting requirements, but it is the responsibility of all such employers to obtain necessary supplies of the form from the Commission or its delegate prior to the filing date.
