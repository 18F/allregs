Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer or remanufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer or remanufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of locomotives or locomotive engines shall be given to ultimate purchasers, subsequent purchasers (if known), and dealers (as applicable) in such manner and containing such information as required in Subparts E and H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> The certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer shall furnish with each new locomotive or locomotive engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under Sec. 92.211.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer shall furnish with each new locomotive or locomotive engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under Sec. 92.211.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The instruction under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection with such locomotive or locomotive engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer or remanufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer or remanufacturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by independent locomotive or locomotive engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer or remanufacturer has no commercial relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer or remanufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the locomotive or locomotive engine will function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In addition, the manufacturer or remanufacturer shall indicate by

means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the locomotive and to the engine that the locomotive and/or the locomotive engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions as prescribed under Sec. 92.212.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer or remanufacturer bears all cost obligation any dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of this section.

After making such a determination, he shall require the manufacturer to submit a plan to remedy the nonconformity of any such vehicles or engines. The plan shall provide that the manufacturer will remedy, at the manufacturer's expense, all properly maintained and used vehicles which experienced the nonconformity during their useful lives regardless of their age or mileage at the time of repair.

Appendix IV to Part 92--Guidelines for Determining Equivalency</p><p class="depth0">Between Emission Measurement Systems</p><p class="depth0">This appendix describes a series of correlation criteria that EPA considers to be reasonable for the purpose of demonstrating equivalency between two test systems designed to measure the same emissions during FTP locomotive testing. These criteria are presented here only as guidelines. When requested to make a finding of equivalency, EPA could base its decision on criteria other than those listed here, where EPA has reason to believe that these criteria are not appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General approach. (1) Multiple tests should be conducted in pairs on the same locomotive or engine using each of the measurement systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiple tests should be conducted in pairs on the same locomotive or engine using each of the measurement systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Variations for other parameters, such as test fuel, should be minimized to the maximum extent possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Locomotive and/or locomotive engine tests conducted in accordance with the provisions of Subpart B of this part are preferred. Where appropriate, engine tests conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 89 may also be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equivalency of the systems should be determined by comparing individual modal data, individual cycle-weighted data, and the average cycle-weighted results from each system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correlation criteria for particulate measurements. (1) The correlation coefficient (R\2\) for individual modal data should be 0.90, or higher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The correlation coefficient (R\2\) for individual modal data should be 0.90, or higher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum deviation between any pair of cycle-weighted data should be 15 percent, or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ratio of average cycle-weighted results using the alternate system to the average cycle-weighted results using the specified Part 92 system (i.e., avgalt/avgspc) should be between 0.97 and 1.05.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correlation criteria for other measurements. Correlation parameters for gaseous pollutants should be better than those specified in paragraph (b) of this appendix for particulate measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimum number of tests. The recommended minimum number of tests with each system necessary to determine equivalency is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Four locomotive or locomotive engine tests, conducted in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seven 8-mode nonroad engine tests, conducted in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 89.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Statistical outliers. Statistical outliers may be excluded consistent with good engineering judgement. Outliers should be replaced by rerunning each excluded test point. Where more than one outlier is excluded, is recommended to perform one additional pair of tests (in addition to the minimum number specified in paragraph (d) of this appendix) for each two outliers excluded.
