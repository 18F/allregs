                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or managing operator shall make a vessel available for  drydock examinations, internal structural examinations, and underwater  surveys (UWILD) required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If your vessel is operated on international voyages subject to  SOLAS requirements, it must undergo a drydock examination once every 12  months unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey  (UWILD) per Sec. 176.615 of this part. If the vessel becomes due for a  drydock examination or an internal structural examination during the  voyage, it may lawfully complete the voyage prior to the examination if  it undergoes the required examination upon completion of the voyage to  the United States but not later than 30 days after the examination was  due. If the vessel is due for an examination within 15 days of sailing  on an international voyage from the United States port, it must undergo  the required examination before sailing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your vessel is not operated on international voyages and does  not meet the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section, it must  undergo a drydock and internal structural examination as follows unless  it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per Sec.  176.615 of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A vessel that is exposed to salt water more than three months in  any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock  examination and an internal structural at least once every two years;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vessel that is exposed to salt water not more than three  months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a  drydock examination and an internal structural   examination at least once every five years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever damage or deterioration to hull plating or structural  members that may affect the seaworthiness of a vessel is discovered or  suspected, the cognizant OCMI may conduct an internal structural  examination in any affected space including fuel tanks, and may require  the vessel to be drydocked or taken out of service to assess the extent  of the damage, and to effect permanent repairs. The OCMI may also  decrease the drydock examination intervals to monitor the vessel's  structural condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For a vessel that is eligible per Sec. 115.625, and if the  owner opts for an alternate hull examination with the underwater survey  portion conducted exclusively by divers, the vessel must undergo two  alternate hull exams and two internal structural exams within any five- year period. If a vessel completes a satisfactory alternate hull exam,  with the underwater survey portion conducted predominantly by an  approved underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the vessel must  undergo one alternate hull and one internal structural exam, within any  five-year period. The vessel may undergo a drydock exam to satisfy any  of the required alternate hull exams.
