                                Sec. 748.10  Import Certificates and End-User Statements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. There are a variety of Import Certificates and End-User  Statements currently in use by various governments. The control  exercised by the government issuing the Import Certificate or End-User  Statement is in addition to the conditions and restrictions placed on  the transaction by BIS. The laws and regulations of the United States  are in no way modified, changed, or superseded by the issuance of an  Import Certificate or End-User Statement. This section describes  exceptions and relationships for both Import Certificates and End-User  Statements, and generally applies only to transactions exceeding  $50,000. In the case of countries identified in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) of  this part (excluding the People's Republic of China (PRC)), Import  Certificates are required for national security controlled items in  transactions exceeding $50,000. In the case of the PRC, End-User  Statements are required for transactions exceeding $50,000 involving all  items that require a license to the PRC for any reason. However, this  $50,000 threshold is lower for certain exports to the PRC (see paragraph  (b)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Import Certificate or End-User Statement. Unless your  transaction meets one of the exemptions stated in Sec. 748.9(a) of this  part, an Import Certificate or End-User Statement must be obtained, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any commodities on your license application are controlled for  national security (NS) reasons (except for items controlled under ECCNs  5A002 or 5B002), or any commodities to the PRC   on your license application are controlled for any reason;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your license application involves the export of commodities  classified in a single entry on the CCL, and your ultimate consignee is  in any destination listed in Sec. 748.9(b)(2), and the total value of  your transaction exceeds $50,000. Note that the $50,000 transaction  threshold does not apply to certain exports to the PRC. If your  transaction involves an export to the PRC of a computer that requires a  license for any reason, an End-User Statement is required regardless of  dollar value. Also, if your transaction involves an export to the PRC of  an item classified under ECCN 6A003 that requires a license for any  reason, an End-User Statement is required for transactions exceeding  $5000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your license application may list several separate CCL entries.  If any individual entry including an item that is controlled for  national security reasons exceeds $50,000, then an Import Certificate  must be obtained covering all items controlled for national security  reasons on your license application. If the total value of entries on a  license application that require a license to the PRC for any reason  listed on the CCL exceeds $50,000, then a PRC End-User Statement  covering all such controlled items that require a license to the PRC on  your license application must be obtained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If your license application involves a lesser transaction that  is part of a larger order for items controlled for national security  reasons (or, for the PRC, for any reason) in a single ECCN exceeding  $50,000, an Import Certificate, or a PRC End-User Statement, as  appropriate, must be obtained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may be specifically requested by BIS to obtain an Import  Certificate for a transaction valued under $50,000. You also may be  specifically requested by BIS to obtain an End-User Statement for a  transaction valued under $50,000 or for a transaction that requires a  license to the PRC for reasons in the EAR other than those listed in the  CCL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How to obtain an Import Certificate or End-User Statement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Applicants must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or  purchaser) obtain the Import Certificate and that it be issued covering  only those items that are controlled for national security reasons.  Exporters should not request that importers obtain Import Certificates  for items that are controlled for reasons other than national security.  Note that in the case of the PRC, applicants must request that the  importer obtain an End-User Statement for all items on a license  application that require a license to the PRC for any reason listed on  the CCL. Applicants must obtain original Import Certificate or End-User  Statements from importers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant's name must appear on the Import Certificate or  End-User Statement submitted to BIS as either the applicant, supplier,  or order party. The Import Certificate may be made out to either the  ultimate consignee or the purchaser, even though they are different  parties, as long as both are located in the same country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your transaction requires the support of a PRC End-User  Statement, you must ensure that the following information is included on  the PRC End-User Statement signed by an official of the Department of  Mechanic, Electronic and High Technology Industries, Export Control  Division I, of the PRC Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), with MOFCOM's seal  affixed to it:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Title of contract and contract number (optional);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Names of importer and exporter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> End-User and end-use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Description of the item, quantity and dollar value; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Signature of the importer and date.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (c) of this section: You should furnish the  consignee with the item description contained in the CCL to be used in  applying for the Import or End-User Statement. It is also advisable to  furnish a manufacturer's catalog, brochure, or technical specifications  if the item is new.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where to obtain Import and End-User Certificates. See Supplement  No. 4 to this part for a list of the authorities administering the  Import Certificate/   Delivery Verification and End-User Certificate Systems in other  countries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Triangular symbol on International Import Certificates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  accordance with international practice, the issuing government may stamp  a triangular symbol on the International Import Certificate (IIC). This  symbol is notification that the importer does not intend to import or  retain the items in the country issuing the certificate, but that, in  any case, the items will not be delivered to any destination except in  accordance with the export regulations of the issuing country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you receive an IIC bearing a triangular symbol, you must  identify all parties to the transaction on the license application,  including those located outside the country issuing the IIC. If the  importer declines to provide you with this information, you may advise  the importer to provide the information directly to BIS, through a U.S.  Foreign Commercial Service office, or in a sealed envelope to you marked  ``To be opened by BIS only''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiple license applications supported by one certificate. An  Import or End-User Certificate may cover more than one purchase order  and more than one item. Where the certificate includes items for which  more than one license application will be submitted, you must include in  Block 24 on your application, or in an attachment to each license  application submitted against the certificate, the following  certification:</p><p class="depth2">I (We) certify that the quantities of items shown on this license  application, based on the Certificate identified in Block 13 of this  license application, when added to the quantities shown on all other  license applications submitted to BIS based on the same Certificate, do  not total more than the total quantities shown on the above cited  Certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Submission of Import Certificates and End-User Statements.  Certificates and Statements must be retained on file by the applicant in  accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR, and  should not be submitted with the license application. For more  information on what Import Certificate and End-User Statement  information must be included in license applications, refer to Sec.  748.9(c) of the EAR. In addition, as set forth in Sec. 748.12(e), to  assist in license reviews, BIS will require applicants, on a random  basis, to submit specific original Import Certificate and End-User  Statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Alterations. After an Import or End-User Certificate is issued  by a foreign government, no corrections, additions, or alterations may  be made on the Certificate by any person. If you desire to explain any  information contained on the Certificate, you may attach a signed  statement to the Certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Request for Delivery Verification. BIS will, on a selective  basis, require Delivery Verification documents for shipments supported  by Import Certificates. You will be notified if Delivery Verification is  required at the time of issuance of the license. Please refer to Sec.  748.13 of this part for detailed information on these procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Retention procedures. You must retain on file the original copy  of any certificate issued in support of a license application submitted  to BIS, unless the original is submitted with the license application.  All recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR apply to  this requirement, except that reproductions may not be substituted for  the officially authenticated original in this instance.
