                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An invitation for bids for supplies, equipment, and services  must be serially numbered at the time of issue. Numbers assigned locally  must consist of the facility or VA National Acquisition Center division  number, the serial number of the invitation, and the fiscal year in  which the VA facility issues the invitation, e.g., 533-24-07 for the  24th invitation issued by VA facility   533 in Fiscal Year 2007. A series beginning with the number 1 must be  started each fiscal year. Numbers assigned from a national register may  be sequential, without regard to year, and use whatever numbering system  assigned by the national system or VA's Electronic Contract Management  System (eCMS). VHA shall use eCMS for all solicitation numbering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An invitation for bid for supplies, equipment, and services that  is numbered locally must be numbered in the series of the year in which  it is issued, will be accepted, and will become a contract in the same  fiscal year but, because of procurement lead time, will not be performed  until the next fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An invitation for bid that is numbered locally must be numbered  in the next fiscal year series if it is issued in one fiscal year but  the contract will become effective and will be performed only in the  next fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An invitation for a construction contract must bear the  applicable invitation for bid number and the project number, if  assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An invitation for bid containing a summary bid request must  include the following statement:</p><p class="depth2">``The award will be made on either an individual item basis or  summary bid basis, whichever results in the lowest cost to the  Government. Therefore, to assure proper evaluation of all bids, a bidder  quoting a summary bid price must also quote a price on each individual  item included in the summary bid price.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a contracting officer determines that it will be to the  Government's advantage to make an award by group or groups of items, the  contracting officer must include a provision for the award by group or  groups of items in the invitation for bids. This may apply when the  items in the group or groups are readily available from sources to be  solicited; and one of the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is desirable to award a minimum number of contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Furniture or fixtures are required for a single project and  uniformity of design is desirable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The articles required will be assembled and used as a unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A solicitation for a construction contract must contain a  statement on the order of priority in which VA will award any  alternative bid items, based on the relative importance of the items,  VA's cost estimate, and the amount of funds available, when the  following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA intends to make a single aggregate award for all items in the  solicitation within certain fiscal limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The solicitation asks for prices on an item and alternate item  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A bid item schedule in a solicitation issued in compliance with  paragraph (e) of this section should be structured substantially as  follows:</p><p class="depth2">A single award will be made on Item No. 1, but in the event the  offer exceeds the funds available, a single award will be made on Item  No. 2 or Item No. 3, in that order, based on available funding. Offerors  should quote a price on each item listed.</p><p class="depth2">Item No. 1--Furnish all labor, material, equipment, etc., to paint  Buildings No. 1, 2, and 3: $----.</p><p class="depth2">Alternate items in order of priority:</p><p class="depth2">Item No. 2--Furnish all labor, material, equipment, etc., to paint  Building Nos. 1 and 2: $----.</p><p class="depth2">Item No. 3--Furnish all labor, material, equipment, etc., to paint  Building No. 1: ----.</p>
