                            <p class="depth0">The authority to issue bills of lading previously contained in this  section is rescinded. Except for individual small package shipments  (e.g., United Parcel Service, Federal Express, or United States Postal  Service small package shipments), no VA employee may issue a bill of  lading or otherwise procure transportation services for goods unless the  employee has been delegated authority to do so as a warranted  contracting officer under the VA Contracting Officer Certification  Program (ref. 801.690). All transportation services for goods, other  than for small package shipments, require a bill of lading. Except for  individual small package shipments, individuals with only micro-purchase  authority may not issue bills of lading or otherwise procure  transportation services. The dollar value of the bill of lading issued  or transportation services acquired must not exceed the delegated  authority of the contracting officer. Candidates for appointment as  transportation contracting officers whose delegated authority will be  limited to the acquisition of transportation services for goods only  shall comply with the Education, Experience, and Training requirements,  if any, in Part 102-117 of title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, the  Federal Management Regulation, rather than the requirements in 801.690.</p>
