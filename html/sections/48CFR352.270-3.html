                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 370.202(b), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Indian Preference Program (January 2006)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract entitled ``Indian Preference,'' the Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive preference for employment and training in connection with the work to be performed under this contract, and which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts. In this connection, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designate a liaison officer who will maintain liaison with the Government and the Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and administer the Contractor's Indian preference program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants will be given preference in employment and training incident to such employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not more than 20 calendar days after award of the contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed that sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate numbers and types of employees needed; the approximate dates of employment; the experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training opportunities available; and other pertinent information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work is to be performed to provide assistance to the Contractor in filling its employment needs and training opportunities. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact in regard to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. The Contractor shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities and, to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, shall solicit bids or proposals only from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to the request for assistance and information. Public notices and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by including--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A clear description of the supplies or services required, including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which facilitate the participation of Indian firms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement indicating that preference will be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in accordance with section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 [88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)];</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions for the terms ``Indian organization'' and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' as prescribed under the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting bids or proposals from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, no responsive bid or acceptable proposal is received, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract. If one or more responsible bids or acceptable proposals are received, award shall be made to the low responsible bidder or acceptable offeror if the price is determined to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid or acceptable proposal is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Maintain written records under this contract which indicate--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The numbers of Indians seeking employment for each employment position available under this contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number and types of positions filled by Indians and non-Indians;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of Indians employed under this contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For those positions where there are both Indian and non-Indian applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) why the Indian applicant was not selected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Actions taken to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under this contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms as subcontractors or suppliers for each requirement where it was determined by the Contractor that such preference would not be consistent with the efficient performance of the contract; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The number of Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises contacted, and the number receiving subcontract awards under this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a quarterly report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and indicates the number and types of available positions filled by Indians and non-Indians, and the dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and to all other firms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Maintain records pursuant to this clause and keep them available for review by the Government for one year after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms ``Indian,'' ``Indian Tribe,'' ``Indian Organization,'' and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' are defined in the clause of this contract entitled ``Indian Preference.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Indian reservation'' includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian Allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``On or near an Indian Reservation'' means on a reservation or reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement dealing with the award and administration of contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract awarded at any tier under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such subcontracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may impose any other sanctions authorized by law or by other provisions of the contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
