Board review will, however, be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A showing that a rate violates section 10726 will not create a presumption that the higher rate is unreasonably high, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A finding by the Board that a rate or charge violates the provisions of section 10726 will not, absent a specific showing of damages, afford a basis for an award of reparations.
