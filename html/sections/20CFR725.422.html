Such  assistance may be made available to a claimant in the discretion of the  Solicitor of Labor or his or her designee at any time prior to or during  the time in which the claim is being adjudicated and shall be furnished  without charge to the claimant. Representation of a claimant in  adjudicatory proceedings shall not be provided by the Department of  Labor unless it is determined by the Solicitor of Labor that such  representation is in the best interests of the black lung benefits  program. In no event shall representation be provided to a claimant in a  claim with respect to which the claimant's interests are adverse to  those of the Secretary of Labor or the fund.</p>
