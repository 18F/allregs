                                Sec. 2506.15  What will the notice tell me regarding collection 
the notice, or arrangements to pay the debt are not made within 60 days of the notice?

                            <p class="depth0">The notice provided under Sec. 2506.14 will advise you that, within 60 days of the date of the notice, your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) must be paid or you must enter into a voluntary repayment agreement. If you do not pay the debt or enter into the agreement within that deadline, the Corporation may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By transferring the debt to the Treasury for collection, including under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury (see Sec. 2506.10);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By referral to a credit reporting agency (see Sec. 2506.12), private collection contractor (see Sec. 2506.13), or the DOJ (see Sec. 2506.11);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are a Corporation employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full (see subpart C of this part). The Corporation will specify the

amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the deduction. 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 govern such proceedings;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than the Corporation, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency (see subpart C of this part). 5 U.S.C. 5514 governs such proceedings;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax (see subpart D of this part);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> By administrative offset (see subpart E of this part);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> By administrative wage garnishment (see subpart F of this part); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> By liquidation of security or collateral. The Corporation has the right to hold security or collateral, liquidate it, and apply the proceeds to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a foreclosure. The Corporation will not follow the procedures in this paragraph (h) if the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate to its value.</p>
