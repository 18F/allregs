However, when projects are transferred to Account 101, Electric Plant in Service, a new depreciation rate based upon the remaining service life and undepreciated amounts, will be established.</p><p class="depth0">D. Records shall be maintained with respect to each unit of experiment so that full details may be obtained as to the cost, depreciation, and the experimental status.</p><p class="depth0">E. Should it be determined that experimental plant recorded in this account will fail to satisfactorily perform its function, the costs thereof shall be accounted for as directed or authorized by RUS.</p><p class="depth0">104 Electric Plant Leased to Others</p><p class="depth0">A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant owned by the utility, but leased to others as operating units or systems, where the lessee has exclusive possession.</p><p class="depth0">B. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for electric plant in service and this account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were used by the owner in its utility operations.</p><p class="depth0">105 Electric Plant Held for Future Use</p><p class="depth0">A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant (except land and land rights) owned and held for future use in electric service under a definite plan for such use, to include: (1) Property acquired (except land and land rights) but never used by the utility in electric service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in service but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in electric service.</p><p class="depth0">B.

(See Sec.  1767.16 (g).)</p><p class="depth0">C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the borrower shall notify RUS of such condition and request approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account.</p><p class="depth0">D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in Accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be

significant by RUS. Upon such a determination, the amounts shall be transferred to Account 256, Deferred Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or Account 187, Deferred Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, and amortized to Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">E.

Any expenditures which are identified exclusively with units of property not yet in service shall be included in this account.</p><p class="depth0">C. Expenditures on research, development, and demonstration projects for construction of utility facilities are to be included in a separate subdivision in this account. Records must be maintained to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.</p><p class="depth0">D.

Include, also, the balance of accumulated provision for depreciation on property when transferred to Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, from other property accounts. Normally, Account 108 will not be used for current depreciation provision because, as provided herein, the service life during which depreciation is computed commences with the date property is includible in electric plant in service; however, if special circumstances indicate the propriety of current accruals for depreciation, such charges shall be made to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.</p><p class="depth0">3. Amounts charged to Account 413, Expenses of Electric Plant Leased to Others, for electric plant included in Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others.</p><p class="depth0">4.

At the time of retirement of depreciable electric utility plant, this account shall be charged with the book cost of the property retired and the cost of removal and shall be credited with the salvage value and any other amounts recovered, such as insurance.

When retirement, costs of removal and salvage are entered originally in retirement work orders, the net total of such work orders may be included in a separate subaccount hereunder. Upon completion of the work order, the proper distribution to subdivisions of this account shall be made as provided in the following paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">C. Account 108 shall be subaccounted as follows:

When any property to which this account applies is sold, relinquished, or otherwise retired from service, this account shall be charged with the amount previously credited in respect to such property. The book cost of the property so retired less the amount chargeable to this account and less the net proceeds realized at retirement shall be included in Account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or Account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">C. For general ledger and balance sheet purposes, this account shall be regarded and treated as a single composite provision for amortization. For purposes of analysis, however, each utility shall maintain subsidiary records in which this account is segregated according to the following functional classification for electric plant: (1) Steam production, (2) Nuclear production, (3) Hydraulic production, (4) Other production, (5) Transmission, (6) Distribution, and (7) General. These subsidiary records shall reflect the current credits and debits to this account in sufficient detail to show separately for each such functional classification: (1) the amount of accrual for amortization, (2) the book cost of property retired, (3) cost of removal, (4) salvage, and (5) other items, including recoveries from insurance.</p><p class="depth0">D.

With respect to acquisitions after the effective date of this system of accounts, this account shall be subdivided so as to show the amounts included herein for each property acquisition and to electric plant in service, electric plant held for future use, and electric plant leased to others. (See Sec.  1767.16 (e).)</p><p class="depth0">C. Debit amounts recorded in this account related to plant and land acquisition may be amortized to Account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, over a period not longer than the estimated remaining life of the properties to which such amounts relate. Amounts related to the acquisition of land only may be amortized to Account 425 over a period of not more than 15 years. Should a utility wish to account for debit amounts in this account in any other manner, it shall petition RUS for authority to do so. Credit amounts recorded in this account shall be accounted for as directed by RUS.
