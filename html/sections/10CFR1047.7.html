A protective force officer is authorized to use deadly force only when one or more of the following circumstances exists:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Self-Defense. When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to protect a protective force officer who reasonably believes himself or herself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Serious offenses against persons. When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offense against a person(s) in circumstances presenting an imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm (e.g. sabotage of an occupied facility by explosives).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices. When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the theft, sabotage, or unauthorized control of a nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special nuclear material. When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the theft, sabotage, or unauthorized control of special nuclear material from an area of a fixed site or from a shipment where Category II or greater quantities are known or reasonably believed to be present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Apprehension. When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to apprehend or prevent the escape of a person reasonably believed to: (i) have committed an offense of the nature specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) \1\ of this section; or (ii) be escaping by use of a weapon or explosive or who otherwise indicates that he or she poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the protective force officer or others unless apprehended without delay.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ These offenses are considered by the Department of Energy to pose a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional Considerations Involving Firearms. If it becomes necessary to use a firearm, the following precautions shall be observed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A warning, e.g. an order to halt, shall be given, if feasible, before a shot is fired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Warning shots shall not be fired.</p>
