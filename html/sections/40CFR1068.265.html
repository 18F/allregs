                            <p class="depth0">In some cases, exempted engines may need to meet alternate emission standards as a condition of the exemption. For example, replacement engines exempted under Sec.  1068.240 in many cases need to meet the same standards as the engines they are replacing. The standard-setting part may similarly exempt engines/equipment from all certification requirements, or allow us to exempt engines/equipment from all certification requirements for certain cases, but require the engines/equipment to meet alternate standards. In these cases, all the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your engines/equipment must meet the alternate standards we specify in (or pursuant to) the exemption section, and all other requirements applicable to engines/equipment that are subject to such standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You need not apply for and receive a certificate for the exempt engines/equipment. However, you must comply with all the requirements and obligations that would apply to the engines/equipment if you had received a certificate of conformity for them unless we specifically waive certain requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must have emission data from test engines/equipment using the appropriate procedures that demonstrate compliance with the alternate standards unless the engines/equipment are identical in all material respects to engines/equipment that you have previously certified to standards that are

the same as, or more stringent than, the alternate standards. Note that ``engines/equipment that you have previously certified'' does not include any engines/equipment initially covered by a certificate that was later voided or otherwise invalidated, or engines/equipment that we have determined did not fully conform to the regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> See the provisions of the applicable exemption for labeling instructions, including those related to the compliance statement and other modifications to the label otherwise required in the standard-setting part. If we do not identify specific labeling requirements for an exempted engine, you must meet the labeling requirements in the standard-setting part, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Modify the family designation by eliminating the character that identifies the model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We may also specify alternative language to replace the compliance statement otherwise required in the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not generate emission credits for averaging, banking, or trading with engines/equipment meeting requirements under the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Keep records to show that you meet the alternate standards as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If your exempted engines/equipment are identical to previously certified engines/equipment, keep your most recent application for certification for the certified family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you previously certified a similar family, but have modified the exempted engines/equipment in a way that changes them from their previously certified configuration, keep your most recent application for certification for the certified family, a description of the relevant changes, and any test data or engineering evaluations that support your conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you have not previously certified a similar family, keep all the records we specify for the application for certification and any additional records the standard-setting part requires you to keep.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We may require you to send us an annual report of the engines/equipment you produce under this section.</p>
