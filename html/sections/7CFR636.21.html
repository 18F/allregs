                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation activities funded through WHIP, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a WHIP cost-share agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest on any such credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that program purposes are met and the requirements for WHIP funded improvements are met and maintained consistent with Sec. Sec. 636.8 and 636.9. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a WHIP cost-share agreement, participants are highly encouraged to request a compatibility assessment from NRCS prior to entering into such agreements. The WHIP cost-share agreement may be modified, in accordance with policies outlined in Sec. 636.10, provided the modification meets WHIP purposes and is in compliance with this part.</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER E [RESERVED]</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER F_SUPPORT ACTIVITIES</p>
