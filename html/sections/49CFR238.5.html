An actuator typically consists of a cylinder, piston, and piston  rod.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Railroad  Administration or the Administrator's delegate.</p><p class="depth0">Alerter means a device or system installed in the locomotive cab to  promote continuous, active locomotive engineer attentiveness by  monitoring select locomotive engineer-induced control activities. If  fluctuation of a monitored locomotive engineer-induced control activity  is not detected within a predetermined time, a sequence of audible and  visual alarms is activated so as to progressively prompt a response by  the locomotive engineer. Failure by the locomotive engineer to institute  a change of state in a monitored control, or acknowledge the alerter  alarm activity through a manual reset provision, results in a penalty  brake application that brings the locomotive or train to a stop.</p><p class="depth0">Anti-climbing mechanism means the parts at the ends of adjoining  vehicles in a train that are designed to engage when subjected to large  buff loads to prevent the override of one vehicle by another.</p><p class="depth0">Bind means restrict the intended movement of one or more brake  system components by obstruction, increased friction, or reduced  clearance.</p><p class="depth0">Block of cars means one car or multiple cars in a solid unit coupled  together for the purpose of being added to, or removed from, a train as  a solid unit.</p><p class="depth0">Brake, air or power brake means a combination of devices operated by  compressed air, arranged in a system, and controlled manually,  electrically, or pneumatically, by means of which the motion of a rail  car or locomotive is retarded or arrested.</p><p class="depth0">Brake, disc means a retardation system used on some rail vehicles,  primarily passenger equipment, that utilizes flat metal discs as the  braking surface instead of the wheel tread.</p><p class="depth0">Brake, dynamic means a train braking system whereby the kinetic  energy of a moving train is used to generate electric current at the  locomotive traction motors, which is then dissipated through banks of  resistor grids or back into the catenary or third rail system.</p><p class="depth0">Brake, effective means a brake that is capable of producing its  required designed retarding force on the train. A brake is not effective  if its piston travel is in excess of the maximum prescribed limits.

This may  be accomplished by designing energy-absorbing structures of low strength  in the unoccupied volumes of a rail vehicle or passenger train to  collapse in a controlled manner, while providing higher structural  strength in the occupied volumes. Energy deflection can also be part of  a crash energy management approach. Crash energy management can be used  to help provide anti-climbing resistance and to reduce the risk of train  buckling during a collision.</p><p class="depth0">Crash refuge means a volume with structural strength designed to  maximize the survivability of crewmembers stationed in the locomotive  cab during a collision.</p><p class="depth0">Crewmember means a railroad employee called to perform service  covered by the Federal hours of service laws at 49 U.S.C. 21103 and  subject to the railroad's operating rules and program of operational  tests and inspections required in Sec. 217.9 and Sec. 217.11 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Critical buckling stress means the minimum stress necessary to  initiate buckling of a structural member.</p><p class="depth0">Dual-function window means a window that is intended to serve as  both an emergency window exit and a rescue access window and that meets  the applicable requirements set forth in both Secs. 238.113 and 238.114.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency brake application means an irretrievable brake application  resulting in the maximum retarding force available from the train brake  system.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency responder means a member of a police or fire department,  or other organization involved with public safety charged with providing  or coordinating emergency services, who responds to a passenger train  emergency.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency window means the segment of a side-facing glazing panel  that has been designed to permit rapid and easy removal from inside a  passenger car in an emergency situation.</p><p class="depth0">End-frame door means an end-facing door normally located between, or  adjacent to, the collision posts or similar end-frame structural  elements.</p><p class="depth0">End structure means the main support structure projecting upward  from the underframe of a locomotive, passenger car, or other rail  vehicle.
