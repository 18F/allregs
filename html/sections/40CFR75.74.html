                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Annual monitoring requirement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of an  affected unit subject both to an Acid Rain emission limitation and to a  State or federal NOX mass reduction program that adopts the  provisions of this part must meet the requirements of this part during  the entire calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of an affected unit subject to a State or  federal NOX mass reduction program that adopts the provisions  of this part and that requires monitoring and reporting of hourly  emissions on an annual basis must meet the requirements of this part  during the entire calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ozone season monitoring requirements. The owner or operator of  an affected unit that is not required to meet the requirements of this  subpart on an annual basis under paragraph (a) of this section may  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Meet the requirements of this subpart on an annual basis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Meet the requirements of this subpart during the ozone season,  except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the owner or operator of an affected unit chooses to meet the  requirements of this subpart on less than an annual basis in accordance  with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of a unit that uses continuous emissions  monitoring systems or a fuel flowmeter to meet any of the requirements  of this subpart shall quality assure the hourly ozone season emission  data required by this subpart. To achieve this, the owner or operator  shall operate, maintain and calibrate each required CEMS and shall  perform diagnostic testing and quality assurance testing of each  required CEMS or fuel flowmeter according to the applicable provisions  of paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section. Except where  otherwise noted, the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this  section apply instead of the quality assurance provisions in sections  2.1 through 2.3 of appendix B to this part, and shall be used in lieu of  those appendix B provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Quality assurance requirements prior to the ozone season. The  provisions of this paragraph apply to each ozone   season. The owner or operator shall, at a minimum, perform the following  diagnostic testing and quality assurance assessments, and shall maintain  the following records, to ensure that the hourly emission data recorded  at the beginning of the current ozone season are suitable for reporting  as quality-assured data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each required gas monitor (i.e., for each NOX  pollutant concentration monitor and each diluent gas (CO2 or  O2) monitor, including CO2 and O2  monitors used exclusively for heat input determination and O2  monitors used for moisture determination), a linearity check shall be  performed and passed in the second calendar quarter no later than April  30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Conduct each linearity check in accordance with the general  procedures in section 6.2 of appendix A to this part, except that the  data validation procedures in sections 6.2(a) through (f) of appendix A  do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each linearity check shall be done ``hands-off,'' as described  in section 2.2.3(c) of appendix B to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the time period extending from the date and hour in which the  linearity check is passed through April 30, the owner or operator shall  operate and maintain the CEMS and shall perform daily calibration error  tests of the CEMS in accordance with section 2.1 of appendix B to this  part. When a calibration error test is failed, as described in section  2.1.4 of appendix B to this part, corrective actions shall be taken. The  additional calibration error test provisions of section 2.1.3 of  appendix B to this part shall be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the linearity check is not completed by April 30, data  validation shall be determined in accordance with paragraph  (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each required CEMS (i.e., for each NOX  concentration monitoring system, each NOX-diluent monitoring  system, each flow rate monitoring system, each moisture monitoring  system and each diluent gas CEMS used exclusively for heat input  determination), a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) shall be performed  and passed in the first or second calendar quarter, but no later than  April 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Conduct each RATA in accordance with the applicable procedures  in sections 6.5 through 6.5.10 of appendix A to this part, except that  the data validation procedures in sections 6.5(f)(1) through (f)(6) do  not apply, and, for flow rate monitoring systems, the required RATA load  level(s) (or operating level(s)) shall be as specified in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each RATA shall be done ``hands-off,'' as described in section  2.3.2 (c) of appendix B to this part. The provisions in section 2.3.1.4  of appendix B to this part, pertaining to the number of allowable RATA  attempts, shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For flow rate monitoring systems installed on peaking units or  bypass stacks and for flow monitors exempted from multiple-level RATA  testing under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part, a single-load  (or single-level) RATA is required. For all other flow rate monitoring  systems, a 2-load (or 2-level) RATA is required at the two most  frequently-used load or operating levels (as defined under section  6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part), with the following exceptions.  Except for flow monitors exempted from 3-level RATA testing under  section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part, a 3-load flow RATA is  required at least once every five years and is also required if the flow  monitor polynomial coefficients or K factor(s) are changed prior to  conducting the flow RATA required under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A bias test of each required NOX concentration  monitoring system, each NOX-diluent monitoring system and  each flow rate monitoring system shall be performed in accordance with  section 7.6 of appendix A to this part. If the bias test is failed, a  bias adjustment factor (BAF) shall be calculated for the monitoring  system, as described in section 7.6.5 of appendix A to this part and  shall be applied to the subsequent data recorded by the CEMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the time period extending from the hour of completion of the  required RATA through April 30, the owner or operator shall operate and  maintain the CEMS by performing, at a minimum, the following activities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall perform daily calibration error  tests and (if applicable) daily flow monitor interference checks,  according to section 2.1 of appendix B to this part. When a   daily calibration error test or interference check is failed, as  described in section 2.1.4 of appendix B to this part, corrective  actions shall be taken. The additional calibration error test provisions  in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part shall be followed. Records  of the required daily calibration error tests and interference checks  shall be kept in a format suitable for inspection on a year-round basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or  change in a certified monitoring system that significantly affects the  ability of the system to accurately measure or record NOX  mass emissions or heat input or to meet the requirements of Sec. 75.21  or appendix B to this part, the owner or operator shall recertify the  monitoring system according to Sec. 75.20(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Data validation. For each RATA that is performed by April 30,  data validation shall be done according to sections 2.3.2(a)-(j) of  appendix B to this part. However, if a required RATA is not completed by  April 30, data from the monitoring system shall be invalid, beginning  with the first unit operating hour on or after May 1. The owner or  operator shall continue to invalidate all data from the CEMS until  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The required RATA of the CEMS has been performed and passed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A probationary calibration error test of the CEMS is passed in  accordance with Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ii). Once the probationary calibration  error test has been passed, the owner or operator shall perform the  required RATA in accordance with the conditional data validation  provisions and within the 720 unit or stack operating hour time frame  specified in Sec. 75.20(b)(3) (subject to the restrictions in paragraph  (c)(3)(xii) of this section), and the term ``quality assurance'' shall  apply instead of the term ``recertification.'' However, in lieu of the  provisions in Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ix), the owner or operator shall follow  the applicable provisions in paragraphs (c)(3)(xi) and (c)(3)(xii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Quality assurance requirements within the ozone season. The  provisions of this paragraph apply to each ozone season. The owner or  operator shall, at a minimum, perform the following quality assurance  testing during the ozone season, i.e. in the time period extending from  May 1 through September 30 of each calendar year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Daily calibration error tests and (if applicable) interference  checks of each CEMS required by this subpart shall be performed in  accordance with sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of appendix B to this part. The  applicable provisions in sections 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of appendix B  to this part, pertaining, respectively, to additional calibration error  tests and calibration adjustments, data validation, and quality  assurance of data with respect to daily assessments, shall also apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each gas monitor required by this subpart, linearity checks  shall be performed in the second and third calendar quarters, as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the second calendar quarter, the pre-ozone season linearity  check required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be  performed by April 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the third calendar quarter, a linearity check shall be  performed and passed no later than July 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Conduct each linearity check in accordance with the general  procedures in section 6.2 of appendix A to this part, except that the  data validation procedures in sections 6.2(a) through (f) of appendix A  do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Each linearity check shall be done ``hands-off,'' as described  in section 2.2.3(c) of appendix B to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Data Validation. For second and third quarter linearity checks  performed by the applicable deadline (i.e., April 30 or July 30), data  validation shall be done in accordance with sections 2.2.3(a), (b), (c),  (e), and (h) of Appendix B to this part. However, if a required  linearity check for the second calendar quarter is not completed by  April 30, or if a required linearity check for the third calendar  quarter is not completed by July 30, data from the monitoring system (or  range) shall be invalid, beginning with the first unit operating hour on  or after May 1 or July 31, respectively. The owner or operator shall  continue to invalidate all data from the CEMS until either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The required linearity check of the CEMS has been performed and  passed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A probationary calibration error test of the CEMS is passed in  accordance with Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ii). Once the probationary calibration  error test has been passed, the owner or operator shall perform the  required linearity check in accordance with the conditional data  validation provisions and within the 168 unit or stack operating hour  time frame specified in Sec. 75.20(b)(3) (subject to the restrictions in  paragraph (c)(3)(xii) of this section), and the term ``quality  assurance'' shall apply instead of the term ``recertification.''  However, in lieu of the provisions in Sec. 75.20(b)(3)(ix), the owner or  operator shall follow the applicable provisions in paragraphs (c)(3)(xi)  and (c)(3)(xii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A pre-season linearity check performed and passed in April  satisfies the linearity check requirement for the second quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The third quarter linearity check requirement in paragraph  (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is waived if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Due to infrequent unit operation, the 168 operating hour  conditional data validation period associated with a pre-season  linearity check extends into the third quarter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A linearity check is performed and passed within that  conditional data validation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each flow monitoring system required by this subpart,  except for flow monitors installed on non-load-based units that do not  produce electrical or thermal output, flow-to-load ratio tests are  required in the second and third calendar quarters, in accordance with  section 2.2.5 of appendix B to this part. If the flow-to-load ratio test  for the second calendar quarter is failed, the owner or operator shall  follow the procedures in section 2.2.5(c)(8) of appendix B to this part.  If the flow-to-load ratio test for the third calendar quarter is failed,  data from the flow monitor shall be considered invalid at the beginning  of the next ozone season unless, prior to May 1 of the next calendar  year, the owner or operator has either successfully implemented Option 1  in section 2.2.5.1 of appendix B to this part or Option 2 in section  2.2.5.2 of appendix B to this part, or unless a flow RATA has been  performed and passed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each differential pressure-type flow monitor used to meet  the requirements of this subpart, quarterly leak checks are required in  the second and third calendar quarters, in accordance with section 2.2.2  of appendix B to this part. For the second calendar quarter of the year,  only the unit or stack operating hours in the months of May and June  shall be used to determine whether the second calendar quarter is a QA  operating quarter (as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter). Data  validation for quarterly flow monitor leak checks shall be done in  accordance with section 2.2.3(g) of appendix B to this part. If the leak  check for the third calendar quarter is failed and a subsequent leak  check is not passed by the end of the ozone season, then data from the  flow monitor shall be considered invalid at the beginning of the next  ozone season unless a leak check is passed prior to May 1 of the next  calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A fuel flow-to-load ratio test in section 2.1.7 of appendix D to  this part shall be performed in the second and third calendar quarters  if, for a unit using a fuel flowmeter to determine heat input under this  subpart, the owner or operator has elected to use the fuel flow-to-load  ratio test to extend the deadline for the next fuel flowmeter accuracy  test. Automatic deadline extensions may be claimed for the two calendar  quarters outside the ozone season (the first and fourth calendar  quarters), since a fuel flow-to-load ratio test is not required in those  quarters. If a fuel flow-to-load ratio test is failed, follow the  applicable procedures and data validation provisions in section 2.1.7.4  of appendix D to this part. If the fuel flow-to-load ratio test for the  third calendar quarter is failed, data from the fuel flowmeter shall be  considered invalid at the beginning of the next ozone season unless the  requirements of section 2.1.7.4 of appendix D to this part have been  fully met prior to May 1 of the next calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)-(viii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> If, for any required CEMS, diagnostic linearity checks or RATAs  other than those required by this section are   performed during the ozone season, use the applicable data validation  procedures in section 2.2.3 (for linearity checks) or 2.3.2 (for RATAs)  of appendix B to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If any required CEMS is recertified within the ozone season, use  the data validation provisions in Sec. 75.20(b)(3) and, if applicable,  paragraphs (c)(3)(xi) and (c)(3)(xii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> If, at the end of the second quarter of any calendar year, a  required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test of a  monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the  quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s)  to be completed in a subsequent quarter, the owner or operator shall  indicate this by means of a suitable conditionally valid data flag in  the electronic quarterly report for the second calendar quarter. The  owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter if  the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is  subsequently failed. In the resubmitted report, the owner or operator  shall use the appropriate missing data routine in Sec. Sec. 75.31  through Sec. 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of  conditionally valid data that was invalidated by the failed quality  assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test. Alternatively, if any  required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is not  completed by the end of the second calendar quarter but is completed no  later than 30 days after the end of that quarter (i.e., prior to the  deadline for submitting the quarterly report under Sec. 75.73), the test  data and results may be submitted with the second quarter report even  though the test date(s) are from the third calendar quarter. In such  instances, if the quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification  test(s) are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation  provisions of Sec. 75.20(b)(3), conditionally valid data may be reported  as quality-assured, in lieu of reporting a conditional data flag. If the  tests are failed and if conditionally valid data are replaced, as  appropriate, with substitute data, then neither the reporting of a  conditional data flag nor resubmission is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> If, at the end of the third quarter of any calendar year, a  required quality assurance, diagnostic or recertification test of a  monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the  quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s)  to be completed, the owner or operator shall do one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the results of the required tests are not available within 30  days of the end of the third calendar quarter and cannot be submitted  with the quarterly report for the third calendar quarter, then the test  results are considered to be missing and the owner or operator shall use  the appropriate missing data routine in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through  Sec. 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally  valid data in the third quarter report. In addition, if the data in the  second quarterly report were flagged as conditionally valid at the end  of the quarter, pending the results of the same missing tests, the owner  or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter and shall  use the appropriate missing data routine in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through  Sec. 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally  valid data associated with the missing quality assurance, diagnostic, or  recertification tests; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or  recertification tests are completed no later than 30 days after the end  of the third calendar quarter, the test data and results may be  submitted with the third quarter report even though the test date(s) are  from the fourth calendar quarter. In this instance, if the required  tests are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation  provisions of Sec. 75.20(b)(3), all conditionally valid data associated  with the tests shall be reported as quality-assured. If the tests are  failed, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data  routine in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through Sec. 75.37 to replace with substitute  data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the failed  test(s). In addition, if the data in the second quarterly report were  flagged as conditionally valid at the end of the quarter, pending the  results of the same failed test(s), the owner or operator shall resubmit  the report for the second quarter and shall   use the appropriate missing data routine in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through  Sec. 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally  valid data associated with the failed test(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix  D of this part to determine heat input rate is required to maintain fuel  flowmeters only during the ozone season, except that for purposes of  determining the deadline for the next periodic quality assurance test on  the fuel flowmeter, the owner or operator shall include all fuel  flowmeter QA operating quarters (as defined in Sec. 72.2) for the entire  calendar year, not just fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters in the  ozone season. For each calendar year, the owner or operator shall  record, for each fuel flowmeter, the number of fuel flowmeter QA  operating quarters. The owner or operator shall include all calendar  quarters in the year when determining the deadline for visual inspection  of the primary fuel flowmeter element, as specified in section 2.1.6(c)  of appendix D to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix  D of this part to determine heat input rate is only required to sample  fuel for the purposes of determining density and GCV during the ozone  season, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling from the  fuel storage tank upon delivery must sample the tank between the date  and hour of the most recent delivery before the first date and hour that  the unit operates in the ozone season and the first date and hour that  the unit operates in the ozone season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling upon  delivery from the delivery vehicle must ensure that all shipments  received during the calendar year are sampled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling on each  day the unit combusts fuel or that performs fuel sampling continuously  must sample the fuel starting on the first day the unit operates during  the ozone season. The owner or operator then shall use that sampled  value for all hours of combustion during the first day of unit  operation, continuing until the date and hour of the next sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator shall, in accordance with Sec. 75.73,  record and report the hourly data required by this subpart and shall  record and report the results of all required quality assurance tests,  as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All hourly emission data for the period of time from May 1  through September 30 of each calendar year shall be recorded and  reported. For missing data purposes, only the data recorded in the time  period from May 1 through September 30 shall be considered quality- assured;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The results of all daily calibration error tests and flow  monitor interference checks performed in the time period from May 1  through September 30 shall be recorded and reported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For the time periods described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(C) and  (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, hourly emission data and the results of  all daily calibration error tests and flow monitor interference checks  shall be recorded. The owner or operator may opt to report unit  operating data, daily calibration error test and flow monitor  interference check results, and hourly emission data in the time period  from April 1 through April 30. However, only the data recorded in the  time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be used for  NOX mass compliance determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The results of all required quality assurance tests (RATAs,  linearity checks, flow-to-load ratio tests and leak checks) performed  during the ozone season shall be reported in the appropriate ozone  season quarterly report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The results of RATAs (and any other quality assurance test(s)  required under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section) which affect  data validation for the current ozone season, but which were performed  outside the ozone season (i.e., between January 1 and April 30 of the  current calendar year), shall be reported in the quarterly report for  the second quarter of the current calendar year (or in the report for  the third calendar quarter of the current calendar year, if the unit or  stack does not operate in the second quarter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The owner or operator shall use only quality-assured data from  within ozone seasons in the substitute data procedures under subpart D  of this part and section 2.4.2 of appendix D to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lookback periods (e.g., 2160 quality-assured monitor  operating hours for a NOX-diluent continuous emission  monitoring system, a NOX concentration monitoring system, or  a flow monitoring system) used to calculate missing data must include  only quality-assured data from periods within ozone seasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable missing data procedures of Sec. Sec. 75.31  through 75.37 shall be used, with one exception. When a fuel which has a  significantly higher NOX emission rate than any of the  fuel(s) combusted in prior ozone seasons is combusted in the unit, and  no quality-assured NOX data have been recorded in the  current, or any previous, ozone season while combusting the new fuel,  the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential  NOX emission rate, as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter,  from a NOX-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, or  the maximum potential concentration of NOX, as defined in  section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, from a NOX  concentration monitoring system. The maximum potential value used shall  be specific to the new fuel. The owner or operator shall substitute the  maximum potential value for each hour of missing NOX data  until the first hour that quality-assured NOX data are  obtained while combusting the new fuel, and then shall resume use of the  missing data routines in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through 75.37; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In order to apply the missing data routines described in  Sec. Sec. 75.31 through 75.37 on an ozone season-only basis, the  procedures in those sections shall be modified as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The use of the initial missing data procedures in Sec. 75.31  shall commence with the first unit operating hour in the first ozone  season for which emissions data are required to be reported under  Sec. 75.64.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In Sec. 75.31(a), the phrases ``During the first 720 quality- assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season'' and ``during  the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone  season'' apply respectively instead of the phrases ``During the first  720 quality-assured monitor operating hours'' and ``during the first  2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In Sec. 75.32(a), the phrases ``the first 720 quality-assured  monitor operating hours within the ozone season'' and ``the first 2,160  quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season'' apply,  respectively, instead of the phrases ``the first 720 quality-assured  monitor operating hours'' and ``the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor  operating hours''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In Sec. 75.32(a)(1), the phrase ``Following initial  certification, prior to completion of 3,672 unit (or stack) operating  hours within the ozone season'' applies instead of the phrase ``Prior to  completion of 8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours following initial  certification''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In Equation 8, the phrase ``Total unit operating hours within  the ozone season'' applies instead of the phrase ``Total unit operating  hours''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In Sec. 75.32(a)(2), the phrase ``3,672 unit (or stack)  operating hours within the ozone season'' applies instead of the phrase  ``8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> In the numerator of Equation 9, the phrase ``Total unit  operating hours within the ozone season'' applies instead of the phrase  ``Total unit operating hours'', and the phrase ``3,672 unit operating  hours within the ozone season'' applies instead of the phrase ``8,760  unit operating hours''.
