                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consideration under more than one statute. When Congress enacted  the various claims statutes, it intended to allow federal agencies to  settle meritorious claims. A claim must be considered under other  statutes in this part unless one particular statute precludes the use of  other statutes, whether the claim is filed on DD Form 1842 (Claim for  Loss of or Damage to Personal Property Incident to Service) or SF 95.  Prior to denial of an AR 27-20, chapter 11 claim, consider whether it  may fall within the scope of subparts C, D, or F of this part, and where  indicated, question the claimant to determine whether the claim sounds  in tort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusiveness of certain remedies. Certain remedies exclude all  others. For example, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive  jurisdiction over U.S. Constitution Fifth Amendment takings, express or  implied-in-fact, as well as governmental contract losses, or intangible  property losses. Claims of this nature for $10,000 or less may be filed  in a U.S. District Court. There is no administrative remedy. While the  FTCA is the preemptive tort remedy in the United States, its  commonwealths, territories and possessions, nevertheless, other remedies  must be exhausted prior to favorable consideration under the FTCA. The  FTCA does not preclude use of the MCA or the NGCA for claims arising out  of noncombat activities or brought by soldiers for incident-to-service  property losses sustained within the United States. See DA Pam 27-162,  paragraphs 2-15a and b for a more detailed discussion of determining the  correct statute for property claims versus personal injury and death  claims. In addition, it is important to consider the nature of the  claim, e.g., whether the claim may be medical malpractice in nature,  related to postal matter, or an automobile accident. Discussions of  these and many other different types of claims are also provided herein  as well as in the corresponding paragraph 2-15 of DA Pam 27-162. It is  also very important to consider when a claim may fall outside the  jurisdiction of the Army claims system. Some of these instances are  alluded to immediately above, but for a detailed discussion of related  remedies see Sec. 536.36 of this part and paragraph 2-17 of DA Pam 27- 162.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Status of Forces Agreement claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims arising out of the  performance of official duties in a foreign country where the United  States is the sending State must be filed and processed under a SOFA,  provided that the claimant is a proper party claimant under the SOFA. DA  Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-15c sets forth the rules applicable in  particular countries. A SOFA provides an exclusive remedy subject to  waiver as set forth in Sec. 536.76(h) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Single-service jurisdiction is established for all foreign  countries in which a SOFA is in effect and for certain other countries.  A list of these countries is posted on the USARCS Web site; for the  address see Sec. 536.2(a). Claims will be processed by the service  exercising single-service responsibility. In the United States, USARCS  is the receiving State office and all SOFA claims should be forwarded  immediately to USARCS for action. Appropriate investigation under  subpart B of this part procedures is required of an ACO or a CPO under  USARCS' direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign Claims Act claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims by foreign inhabitants,  arising in a foreign country, which are not cognizable under a SOFA,  fall exclusively under the FCA. The determination as to whether a  claimant is a foreign inhabitant is governed by the rules set out in  subpart C and subpart J of this part. In case of doubt, this  determination must be based on information obtained from the claimant  and others, particularly where the claimant is a former U.S. service  member or a U.S. citizen residing in a foreign country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tort claims will be processed by the armed service that  exercises single-service responsibility. When requested, the Commander  USARCS may furnish a Judge Advocate or civilian attorney to serve as a  Foreign Claims Commission (FCC) for another service. With the  concurrence of the Commander USARCS, Army JAs may be appointed as  members of another department's foreign claims commissions. See subpart  J of this part. The FCA permits compensation for damages caused by  ``out-of-scope'' tortious conduct of Soldier and civilian employees.  Many of these claims are also compensable under Article 139, Uniform  Code of Military Justice. See DA Pam 27-162, chap. 9. To avoid the  double payment of claims, ACOs and CPOs must promptly notify the Command  Claims Service of each approved Article 139 claim involving a claimant  who could also file under an applicable SOFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> National Guard Claims Act claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims attributed to the  acts or omissions of ARNG personnel in the course of employment fall  into the categories set forth in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An ACO will establish with a state claims office routine  procedures for the disposition of claims, designed to ensure that the  United States and state authorities do not issue conflicting  instructions for processing claims. The procedures will require  personnel to advise the claimant of any remedy against the state or its  insurer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the claim arises out of the act or omission of a member of  the ARNG or a person employed under 32 U.S.C. 709, it must be determined  whether the employee is acting on behalf of the state or the United  States. For example, an ARNG pilot employed under section 709 may be  flying on a state mission, federal mission, or both, on the same trip.  This determination will control the disposition of the claim. If  agreement with the concerned state cannot be reached and the claim is  otherwise payable, efforts may be made to enter into a sharing agreement  with the state concerned. The following procedures are required in the  event there is a remedy against the state and the state refuses to pay  or the state maintains insurance coverage and the claimant has filed an  administrative claim against the United States. First, forward the file  and the tort claim memorandum, including information on the status of  any judicial or administrative action the claimant has taken against the  state or its insurer to the Commander USARCS. Upon receipt, the  Commander USARCS will determine whether to require the claimant to  exhaust his or her remedy against the state or its insurer or whether  the claim against the United States can be settled without requiring  such exhaustion. If the Commander USARCS decides to follow the latter  course of action, he or she will also determine whether to obtain an  assignment of the claim against the state or its insurer and whether to  initiate recovery action to obtain contribution or indemnification. The  state or its insurer will be given appropriate notification in  accordance with state law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an administrative claim remedy exists under state law or the  state maintains liability insurance, the Commander USARCS or an ACO  acting   upon the Commander USARCS' approval may enter into a sharing agreement  covering payment of future claims. The purpose of such an agreement is  to determine in advance whether the state or the DA is responsible for  processing a claim (did the claim arise from a federal or state  mission?), to expedite payment in meritorious claims, and to preclude  double recovery by a claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Third-party claims involving an independent contractor--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Generally. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon receipt, all claims will be examined to determine  whether a contractor of the United States is the tortfeasor. If so, the  claimant or legal representative will be notified of the name and  address of the contractor and further advised that the United States is  not responsible for the acts or omissions of an independent contractor.  This will be done prior to any determination as to the contractor's  degree of culpability as compared to that of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, upon investigation, the damage is considered to be  primarily due to the contractor's fault or negligence, the claim will be  referred to the contractor or the contractor's insurance carrier for  settlement and the claimant will be so advised.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Health care providers hired under personal services contracts  under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1089 are not considered to be  independent contractors but employees of the United States for tort  claims purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims for injury or death of contractor employees. Upon receipt  of a claim for injury or death of a contractor employee, a copy of the  portions of the contract applicable to claims and workers' compensation  will be obtained, either through the contracting office or from the  contractor. Claims personnel must find out the status of any claim for  workers' compensation benefits as well as whether the United States paid  the premiums. The goal is to involve the contractor in any settlement,  where indicated, in the manner set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2- 15f and 2-61. In claims arising in foreign countries consider whether  the claim is covered by the Defense Bases Act, 42 U.S.C. 1651-1654.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Claims by contractors for damage to or loss of their property  during the performance of their contracts. Claims by contractors for  property damage or loss should be referred to the contracting officer  for determination as to whether the claim is payable under the contract.  Such a claim is not payable under the FTCA where the damage results from  an in-scope act or omission. Contract appeal procedures must be  exhausted prior to consideration as a bailment under the MCA or FCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Maritime claims. Maritime torts are excluded from consideration  under the FTCA. The various maritime statutes are exclusive remedies  within the United States and its territorial waters. Maritime statutes  include the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (AMCSA), 10 U.S.C. 4801,  4802 and 4806, the Suits in Admiralty Act (SIAA), 46 U.S.C. app. 781- 790, the Public Vessels Act (PVA), 46 U.S.C. app. 781-790, and the  Admiralty Extension Act (AEA), 46 U.S.C. app. 740. Within the U.S. and  its territorial waters, maritime suits may be filed under the SIAA or  the PVA without first filing an administrative claim, except where  administrative filing is required by the AEA. Administrative claims may  also be filed under the AMSCA. In any administrative claim brought under  the AMCSA, all action must be completed not later than two years from  its accrual date or the SOL will expire. Outside the United States, a  maritime tort may be brought under the MCA or FCA as well as the AMCSA.  The body of water on which it occurs must be navigable and a maritime  nexus must exist. Once a maritime claim is identified, give the claimant  written notice of the two-year filing requirement. In case of doubt, the  ACO or CPO should discuss the matter with the appropriate AAO. Even when  the claimant does not believe that a maritime claim is involved, provide  the claimant with precautionary notice. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2- 7e and 8-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Postal claims. See also DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15i, 2-30  and 2-56g discussing postal claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims by the U.S. Postal Service for funds and stock are  adjudicated by USARCS with assistance from the Military Postal Service  Agency and the   ACO or CPO having jurisdiction over the particular Army post office,  when directed by USARCS to assist in the investigation of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims for loss of registered and insured mail are processed  under subpart C of this part by the ACO or CPO having jurisdiction over  the particular Army post office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claims for loss of, or damage to, parcels delivered by United  Parcel Service (UPS) are the responsibility of UPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Blast damage claims. After completing an investigation and prior  to final action, all blast damage claims resulting from Army firing and  demolition activities must be forwarded to the Commander USARCS for  technical review. The sole exception to this rule is when a similar  claim is filed citing the same time, place and type of damage as one  which has already received technical review. See also DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Motor vehicle damage claims arising from the use of non- governmental vehicles. See also Sec. 536.60 (splitting property damage  and personal injury claims) and DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15k  (determining the correct statute), 2-61 (joint tort feasors), and 2-62e  (indemnity or contribution).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Government tortfeasors. A Soldier or U.S. government civilian  employee who negligently damages his or her personal property while  acting within the scope of employment is not a proper claimant for  damage to that property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims by lessors for damage to rental vehicles. Third-party  claims arising from the use of rental vehicles will be processed in the  same manner as NAFI commercially insured activities after exhaustion of  any other remedy under the Government Travel Card Program or the Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command Car Rental Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third-party damages arising from the use of privately owned  vehicles. Third-party tort claims arising within the United States from  a Soldier's use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) while allegedly  within the scope of employment must be forwarded to the Commander USARCS  for review and consultation before final action. The claim will be  investigated and any authorization for use ascertained including payment  for mileage. A copy of the Soldier's POV insurance policy will be  obtained prior to forwarding. If the DA is an additional insurer under  applicable state law, the claim will be forwarded to the Soldier's  liability carrier for payment. When the tort claim arises in a foreign  country, follow the provisions of subpart J of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Claims arising from gratuitous use of DOD or Army vehicles,  equipment or facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the commencement of any event that  involves the use of DOD or Army land, vehicles, equipment or Army  personnel for community activities, the Command involved should be  advised to first determine and weigh the risk to potential third-party  claimants against the benefits to the DOD or the Army. Where such risk  is excessive, try to obtain an agreement from the sponsoring civilian  organization holding the Army harmless. When feasible, third-party  liability insurance may be required from the sponsor and the United  States added to the policy as a third-party insured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When Army equipment and personnel are used for debris removal  relief pursuant to the Federal Disaster Relief Act, 42 U.S.C. 5173, the  state is required to assume responsibility for third-party claims. The  senior judge advocate for a task force engaged in such relief should  obtain an agreement requiring the state to hold the Army harmless and  establish a procedure for payment by the state. Claims will be received,  entered into the TSCA database, investigated and forwarded to state  authorities for action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Real estate claims. Claims for rent, damage, or other payments  involving the acquisition, use, possession or disposition of real  property or interests therein, are generally payable under AR 405-15.  These claims are handled by the Real Estate Claims Office in the  appropriate COE District or a special office created for a deployment.  Directorate of Real Estate, Office of the Chief of Engineers, has  supervisory authority. Claims for damage to real property and incidental  personal property, but not for rent (for example, claims arising during  a maneuver or   deployment) may be payable under subparts C or J of this part. However,  priority should be given to the use of AR 405-15 as it is more flexible  and expeditious. In contingency operations and deployments, there is a  large potential for overlap between contractual property damage claims  and noncombat activity/maneuver claims. Investigate carefully to ensure  the claim is in the proper channel (claims or real estate), that it is  fairly settled, and that the claimant does not receive a double payment.  For additional guidance, see subpart J of this part and United States  Army Claims Service Europe (USACSEUR) Real Estate/Office of the Judge  Advocate Standard Operating Procedures for Processing Claims Involving  Real Estate During Contingency Operations (August 20, 2002).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Claims generated by civil works projects. Civil works projects  claims arising from tortious activities are defined by whether the  negligent or wrongful act or omission arising from a project or activity  is funded by a civil works appropriation. Civil works claims are those  noncontractual claims which arise from a negligent or wrongful act or  omission during the performance of a project or activity funded by civil  works appropriations as distinguished from a project or activity funded  by Army operation and maintenance funds. Civil works claims are paid out  of civil works appropriations to the extent set forth in Sec.  536.71(f). A civil works claim can also arise out of a noncombat  activity, for example, an inverse condemnation claim in which flooding  exceeds the high water mark. Maritime claims under subpart H of this  part are civil works claims when they arise out of the operation of a  dam, locks or navigational aid.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.34: See parallel discussion at DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-1.</p>
