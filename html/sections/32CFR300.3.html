Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Search. This term includes all time spent looking, both manually and electronically, for records that are responsive to a FOIA request, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Searching for responsive emails or electronic documents located on individually-assigned computers or servers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time taken by a programmer to create a program to run a requested report from a database; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Searching through hardcopy files to include records stored at a Federal Records Center.

The process of making a copy of a document in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microfiche, audiovisual or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or compact disc), among others. Personnel time spent performing tasks to enable a computer system to output information in a particular digital form or format for a requester is considered search time. Search time is calculated according to 32 CFR part 286, subpart F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. The examination of documents located in response to a FOIA request to determine if any of the statutory exemptions permit withholding. Review also includes the time taken to redact documents, preparing them for release and reviewing submitter responses under Executive Order 12600.

DLA employee who is responsible for processing FOIA requests and is a point of contact for the FOIA program. The FOIA Officer grants or denies requests for fee waivers or expedited processing and makes requester category determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> FOIA Public Liaison.

The FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist in reducing delays, increasing transparency; increasing understanding of the status of requests and assists with resolving disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> FOIA request. A written request for DLA records that reasonably describes the record(s) sought, enabling a DLA employee familiar with the files to locate the record(s) with a reasonable amount of effort; indicates a willingness to pay processing fees or requests a fee waiver; and includes a postal mailing address and contact information. A willingness to pay fees is not required when, based upon the request, fees will not be assessed (e.g. an ``other'' requester requests a document that is certain to be less than 100 pages and will take less than two hours of search time). Written requests may be received by U.S. Postal Service or other commercial delivery means, by

facsimile, or electronically. A FOIA request meeting these conditions, arriving at DLA's FOIA Requester Service Center in possession of the requested records, is considered perfected or properly received at which time the statutory time limit for response begins. In no case shall the statutory time limit for processing a perfected request begin later than ten business days after receipt by any of DLA's FOIA Request Service Centers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Initial denial authority (IDA). By this regulation, the Director, DLA, delegates to Heads of DLA Components the authority to withhold information requested under the FOIA pursuant to one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions and to confirm that no records were located in response to a request. The designation of IDA may be further delegated by the Heads of DLA Components to their Deputies. DLA Components shall limit the number of IDAs appointed. In designating its IDAs, a DLA Component shall balance the goals of centralization of authority to promote uniform decisions and decentralization to facilitate responding to each request within the time limitations of the FOIA. IDAs may also deny a fee category claim by a requester, deny a request for expedited processing, deny a request for a waiver or reduction of fees, or review a fee estimate, although these determinations are usually made by the FOIA Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Referral. The process of transferring records found in response to a FOIA request to another DLA or DoD Component, or any Federal agency for review and direct response to the requester. This process is used when documents located during a search are found to have originated or there is a substantial interest in the record with another DLA or DoD Component, or Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Requester category. One of three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining fees for search, review and duplication. The three categories are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All others.</p>
