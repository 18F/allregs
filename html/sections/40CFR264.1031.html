                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and parts 260-266.</p><p class="depth0">Air stripping operation is a desorption operation employed to transfer one or more volatile components from a liquid mixture into a gas (air) either with or without the application of heat to the liquid. Packed towers, spray towers, and bubble-cap, sieve, or valve-type plate towers are among the process configurations used for contacting the air and a liquid.</p><p class="depth0">Bottoms receiver means a container or tank used to receive and collect the heavier bottoms fractions of the distillation feed stream that remain in the liquid phase.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from a piece or pieces of equipment to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Condenser means a heat-transfer device that reduces a thermodynamic fluid from its vapor phase to its liquid phase.</p><p class="depth0">Connector means flanged, screwed, welded, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipelines or a pipeline and a piece of equipment. For the purposes of reporting and recordkeeping, connector means flanged fittings that are

not covered by insulation or other materials that prevent location of the fittings.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous recorder means a data-recording device recording an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means an enclosed combustion device, vapor recovery system, or flare. Any device the primary function of which is the recovery or capture of solvents or other organics for use, reuse, or sale (e.g., a primary condenser on a solvent recovery unit) is not a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Control device shutdown means the cessation of operation of a control device for any purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Distillate receiver means a container or tank used to receive and collect liquid material (condensed) from the overhead condenser of a distillation unit and from which the condensed liquid is pumped to larger storage tanks or other process units.</p><p class="depth0">Distillation operation means an operation, either batch or continuous, separating one or more feed stream(s) into two or more exit streams, each exit stream having component concentrations different from those in the feed stream(s). The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor phase as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.</p><p class="depth0">Double block and bleed system means two block valves connected in series with a bleed valve or line that can vent the line between the two block valves.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each valve, pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, or flange or other connector, and any control devices or systems required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler occupied by the flame envelope.</p><p class="depth0">Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas flow is present in a vent stream.</p><p class="depth0">First attempt at repair means to take rapid action for the purpose of stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere using best practices.</p><p class="depth0">Fractionation operation means a distillation operation or method used to separate a mixture of several volatile components of different boiling points in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the components.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous waste management unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops operation of a hazardous waste management unit or part of a hazardous waste management unit. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops operation of a hazardous waste management unit or part of a hazardous waste management unit for less than 24 hours is not a hazardous waste management unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping operation are not hazardous waste management unit shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Hot well means a container for collecting condensate as in a steam condenser serving a vacuum-jet or steam-jet ejector.</p><p class="depth0">In gas/vapor service means that the piece of equipment contains or contacts a hazardous waste stream that is in the gaseous state at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">In heavy liquid service means that the piece of equipment is not in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service.</p><p class="depth0">In light liquid service means that the piece of equipment contains or contacts a waste stream where the vapor pressure of one or more of the organic components in the stream is greater than 0.3 kilopascals (kPa) at 20 C, the total concentration of the pure organic components having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals (kPa) at 20 C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight, and the fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">In situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line samplers.</p><p class="depth0">In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure that is at least 5 kPa below ambient pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Malfunction means any sudden failure of a control device or a hazardous waste management unit or failure of a hazardous waste management unit to operate in a normal or usual manner,

so that organic emissions are increased.</p><p class="depth0">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with hazardous waste and one side open to the atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth0">Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, including all fluids except water that are heated to produce steam.</p><p class="depth0">Process vent means any open-ended pipe or stack that is vented to the atmosphere either directly, through a vacuum-producing system, or through a tank (e.g., distillate receiver, condenser, bottoms receiver, surge control tank, separator tank, or hot well) associated with hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operations.</p><p class="depth0">Repaired means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak.</p><p class="depth0">Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process or waste management unit used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process or waste fluid. Equipment used to take non-routine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.</p><p class="depth0">Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.</p><p class="depth0">Separator tank means a device used for separation of two immiscible liquids.</p><p class="depth0">Solvent extraction operation means an operation or method of separation in which a solid or solution is contacted with a liquid solvent (the two being mutually insoluble) to preferentially dissolve and transfer one or more components into the solvent.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the setting in operation of a hazardous waste management unit or control device for any purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Steam stripping operation means a distillation operation in which vaporization of the volatile constituents of a liquid mixture takes place by the introduction of steam directly into the charge.</p><p class="depth0">Surge control tank means a large-sized pipe or storage reservoir sufficient to contain the surging liquid discharge of the process tank to which it is connected.</p><p class="depth0">Thin-film evaporation operation means a distillation operation that employs a heating surface consisting of a large diameter tube that may be either straight or tapered, horizontal or vertical. Liquid is spread on the tube wall by a rotating assembly of blades that maintain a close clearance from the wall or actually ride on the film of liquid on the wall.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds and does not extract energy in the form of steam or process heat.</p><p class="depth0">Vented means discharged through an opening, typically an open-ended pipe or stack, allowing the passage of a stream of liquids, gases, or fumes into the atmosphere. The passage of liquids, gases, or fumes is caused by mechanical means such as compressors or vacuum-producing systems or by process-related means such as evaporation produced by heating and not caused by tank loading and unloading (working losses) or by natural means such as diurnal temperature changes.
