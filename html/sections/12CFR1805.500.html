                            <p class="depth0">All financial assistance awarded under this part shall be matched with funds from sources other than the Federal government. Except as provided in Sec. 1805.502, such matching funds shall be provided on the basis of not less than one dollar for each dollar provided by the Fund. Funds that have been used to satisfy a legal requirement for obtaining funds under either the CDFI Program or another Federal grant or award program may not be used to satisfy the matching requirements described in this section. Community Development Block Grant Program and other funds provided pursuant to the

Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.), shall be considered Federal government funds and shall not be used to meet the matching requirements. Matching funds shall be used as provided in the Assistance Agreement. Funds that are used prior to the execution of the Assistance Agreement may nevertheless qualify as matching funds provided the Fund determines in its reasonable discretion that such use promoted the purpose of the Comprehensive Business Plan that the Fund is supporting through its assistance.</p>
