data quality, system security, accuracy, privacy protection, and other aspects of III System operation for noncriminal justice purposes.

The rule requires responsible authorized access to the System and proper use of records that are obtained from the System. The rule provides comprehensive procedures for a coordinated compliance effort among the Compact Council, the FBI, and local, State and Federal government agencies, and encourages the cooperation of all affected parties.</p>
