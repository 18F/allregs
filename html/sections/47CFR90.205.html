Except where  otherwise specifically provided for, the maximum power that will be  authorized to applicants whose license applications for new stations are  filed after August 18, 1995 is as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Below 25 MHz. For single sideband operations (J3E emission), the  maximum transmitter peak envelope power is 1000 watts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 25-50 MHz. The maximum transmitter output power is 300 watts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 72-76 MHz. The maximum effective radiated power (ERP) for  stations operating on fixed frequencies is 300 watts. Stations operating  on mobile-only frequencies are limited to one watt transmitter output  power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> 150-174 MHz. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum allowable station ERP is dependent  upon the station's antenna HAAT and required service area and will be  authorized in accordance with table 1. Applicants requesting an ERP in  excess of that listed in table 1 must submit an engineering analysis  based upon generally accepted engineering practices   and standards that includes coverage contours to demonstrate that the  requested station parameters will not produce coverage in excess of that  which the applicant requires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications for stations where special circumstances exist that  make it necessary to deviate from the ERP and antenna heights in Table 1  will be submitted to the frequency coordinator accompanied by a  technical analysis, based upon generally accepted engineering practices  and standards, that demonstrates that the requested station parameters  will not produce a signal strength in excess of 37 dBu at any point  along the edge of the requested service area. The coordinator may then  recommend any ERP appropriate to meet this condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An applicant for a station with a service area radius greater  than 40 km (25 mi) must justify the requested service area radius, which  will be authorized only in accordance with table 1, note 4.
