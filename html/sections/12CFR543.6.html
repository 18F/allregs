At such meeting, directors of the association shall be elected according to the association's charter and bylaws, and any other action permitted by such charter and bylaws may be taken; any such action shall be considered an acceptance by the association of such charter and of such bylaws, which shall be in the form provided in parts 544 and 552 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> First meeting of directors. Upon election, the association's board of directors shall hold a meeting to elect officers of the association as provided by its charter and bylaws and to take any other action necessary to permit operation of the association in accordance with law, the association's charter and bylaws, and these rules and regulations.
