                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The aggregate limit on a credit union's net member business loan balances is the lesser of 1.75 times the credit union's net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's total assets. Loans that are exempt from the definition of member business loans are not counted for the purpose of the aggregate loan limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of nonmember loans and nonmember participations. If a credit union holds any nonmember loans or nonmember loan participation interests that would constitute a member business loan if made to a member, those loans will affect the credit union's aggregate limit on net member business loan balances as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total of the credit union's net member business loan balances and the nonmember loan balances must not exceed the lesser of 1.75 times the credit union's net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's total assets, unless the credit union has first received approval from the NCUA regional director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To request approval from the NCUA regional director, a credit union must submit an application that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Includes a current copy of the credit union's member business loan policies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Confirms that the credit union is in compliance with all other aspects of this rule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> States the credit union's proposed limit on the total amount of nonmember loans and participation interests that the credit union may acquire if the application is granted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Attests that the acquisition of nonmember loans and participations is not being used, in conjunction with one or more other credit unions, to have the effect of trading member business loans that would otherwise exceed the aggregate limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A federal credit union must submit its request for approval to the regional director (a corporate federal credit union submits its request to the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision). A state chartered federally insured credit union must submit the request to its state supervisory authority. If the state supervisory authority approves the request, the state regulator will forward the application and its decision to the regional director (or if appropriate, the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision). An approved application is not effective until it is approved by the regional director (or in the case of a corporate federal credit union the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision). The regional director will issue a decision within 30 days of receipt of a federal credit union's completed application or within 30 days of receipt of a completed application and the state supervisory authority's approval for a state chartered federally insured credit union.
