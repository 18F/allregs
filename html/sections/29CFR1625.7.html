                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 4(f)(1) of the Act provides that</p><p class="depth2">* * * it shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency,  or labor organization * * * to take any action otherwise prohibited  under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section * * * where the  differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age * * *.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an employment practice uses age as a limiting criterion,  the defense that the practice is justified by a reasonable factor other  than age is unavailable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any employment practice that adversely affects individuals  within the protected age group on the basis of older age is  discriminatory unless the practice is justified by a ``reasonable factor  other than age.'' An individual challenging the allegedly unlawful  practice is responsible for isolating and identifying the specific  employment practice that allegedly causes any observed statistical  disparities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever the ``reasonable factors other than age'' defense is  raised, the employer bears the burdens of production and persuasion to  demonstrate the defense. The ``reasonable factors other than age''  provision is not available as a defense to a claim of disparate  treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reasonable factor other than age is a non-age factor that  is objectively reasonable when viewed from the position of a prudent  employer mindful of its responsibilities under the ADEA under like  circumstances. Whether a differentiation is based on reasonable factors  other than age must be decided on the basis of all the particular facts  and circumstances surrounding each individual situation. To establish  the RFOA defense, an employer must show that the employment practice was  both reasonably designed to further or achieve a legitimate business  purpose and administered in a way that reasonably achieves that purpose  in light of the particular facts and circumstances that were known, or  should have been known, to the employer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Considerations that are relevant to whether a practice is based  on a reasonable factor other than age include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which the factor is related to the employer's  stated business purpose;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the employer defined the factor accurately  and applied the factor fairly and accurately, including the extent to  which managers and supervisors were given guidance or training about how  to apply the factor and avoid discrimination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the employer limited supervisors'  discretion to assess employees subjectively, particularly where the  criteria that the supervisors were asked to evaluate are known to be  subject to negative age-based stereotypes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which the employer assessed the adverse impact of   its employment practice on older workers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The degree of the harm to individuals within the protected age  group, in terms of both the extent of injury and the numbers of persons  adversely affected, and the extent to which the employer took steps to  reduce the harm, in light of the burden of undertaking such steps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No specific consideration or combination of considerations need  be present for a differentiation to be based on reasonable factors other  than age. Nor does the presence of one of these considerations  automatically establish the defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em> exception to the Act.
