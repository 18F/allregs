A person who desires to obtain a determination under that provision of law shall follow the procedures prescribed in Sec.  479.24 relating to destructive device determinations, and shall include information as to date of manufacture, value, design and other characteristics which would sustain a finding that the firearm or device is primarily a collector's item

and is not likely to be used as a weapon.
