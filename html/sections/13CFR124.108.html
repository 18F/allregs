                                Sec. 124.108  What other eligibility requirements apply for individuals

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Good character. The applicant or Participant and all its  principals must have good character.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If during the processing of an application, adverse information  is obtained from the applicant or a credible source regarding possible  criminal conduct by the applicant or any of its principals, SBA will  suspend further processing of the application and refer it to SBA's  Office of Inspector General (OIG) for review. If SBA does not hear back  from OIG within 45 days, SBA will coordinate with OIG a suitable date to  recommence the processing of the application. The AA/BD will consider  any findings of the OIG when evaluating the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Violations of any of SBA's regulations may result in denial of  participation in the 8(a) BD program. The AA/BD will consider the nature  and severity of the violation in making an eligibility determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Debarred or suspended concerns or concerns owned by debarred or  suspended persons are ineligible for admission to the 8(a) BD program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An applicant is ineligible for admission to the 8(a) BD program  if the applicant concern or a proprietor, partner, limited liability  member, director, officer, or holder of at least 10 percent of its  stock, or another person (including key employees) with significant  authority over the concern:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lacks business integrity as demonstrated by information related  to an indictment or guilty plea, conviction, civil judgment, or  settlement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is currently incarcerated, or on parole or probation pursuant  to a pre-trial diversion or following conviction for a felony or any  crime involving business integrity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If, during the processing of an application, SBA determines that  an applicant has knowingly submitted false information, regardless of  whether correct information would cause SBA to deny the application, and  regardless of whether correct information was given to SBA in  accompanying documents,   SBA will deny the application. If, after admission to the program, SBA  discovers that false information has been knowingly submitted by a firm,  SBA will initiate termination proceedings and suspend the firm under  Secs. 124.304 and 124.305. Whenever SBA determines that the applicant  submitted false information, the matter will be referred to SBA's Office  of Inspector General for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One-time eligibility. Once a concern or disadvantaged individual  upon whom eligibility was based has participated in the 8(a) BD program,  neither the concern nor that individual will be eligible again.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual who claims disadvantage and completes the  appropriate SBA forms to qualify an applicant has participated in the  8(a) BD program if SBA approves the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of eligibility will take effect on the date of the concern's  approval for admission into the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An individual who uses his or her one-time eligibility to  qualify a concern for the 8(a) BD program will be considered a non- disadvantaged individual for ownership or control purposes of another  applicant or Participant. The criteria restricting participation by non- disadvantaged individuals will apply to such an individual. See  Secs. 124.105 and 124.106.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When at least 50% of the assets of a concern are the same as  those of a former Participant, the concern will not be eligible for  entry into the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Participants which change their form of business organization  and transfer their assets and liabilities to the new organization may do  so without affecting the eligibility of the new organization provided  the previous business is dissolved and all other eligibility criteria  are met. In such a case, the new organization may complete the remaining  program term of the previous organization. A request for a change in  business form will be treated as a change of ownership under  Sec. 124.105(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wholesalers. An applicant concern seeking admission to the 8(a)  BD program as a wholesaler need not demonstrate that it is capable of  meeting the requirements of the nonmanufacturer rule for its primary  industry classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Brokers. Brokers are ineligible to participate in the 8(a) BD  program. A broker is a concern that adds no material value to an item  being supplied to a procuring activity or which does not take ownership  or possession of or handle the item being procured with its own  equipment or facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federal financial obligations. Neither a firm nor any of its  principals that fails to pay significant financial obligations owed to  the Federal Government, including unresolved tax liens and defaults on  Federal loans or other Federally assisted financing, is eligible for  admission to or participation in the 8(a) BD program.
