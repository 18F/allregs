For example, ``CSRS,'' ``FERS,''  ``OPM,'' or ``Federal Government'' benefits, or benefits payable ``based  on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' etc., are  sufficient identification of the retirement system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for  employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits  apply to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if  any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec.  838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A court order affecting military retired pay, even when military  retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, does not  award a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of  employee contributions under CSRS or FERS. Such a court order does not  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.303(b)(1) or Sec. 838.502(b)(1).</p>
