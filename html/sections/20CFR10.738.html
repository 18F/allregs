                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Benefits are payable when an officer is injured while  apprehending, or attempting to apprehend, an individual for the  commission of a Federal crime. However, either an actual Federal crime  must be in progress or have been committed, or objective evidence (of  which the officer is aware at the time of injury) must exist that a  potential Federal crime was in progress or had already been committed.  The actual or potential Federal crime must be an integral part of the  criminal activity toward which the officer's actions are directed. The  fact that an injury to an officer is related in some way to the  commission of a Federal crime does not necessarily bring the injury  within the coverage of the FECA. The FECA is not intended to cover  officers who are merely enforcing local laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For benefits to be payable when an officer is injured  preventing, or attempting to prevent, a Federal crime, there must be  objective evidence that a Federal crime is about to be committed. An  officer's belief, unsupported by objective evidence, that he or she is  acting to prevent the commission of a Federal crime will not result in  coverage. Moreover, the officer's subjective intent, as measured by all  available evidence (including the officer's own statements and  testimony, if available), must have been directed toward the prevention  of a Federal crime. In this context, an officer's own statements and  testimony are relevant to, but do not control, the determination of  coverage.</p>
