Should RUS determine that the borrower has made disbursements of funds advanced pursuant to RUS Notes which do not comply with the requirements of the RUS Loan Agreement, the borrower shall be required to pay to the Government an amount equal to the difference between the amount which the borrower prepaid on such RUS Notes evidencing RUS loan funds which were improperly disbursed and the amount which the borrower would otherwise have been required to return to the Government as a result of noncompliance if the borrower had not prepaid such RUS Notes.
