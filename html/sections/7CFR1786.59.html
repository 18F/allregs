Should RUS determine that the  borrower has made disbursements of funds advanced pursuant to RUS Notes  which do not comply with the requirements of the RUS Loan Agreement, the  borrower shall be required to pay to the Government an amount equal to  the difference between the amount which the borrower prepaid on such RUS  Notes evidencing RUS loan funds which were improperly disbursed and the  amount which the borrower would otherwise have been required to return  to the Government as a result of noncompliance if the borrower had not  prepaid such RUS Notes.
