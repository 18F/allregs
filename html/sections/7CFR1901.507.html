                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Orders and payment. Orders for investment in certificates may be  placed with the Finance Office by mail, telephone, or in person. Payment  for purchase of certificates may be made by a wire transfer to the  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for credit to the Farmers Home  Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, by a  certified check or bank draft payable to the Farmers Home Administration  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The rate of interest  paid on the certificate will be the rate in effect on the date the  Finance Office receives the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Registration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The registration used must express the actual  ownership of a certificate and may not restrict the authority of the  owner to dispose of it in any manner. FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 reserves the right to treat the registration as  conclusive ownership. Request for registration must be clear, accurate,  and complete, and include the appropriate taxpayer identifying number or  social security number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The registration of all certificates owned by the same person,  organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect to the name of  the owner and, in case of fiduciary, the description of the fiduciary  capacity. Individual owners should be designated by the names by which  they are ordinarily known or under which they do business, preferably  including at least one full given name. The name of an individual may be  preceded by an applicable title, as, for example ``Mrs.'', ``Mr.'',  ``Miss'', ``Ms.'', ``Dr.'', or ``Rev.'', or followed by a designation  such as ``M.D.'', ``D.D.'', ``Sr.'', or ``Jr.'', Any other similar  suffix should be included when ordinarily used or when necessary to  distinguish the owner from another member of his family. The address  should include, where appropriate, the name and street, route, or any  other location feature, and zip code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an erroneously inscribed certificate is received, it should  not be altered in any respect. FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 should be given full particulars about the error and asked  to furnish instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfers and exchanges--closed periods--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Transfer  of registered certificates should be made by assignment in accordance  with this section. Registered securities are eligible for denominational  exchange. Specific instructions for issuance and delivery of new  certificates signed by the owner or the owner's authorized  representative must accompany the certificates presented. Certificates  presented for transfer must be received by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 not less than 1 full month before the date on  which they mature. Any certificates so presented which are received too  late to comply with this provision will be accepted for payment only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Closing of transfer books. The transfer books are closed for 1  full month preceding interest payment dates. If the date set for closing  falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the books will be closed  as of the close of business on the last business day preceding that  date. The books are reopened on the first business day following the  date on which interest falls due. Registered certificates which have not  matured, or have been submitted for transfer and are received when the  books are closed for that certificate, will be processed on or after the  date such books are reopened. If certificates are received for transfer  when the books are closed for payment of final   interest at maturity, the following action will be taken in the absence  of different instructions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment of final interest will be made to the registered owner  of record on the date the books were closed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payment of principal will be made to the assignee under a  proper assignment of the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Redemption or payment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Certificates are payable in  regular course of business at maturity. FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 may provide for the exchange of maturing  certificates. The registered certificates should be presented and  surrendered for redemption at the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Finance Office. No assignments or evidence in support  of them will be required by or on behalf of the registered owner or  assignee for redemption for his or its account, or for redemption- exchange if the new certificates are to be registered in exactly the  same names and forms as in the registrations or assignments of the  certificates surrendered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Redemption at maturity. Registered certificates presented and  surrendered for redemption at maturity need not be assigned unless the  owner desires that payment be made to some other person. Should the  owner so desire assignments should be made to the ``Farmers Home  Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for  redemption for the account of (inserting name and address of person to  whom payment is to be made).'' Specific instructions for the issuance  and delivery of the redemption check signed by the owner or the owner's  authorized representative must accompany the certificates unless  included in the assignment. Payment of the principal and interest will  be made by a check drawn on the Treasurer of the United States to the  order of the person entitled and mailed in accordance with the  instructions received. If instructions are not received concerning  interest, interest will be paid to the registered owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest. The interest on FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 certificates accrues and is payable annually. A full  interest period does not include the day on which the last preceding  interest became due, but does include the day on which the next  succeeding interest payment is due. Certificates will cease to bear  interest on the date of their maturity. The interest on registered  certificates is payable by checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United  States to the order of the registered owners, except as otherwise  provided in this section. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 prepares the interest checks in advance of the interest payment  date and ordinarily mails them in time to reach the addressees on that  date. Interest on a registered certificate which has not matured and  which is presented for any transaction when the books for that  certificate are closed will be paid by check drawn to the order of the  registered owner of record. On receipt of notice of the death or  incompetency of an individual named as registered owner, a change in the  name or in the status of a partnership, corporation, or unincorporated  association, the removal, resignation, succession, or death of a  fiduciary or trustee, delivery of interest checks will be withheld  pending receipt and approval of evidence showing who is entitled to  receive the interest checks. If the inscriptions on certificates do not  clearly identify the owners, delivery of interest checks may be withheld  pending reissue of the certificates in the correct registration, except  as provided in this section. The final installment of interest will be  paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record on  presentation and surrender of the certificate for redemption. To assure  timely delivery of interest checks, owners should promptly notify FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of any change of  address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assignments. Assignments of certificates should be executed by  the owner or the owner's authorized representative in the presence of an  officer authorized to certify assignments. Assignments shall be made on  the back of the certificate. Registered certificates may be assigned to  a specified transferee or to FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 for redemption or for exchange for other certificates  offered at maturity. Assignments to ``United States, Farmers Home  Administration or its successor   agency under Public Law 103-354,'' ``Farmers Home Administration or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for Transfer,'' or ``Farmers  Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for  Exchange'' will not be accepted unless supplemented by specific  instructions by or in behalf of the owner. If an alteration or erasure  has been made in an assignment, a new assignment from the assignor  should be obtained. Otherwise, an affidavit or explanation by the person  responsible for the alteration or erasure should be submitted for  consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Death of certificate holder. The Finance Office should be  notified of the death of the registered owner of a certificate. The  following documents should be forwarded with the notice if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certified copy of the death certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certified copy of the court order appointing the Administrator  or Executor (include the mailing address of the Administrator or  Executor). The Finance Office will notify the person submitting such  notice and/or documentation if any other records or documents are  needed. Legal opinions and advice will be obtained by the Finance Office  as needed from the Regional Attorney. After all legal requirements are  met, the certificate should be reissued in the name of the current  owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Replacement. Lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated certificates  will be replaced by the Finance Office on the registered owner's  compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1901.509.</p>
