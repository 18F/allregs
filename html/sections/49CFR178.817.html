                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The righting test must be conducted for the  qualification of all flexible IBCs designed to be lifted from the top or  side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special preparation for the righting test. The flexible IBC must  be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum  net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test method. The flexible IBC, lying on its side, must be lifted  at a speed of at least 0.1 m/second (0.33 ft/s) to an upright position,  clear of the floor, by one lifting device, or by two lifting devices  when four are provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criterion for passing the test. For all flexible IBCs, there may  be no damage to the IBC or its lifting devices which renders the IBC  unsafe for transportation or handling.
