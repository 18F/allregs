record concerning the amount of recovery, provided the Board notified the parties before the hearing began that its decision would not address the amount of any recovery. In any instance in which the Board has reserved its determination of the amount of recovery for other proceedings, as provided in 6101.21(a)(4) (Rule 21(a)(4)), its decision on the question of the right to recover shall be final so far as proceedings at the Board are concerned, subject to the provisions of 6101.26 through 6101.28 (Rules 26 through 28).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlements. When an appeal or application is settled, the parties may file with the Board a stipulation setting forth the amount of the award. The Board will adopt the parties' stipulation by decision, provided the stipulation states the parties will not seek reconsideration of, or relief from, the Board's decision, and they will not appeal the decision. The Board's decision under this paragraph (b) is an adjudication of the case on the merits.
