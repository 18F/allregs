If chromatographic peaks are found with RA values between 10 and 25, the food additive shall meet the requirements of the bioassay method prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for determining chick-edema factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unsaponifiable matter shall be determined by the method described in the 13th Ed. (1980) of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' which is incorporated by reference.

addition to the other information required by the act, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The common or usual name of the acid or acids contained therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The words ``food grade,'' in juxtaposition with and equally as prominent as the name of the acid.
