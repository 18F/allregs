                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The Act is intended, in part, to protect the quality,  safety, durability, and affordability of manufactured homes. Section  623(c)(12) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5422 (c)(12)) requires the  implementation of ``a dispute resolution program for the timely  resolution of disputes between manufacturers, retailers, and installers  of manufactured homes regarding responsibility, and for the issuance of  appropriate orders, for the correction or repair of defects in  manufactured homes that are reported during the 1-year period beginning  on the date of installation.'' The purpose of this part is to provide a  dispute resolution program for the timely resolution of disputes among  manufacturers, retailers, and installers regarding the responsibility  for correction or repair of defects reported by the homeowner or others  and reported in the 1-year period after the first installation of the  manufactured home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. In carrying out this purpose, it is  presumed that if a manufactured home contains an alleged defect that is  reported in the first year after installation and was not caused by the  homeowner, then the manufacturer, retailer, or installer is responsible  for the alleged defect and the dispute resolution process recognized in  this part is an appropriate means for resolving disputes about  responsibility for correction and repair of the alleged defect. For  purposes of the dispute resolution process recognized in this part, only  alleged defects reported in the first year after the first installation  are covered by the process. The state where the home is sited determines  whether the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program or a state  program applies. Subpart A of this part establishes general provisions  applicable to HUD's implementation of a dispute resolution program as  required by the Act. Subpart B of this part establishes the HUD  Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program that HUD will administer in  any state that does not establish a program that complies with the Act  and been accepted by HUD as provided in subpart D of this part. Subpart  C of this part provides an Alternative Process for manufacturers,  retailers, and installers who agree that a homeowner is not responsible  for the alleged defect to resolve their disputes about responsibility  for correction or repair outside of the HUD Mediation and Arbitration  Process under subpart B. Subpart D of this part establishes the minimum  requirements that must be met by a state applying to implement its own  dispute resolution program that complies with the Act, and the procedure  for determining whether the requirements for complying have been met.  Subpart E of this part establishes special rulemaking procedures that  apply to the issuance of new regulations that implement the dispute  resolution requirements set forth in section 623 of the Act (42 U.S.C.  5422).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Warranties not affected. This part is not a warranty program and  the requirements established in this part do not replace the  manufacturer's or any other warranty program. Such warranty program may  have its own requirements.</p>
