                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To evaluate skills and to help determine the existence  in the national economy of work the claimant is able to do, occupations  are classified as unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled. In classifying  these occupations, the Board uses materials published by the Department  of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unskilled work. Unskilled work is work which needs little or no  judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short  period of time (30 days). The job may or may not require considerable  strength. A job is considered unskilled if the claimant can usually  learn to do the job in 30 days, and little job training and judgment are  needed. The claimant does not gain work skills by doing unskilled jobs.  For example, jobs are considered unskilled if primary work duties are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Handling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Feeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offbearing (placing or removing materials from machines which  are automatic or operated by others); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Machine tending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Semi-skilled work. Semi-skilled work is work which needs some  skills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. A job  may be classified as semi-skilled where coordination and dexterity are  necessary, as when hand or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive  tasks. Semi-skilled jobs may require--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alertness and close attention to watching machine processes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspecting, testing, or otherwise looking for irregularities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons  against loss, damage, or injury; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other types of activities which are similarly less complex than  skilled work but more complex than unskilled work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Skilled work. Skilled work requires qualifications in which a  person uses judgment to determine the machine and manual operations to  be performed in order to obtain the proper form, quality, or quantity of  material to be produced. Skilled jobs may require--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Laying out work;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimating quality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining suitability and needed quantities of materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Making precise measurements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reading blueprints or other specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Making necessary computations or mechanical adjustments to  control or regulate work; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Dealing with people, facts, figures or abstract ideas at a high  level of complexity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Skills that can be used in other work (transferability)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  What the Board means by transferable skills. The Board considers the  claimant to have skills that can be used in other jobs, when the skilled  or semi-skilled work activities the claimant did in past work can be  used to meet the requirements of skilled or semi-skilled work activities  of other jobs or kinds of work. This depends largely on the similarity  of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How the Board determines skills that can be transferred to other  jobs. Transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in  which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The same or a lesser degree of skill is required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The same or similar tools and machines are used; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The same or similar raw materials, products, processes, or  services are involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Degrees of transferability. There are degrees of transferability  of skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidental  similarities among jobs. A complete similarity of all three factors is  not necessary for transferability. However, when skills are so  specialized or have been acquired in such an isolated vocational setting  (like many jobs in mining, agriculture, or fishing) that they are not  readily usable in other industries, jobs, and work settings, they are  considered not transferable.</p>
