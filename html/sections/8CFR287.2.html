In no case shall this investigation prejudice the right of an arrested person to be taken without unnecessary delay before a United States

magistrate judge, a United States district judge, or, if necessary, a judicial officer empowered in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3041 to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.
