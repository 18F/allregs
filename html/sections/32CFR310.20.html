When replying to a constituent inquiry and the fees involved are substantial, consider suggesting to the Congressman that the constituent can obtain the information directly by writing to the appropriate offices and paying the costs. When practical, suggest to the Congressman that the record can be examined at no cost if the constituent wishes to visit the custodian of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reproduction fees computation.
