The discussion is designed to explain and illustrate the application of the term in some cases; in others, the discussion may serve as a guide in applying the criteria of the definition to the particular fact situation. A more complete discussion is contained in part 776 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Covered Enterprises</p>
