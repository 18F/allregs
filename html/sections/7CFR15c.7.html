                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing of complaints. Any person who believes he/she or any  specific class of individuals has been subject to discrimination by a  recipient or believes that the recipient is otherwise in noncompliance  with the provisions of the Age Act or this regulation may file a  complaint with OASCR. The USDA Program Discrimination Complaint Form may  be used to file a complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place of filing. All age discrimination complaints  alleging discrimination or noncompliance must be filed within 180 days  of the last discriminatory act, to be timely. All complaints under this  part shall be filed with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil  Rights, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of rights and responsibilities. USDA shall provide notice  to the complainant and the recipient of their:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rights and obligations under complaint procedures including  their right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint  process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rights to contact the agency for information and assistance  regarding the complaint resolution process; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obligation to participate actively in efforts toward speedy  resolution of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mediation of complaints. All complaints that allege  discrimination based on age shall be mediated in an attempt to resolve  disputes at the earliest stage possible. The complainant and the  recipient are required to participate in the mediation process. If the  complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of  the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the  agreement to writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Investigation of complaints. If the parties are unable to reach  a resolution, USDA shall investigate the complaint. During the  investigation of the complaint, OASCR or an agency delegated complaint  processing authority   shall use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate  discussions with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts  and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually  agreeable to the parties. USDA may seek the assistance of any involved  State agency. If informal resolution efforts are unsuccessful, OASCR  shall complete the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Final determination. After a complete investigation, OASCR shall  make a final determination as to the merits of the complaint. The  complainant shall be notified of the final determination and provided  notice of his or her right to file a civil action under the Age Act, 42  U.S.C. 6104(e), and 15c.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Voluntary compliance. If OASCR or an agency delegated complaint  processing authority finds that age discrimination has occurred, USDA  shall attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. The recipient shall take  any remedial action which USDA may require to overcome the effects of  discrimination. If USDA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it shall  undertake enforcement of the Age Act and this regulation.</p>
