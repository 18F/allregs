The Inmate Handbook will  be made available to all persons at the time they are incarcerated or  detained in a facility. There may be times when this may be delayed due  to the physical or mental condition of the person at time of  incarceration. In these cases, the Inmate Handbook will be made  available when the person is deemed receptive and cognizant by the  detention officer in charge. All policies, standards, procedures, and  guidelines are available at each facility to the public or by writing to  the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.
