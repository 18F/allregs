                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. The main objectives are to facilitate full exercise of rights  conferred on individuals under the Act and to insure the protection of  privacy as to individuals about whom the Department maintains records in  systems of records under the Act. The Department accepts the  responsibility to act promptly and in accordance with the Act upon  receipt of any inquiry, request or appeal from a citizen of the United  States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the  United States, regardless of the age of the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Further, the Department accepts the obligations to maintain only  such information on individuals as is relevant and necessary to the  performance of its lawful functions, to maintain that information with  such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably  necessary to assure fairness in determinations made by the Department  about the individual, to obtain information from the individual to the  extent practicable, and to take every reasonable step to protect that  information from unwarranted disclosure. The Department will maintain no  record describing how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the  First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the  individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to  and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part applies to all organizational components in the  Department in order to assure the maximum amount of uniformity and  consistency within the Department in its implementation of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Assistant Secretary for Administration shall be responsible  for carrying out the requirements of this part, for issuing such orders  and directives internal to the Department as are necessary for full  compliance with the Act, and for effecting publication of all   required notices concerning systems of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requests involving information pertaining to an individual which  is in a record or file but not within the scope of a System of Records  Notice published in the Federal Register are outside the scope of this  part. Requests for departmental records will be considered to determine  whether processing under this part, part 15, or both is most  appropriate, notwithstanding the requester's characterization of the  request, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about that  individual and not contained in a Privacy Act Records System shall be  considered a Freedom of Information Act request and processed under HUD  Freedom of Information Act regulations (24 CFR part 15) to the extent  that the requester has provided the Department a reasonable description  of the documents requested. When a request for records is so considered  as a Freedom of Information Act request, the Privacy Act Officer shall  promptly refer it to the head of the appropriate organizational unit in  accordance with HUD FOIA Regulations and shall advise the requester that  time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is  received by the appropriate official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for  records about that individual contained in a Privacy Act Records System  shall be processed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the request in whole or in part contains a reasonable  description of any HUD document, processing shall be carried out  pursuant to HUD FOIA Regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the request in whole or in part does not contain a  reasonable description of any HUD document, but does provide sufficient  information under HUD Privacy Act Regulations to undertake a Privacy Act  Records System search, the Department will provide full access under HUD  Privacy Act Regulations. In this situation, the Department will comply  with the deadlines for response set forth in the Privacy Act and HUD  implementing regulations. In that event, an explanation will be provided  to the requester advising that the request did not contain a reasonable  description of a particular document as required under the FOIA and  offering to process the request under FOIA procedures upon receipt of  additional information sufficient to constitute a reasonable  description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for  records about another individual contained in a Privacy Act Records  System shall be processed as follows: When an exemption under subsection  (b) of FOIA is available, the Privacy Act governs the public interest  determination under HUD FOIA Regulations (24 CFR 15.21) and compels the  withholding of such documents unless: (i) The subject of those records  consents to their release or (ii) disclosure comes within one of the  subsections of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about  another individual shall be processed as follows: Except as expressly  permitted in this part, requests by persons who are not the subject of a  record contained in a Privacy Act Records System shall be outside the  scope of this part. If the request satisfies the Freedom of Information  Act requirement that requested records be reasonably described, the  Privacy Act Officer shall consider the requests as a Freedom of  Information Act request and shall proceed as in Sec. 16.1(e)(1) of this  section.
