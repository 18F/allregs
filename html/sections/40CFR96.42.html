all such NOX Budget units for the control period under paragraph (c)(1) of this section so that the total number of NOX allowances allocated equals 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the number of tons of NOX emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned to non-electric generating units. This adjustment will be made by: multiplying each unit's allocation by 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the number of tons of NOX emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned to non-electric generating units divided by the total number of NOX allowances allocated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and rounding to the nearest whole NOX allowance as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each control period under Sec. 96.41, the permitting authority will allocate NOX allowances to NOX Budget units under Sec. 96.4 in the State that commenced operation, or is projected to commence operation, on or after May 1 of the period used to calculate heat input under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in accordance with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The permitting authority will establish one allocation set-aside for each control period.

The NOX allowance allocation request must be submitted prior to May 1 of the first control period for which the NOX allowance allocation is requested and after the date on which the permitting authority issues a permit to construct the NOX Budget unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a NOX allowance allocation request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the NOX authorized account representative for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) may request for a control period NOX allowances in an amount that does not exceed 0.15 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the NOX Budget unit's maximum design heat input (in mmBtu/hr) multiplied by the number of hours remaining in the control period starting with the first day in the control period on which the unit operated or is projected to operate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In a NOX allowance allocation request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the NOX authorized account representative for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) may request for a control period NOX allowances in an amount that does not exceed 0.17 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the NOX Budget unit's maximum design heat input (in mmBtu/hr) multiplied by the number of hours remaining in the control period starting with the first day in the control period on which the unit operated or is projected to operate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The permitting authority will review, and allocate NOX allowances pursuant to, each NOX allowance allocation request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in the order that the request is received by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon receipt of the NOX allowance allocation request, the permitting authority will determine whether, and will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that, for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(1), the control period and the number of allowances specified are consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section and, for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2), the control period and the number of allowances specified are consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the allocation set-aside for the control period for which NOX allowances are requested has an amount of NOX allowances not less than the number requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section), the permitting authority will allocate the

amount of the NOX allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section) to the NOX Budget unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the allocation set-aside for the control period for which NOX allowances are requested has a smaller amount of NOX allowances than the number requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section), the permitting authority will deny in part the request and allocate only the remaining number of NOX allowances in the allocation set-aside to the NOX Budget unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Once an allocation set-aside for a control period has been depleted of all NOX allowances, the permitting authority will deny, and will not allocate any NOX allowances pursuant to, any NOX allowance allocation request under which NOX allowances have not already been allocated for the control period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Within 60 days of receipt of a NOX allowance allocation request, the permitting authority will take appropriate action under paragraph (d)(5) of this section and notify the NOX authorized account representative that submitted the request and the Administrator of the number of NOX allowances (if any) allocated for the control period to the NOX Budget unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For a NOX Budget unit that is allocated NOX allowances under paragraph (d) of this section for a control period, the Administrator will deduct NOX allowances under Sec. 96.54(b) or (e) to account for the actual utilization of the unit during the control period. The Administrator will calculate the number of NOX allowances to be deducted to account for the unit's actual utilization using the following formulas and rounding to the nearest whole NOX allowance as appropriate, provided that the number of NOX allowances to be deducted shall be zero if the number calculated is less than zero:
NOX allowances deducted for actual utilization for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) = (Unit's NOX allowances allocated for control period)-(Unit's actual control period utilization x 0.15 lb/mmBtu); andNOX allowances deducted for actual utilization for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) = (Unit's NOX allowances allocated for control period)-(Unit's actual control period utilization x 0.17 lb/mmBtu)
Where:
``Unit's NOX allowances allocated for control period'' is the</p><p class="depth2">number of NOX allowances allocated to the unit for</p><p class="depth2">the control period under paragraph (d) of this section; and``Unit's actual control period utilization'' is the utilization (in</p><p class="depth2">mmBtu), as defined in Sec. 96.2, of the unit during the</p><p class="depth2">control period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After making the deductions for compliance under Sec. 96.54(b) or (e) for a control period, the Administrator will notify the permitting authority whether any NOX allowances remain in the allocation set-aside for the control period. The permitting authority will allocate any such NOX allowances to the NOX Budget units in the State using the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole NOX allowance as appropriate:
Unit's share of NOX allowances remaining in allocation set-aside = Total NOX allowances remaining in allocation set-aside x (Unit's NOX allowance allocation / State trading program budget excluding allocation set-aside)
Where:
``Total NOX allowances remaining in allocation set-aside'' is</p><p class="depth2">the total number of NOX allowances remaining in the</p><p class="depth2">allocation set-aside for the control period to which the</p><p class="depth2">allocation set-aside applies;``Unit's NOX allowance allocation'' is the number of</p><p class="depth2">NOX allowances allocated under paragraph (b) or (c)</p><p class="depth2">of this section to the unit for the control period to which</p><p class="depth2">the allocation set-aside applies; and``State trading program budget excluding allocation set-aside'' is the</p><p class="depth2">State trading program budget under Sec. 96.40 for the control</p><p class="depth2">period to which the allocation set-aside applies multiplied by</p><p class="depth2">95 percent if the control period is in 2003, 2004, or 2005 or</p><p class="depth2">98 percent if the control period is in any year thereafter,</p><p class="depth2">rounded to the nearest whole NOX allowance as</p><p class="depth2">appropriate.
