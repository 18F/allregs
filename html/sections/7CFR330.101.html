The Deputy Administrator shall employ procedures to carry out this purpose which will impose a minimum of impediment to foreign commerce and travel whenever practicable, consistent with proper precaution against plant pest dissemination. The same policy is to be applied in the case of interstate commerce and travel.</p>
