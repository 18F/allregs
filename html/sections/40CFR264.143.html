                            <p class="depth0">An owner or operator of each facility must establish financial assurance for closure of the facility. He must choose from the options as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Closure trust fund. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a closure trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a closure trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator.

Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the current closure cost estimate covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payments into the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the term of the initial RCRA permit or over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is hereafter referred to as the ``pay-in period.'' The payments into the closure trust fund must be made as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a new facility, the first payment must be made before the initial receipt of hazardous waste for treatment, storage, or disposal. A receipt from the trustee for this payment must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in Sec. 264.143(g), divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU92.050



where CE is the current closure cost estimate, CV is the current value</p><p class="depth4">of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in</p><p class="depth4">the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an owner or operator establishes a trust fund as specified in Sec. 265.143(a) of this chapter, and the value of that trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a permit is awarded for the facility, the amount of the current closure cost estimate still to be paid into the trust fund must be paid in over the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Payments must continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made pursuant to part 265 of this chapter. The amount of each payment must be determined by this formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU92.050

However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the owner or operator establishes a closure trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms specified in this section or in Sec. 265.143 of this chapter, his first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made according to specifications of this paragraph and Sec. 265.143(a) of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After the pay-in period is completed, whenever the current closure cost estimate changes, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the current closure cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the value of the trust fund is greater than the total amount of the current closure cost estimate, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If an owner or operator substitutes other financial assurance as specified in this section for all or part of the trust fund, he may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost estimate covered by the trust fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Within 60 days after receiving a request from the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in paragraph (a) (7) or (8) of this section, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to release to the owner or operator such funds as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> After beginning partial or final closure, an owner or operator or another person authorized to conduct partial or final closure may request reimbursements for partial or final closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if sufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after receiving bills for partial or final closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the value of the trust

fund, he may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with Sec. 264.143(i) that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, he will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The Regional Administrator will agree to termination of the trust when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with Sec. 264.143(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund.

Actual payments by the insurer will not change the face amount, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The closure insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to close the facility whenever final closure occurs.

Within 60 days after receiving bills for closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements in such amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the face amount of the policy, he may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with Sec. 264.143(i), that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility.

Such violation will be deemed to begin upon receipt by the Regional Administrator of a notice of future cancellation, termination, or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than upon the date of expiration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending notice by certified mail to the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the notice by both the Regional Administrator and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the return receipts.

To pass this test the owner or operator must meet the criteria of either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must have:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Two of the following three ratios: a ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must have:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A current rating for his most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by Moody's; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Tangible net worth at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The phrase ``current closure and post-closure cost estimates'' as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (Sec. 264.151(f)). The phrase ``current plugging and abandonment cost estimates'' as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (Sec. 144.70(f) of this title).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in Sec. 264.151(f); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator stating that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> He has compared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In connection with that procedure, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, he must send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The notice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or operator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of such a finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Regional Administrator may disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the independent certified public accountant in his report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of the disallowance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with Sec. 264.143(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee. The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 264.151(h). The certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this ``substantial business relationship'' and the value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator fails to perform final closure of a facility covered by the corporate guarantee in accordance with the closure plan and other permit requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or establish a trust fund as specified in Sec. 264.143(a) in the name of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corporate guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain the written approval of such alternate

assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the corporate guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide such alternative financial assurance in the name of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use of multiple financial mechanisms. An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust fund may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for closure of the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA Identification Number, name, address, and the amount of funds for closure assured by the mechanism. If the facilities covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each facility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for closure of any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator agrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and a qualified Professional Engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that final closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator a detailed written statement of any such reason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan.
