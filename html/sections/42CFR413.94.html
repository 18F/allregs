                                Sec. 413.94  Value of services of nonpaid workers.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principle. The value of services in positions customarily held by full-time employees performed on a regular, scheduled basis by individuals as nonpaid members of organizations under arrangements between such organizations and a provider for the performance of such services without direct remuneration from the provider to such individuals is allowable as an operating expense for the determination of allowable cost subject to the limitation contained in paragraph (b) of this section. The amounts allowed are not to exceed those paid others for similar work. Such amounts must be identifiable in the records of the institutions as a legal obligation for operating expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations: Services of nonpaid workers. The services must be performed on a regular, scheduled basis in positions customarily held by full-time employees and necessary to enable the provider to carry out the functions of normal patient care and operation of the institution. The value of services of a type for which providers generally do not remunerate individuals performing such services is not allowable as a reimbursable cost under the Medicare program. For example, donated services of individuals in distributing books and magazines to patients, or in serving in a provider canteen or cafeteria or in a provider gift shop, would not be reimbursable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. The following illustrates how a provider would determine an amount to be allowed under this principle: The prevailing salary for a lay nurse working in Hospital A is $5,000 for the year. The lay nurse receives no maintenance or special perquisites. A sister working as a nurse engaged in the same activities in the same hospital receives maintenance and special perquisites which cost the hospital $2,000 and are included in the hospital's allowable operating costs. The hospital would then include in its records an additional $3,000 to bring the value of the services rendered to $5,000. The amount of $3,000 would be allowable if the provider assumes obligation for the expense under a written agreement with the sisterhood or other religious order covering payment by the provider for the services.</p>
