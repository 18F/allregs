For this purpose, VA considers that an emergency ends when the designated VA clinician at the VA facility has determined that, based on sound medical judgment, a veteran who received emergency treatment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Could have been transferred from the non-VA facility to a VA medical center (or other Federal facility that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services for veterans) for continuation of treatment, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Could have reported to a VA medical center (or other Federal facility that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services for veterans) for continuation of treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims for payment or reimbursement of the costs of emergency treatment not previously authorized may be approved for continued, non-emergency treatment, only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The non-VA facility notified VA at the time the veteran could be safely transferred to a VA facility (or other Federal facility that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services for veterans) and the transfer of the veteran was not accepted, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The non-VA facility made and documented reasonable attempts to request transfer of the veteran to VA (or to another Federal facility that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services for veterans), which means the non-VA facility contacted either the VA Transfer Coordinator, Administrative Officer of the Day, or designated staff responsible for accepting transfer of patients at a local VA (or other Federal facility) and documented such contact in the veteran's progress/physicians' notes, discharge summary, or other applicable medical record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a stabilized veteran who requires continued non-emergency treatment refuses to be transferred to an available VA facility (or other Federal facility that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services for veterans), VA will make payment or reimbursement only for the expenses related to the initial evaluation and the emergency treatment furnished to the veteran up to the point of refusal of transfer by the veteran.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an eligible veteran under Sec.  17.1002 has contractual or legal recourse against a third party that would only partially extinguish the veteran's

liability to the provider of emergency treatment, then:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA will be the secondary payer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to the limitations of this section, VA will pay the difference between the amount VA would have paid under this section for the cost of the emergency treatment and the amount paid (or payable) by the third party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provider will consider the combined payment under paragraph (e)(2) of this section as payment in full and extinguish the veteran's liability to the provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> VA will not reimburse a claimant under this section for any deductible, copayment or similar payment that the veteran owes the third party.
