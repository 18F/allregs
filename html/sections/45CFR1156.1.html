The Age Discrimination Act  of 1975, as amended, is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis  of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.  The Act also permits federally assisted programs or activities, and  recipients of Federal funds to continue to use certain age distinctions  and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and  the regulations in this part.
