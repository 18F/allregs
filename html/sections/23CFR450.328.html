                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FHWA and the FTA shall jointly find that each metropolitan TIP is consistent with the metropolitan transportation plan produced by the continuing and comprehensive transportation process carried on cooperatively by the MPO(s), the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303. This finding shall be based on the self-certification statement submitted by the State and MPO under Sec. 450.334, a review of the metropolitan transportation plan by the FHWA and the FTA, and upon other reviews as deemed necessary by the FHWA and the FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, shall determine conformity of any updated or amended TIP, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93. After the FHWA and the FTA issue a conformity determination on the TIP, the TIP shall be incorporated, without change, into the STIP, directly or by reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the metropolitan transportation plan has not been updated in accordance with the cycles defined in Sec. 450.322(c), projects may only be advanced from a TIP that was approved and found to conform (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) prior to expiration of the metropolitan transportation plan and meets the TIP update requirements of Sec. 450.324(a). Until the MPO approves (in attainment areas) or the FHWA/FTA issues a conformity determination on (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) the updated metropolitan transportation plan, the TIP may not be amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of extenuating circumstances, the FHWA and the FTA will consider and take appropriate action on requests to extend the STIP approval period for all or part of the TIP in accordance with Sec. 450.218(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an illustrative project is included in the TIP, no Federal action may be taken on that project by the FHWA and the FTA until it is formally included in the financially constrained and conforming metropolitan transportation plan and TIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where necessary in order to maintain or establish operations, the FHWA and the FTA may approve highway and transit operating assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects or programs may not be included in an approved TIP.</p>
