insured as a compensationer on or after April 24, 1999, must choose the level of post-age-65 reduction he or she wants. There are two choices: Full Reduction and No Reduction. The election may be made only by the employee and must be made in the manner that OPM designates. The employee may make different elections for Option B and for Option C. He or she may choose Full Reduction for some multiples of an Option and No Reduction for other multiples of the same Option. Failure to make an election for Option B or for Option C will be considered to be an election of Full Reduction for all multiples of that Option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of this part, a judge who retires under one of the provisions listed in Sec. 870.703(e)(1) is considered to be an employee after retirement.

Exception: If the judge is eligible for compensation and chooses to receive compensation instead of annuity, the post-65 reductions and elections apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Prior to reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer can change from No Reduction to Full Reduction at any time.

Exception: If the individual has assigned his or her insurance as provided in subpart I of this part, only the assignee can change from No Reduction to Full Reduction for the Option B coverage. If an individual age 65 or over changes to Full Reduction, the amount of insurance in force is computed as if he or she had elected Full Reduction initially. There is no refund of premiums.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer can change from No Reduction to Full Reduction at any time.
