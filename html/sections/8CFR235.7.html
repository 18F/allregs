                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> PORTPASS Program--(1) Definitions--(i) Port Passenger Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS). A system in which certain ports-of-entry (POEs) are identified and designated by the Service as providing access to the United States for a group of identified, low-risk, border crossers. Alien participants in the PORTPASS program are personally inspected, identified, and screened in advance of approval for participation in the program by an immigration officer, and may apply to enter the United States through a dedicated commuter lane (DCL) or through an automated permit port (APP). Such advance inspection and identification, when the enrolled participant satisfies the conditions and requirements set fourth in this section, satisfies the reporting requirements of Sec. 235.1(a). Each successful use of PORTPASS constitutes a separate and completed inspection and application for entry by the alien program participants on the date PORTPASS is used. United States citizens who meet the eligibility requirements for participation are subject to all rules, procedures, and conditions for use set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions--(i) Port Passenger Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS).

A POE designated by the Service to provide access to the United States by an identified, low-risk, border crosser through the use of automation when the POE is not staffed. An APP has limited hours of operation and is located at a remote location on a land border. This program is limited to the northern border of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dedicated Commuter Lane (DCL). A special lane set apart from the normal flow of traffic at a land border POE which allows an accelerated inspection for identified, low-risk travelers. This program is limited to the northern border of the United States and the California-Mexico border.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> DCL system costs fee. A fee charged to a participant to cover the

cost of the implementation and operation of the PORTPASS system. If a participant wishes to enroll more than one vehicle for use in the PORTPASS system, he or she will be assessed an additional vehicle fee for each additional vehicle enrolled. Regardless of when the additional vehicle is enrolled, the expiration date for use of that vehicle in the DCL will be the same date that the respective participant's authorized use of the lane expires, or is otherwise revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designation of POEs for PORTPASS access. The following criteria shall be used by the Service in the selection of a POE when classifying the POE as having PORTPASS access:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The location has an identifiable group of low-risk border crossers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The institution of PORTPASS access will not significantly inhibit normal traffic flow;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The POE selected for access via a DCL has a sufficient number of Service personnel to perform primary and secondary inspection functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General eligibility requirements for PORTPASS program applicants.

Applicants must agree to furnish all information requested on the application, and must agree to terms set forth for use of the PORTPASS program. Use of the PORTPASS program constitutes application for entry into the United States. Criminal justice information databases will be checked to assist in determining the applicant's eligibility for the PORTPASS program at the time the Form I-823, Application--Alternative Inspection Services, is submitted. Criminal justice information on PORTPASS participants will be updated regularly, and the results will be checked electronically at the time of each approved participant's use of PORTPASS. Notwithstanding the provisions of 8 CFR part 264, fingerprints on Form FD-258 or in the manner prescribed by the Service may be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application.

This fee must be paid by the applicant to the Service before any processing of the application shall occur.

Evidence of valid, current registration and vehicle insurance must be presented to the Service at the time the vehicle is inspected. If the vehicle is not owned by the participant, the participant may be required to present written permission from the registered owner authorizing use of the vehicle in the PORTPASS program throughout the PORTPASS registration period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> An applicant, whether an occupant or driver, may apply to use more than one vehicle in the DCL. The first vehicle listed on the Form I-823 will be designated as the applicant's primary vehicle. The second vehicle, if not designated by another applicant as his or her primary vehicle, is subject to the additional vehicle charge as prescribed by the Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> An application may be denied in the discretion of the district director having jurisdiction over the POE where the applicant requests access. Notice of such denial shall be given to the applicant. There is no appeal from the denial, but denial is without prejudice to reapplying for this or any other Service benefit. Re-applications, or applications following revocation of permission to use the lane, will not be considered by the Service until 90 days have passed following the date of denial or revocation. Criteria which will be considered in the decision to approve or deny the application include the following: admissibility to the United States and documentation so evidencing, criminal history and/or evidence of criminality, purpose of travel, employment, residency, prior immigration history, possession of current driver's license, vehicle insurance and registration, and vehicle inspection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Applications approved by the Service will entitle the applicant to seek entry via a designated PORTPASS Program POE for a period of 2 years from the date of approval of the application unless approval is otherwise withdrawn. An application for a replacement card will not extend the initial period of approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> By applying for and participating in the PORTPASS program, each approved participant acknowledges and agrees to all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The installation and/or use of, in the vehicle approved for use in the PORTPASS program, any and all decals, devices, technology or other methodology deemed necessary by the Service to ensure inspection of the person(s) seeking entry through a DCL, in addition to any fee and/or monetary deposit assessed by the Service pending return of any and all such decals, devices, technology, and other methodology in undamaged condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That all devices, decals, or other equipment, methodology, or technology used to identify or inspect persons or vehicles seeking entry via any PORTPASS program remains the property of the United States Government at all times, and must be surrendered upon request by the Service.
