Persons seeking a waiver or reduction of fees may be required  to submit a written statement setting forth the intended purpose for  which the records are requested or otherwise indicate how disclosure  will primarily benefit the public and, in appropriate cases, explain why  the volume of records requested is necessary. Determinations made  pursuant to the authority set out herein are solely within the  discretion of the Chief, OSS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees and charges for services identified in the appendix to this  part shall be paid in full by the requester before the records are  delivered. Payment shall be made in U.S. funds by personal check, money  order, or bank draft made payable to the Library of Congress.
