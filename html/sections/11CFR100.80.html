                            <p class="depth0">The payment by a State or local committee of a political party of  the costs of preparation, display, or mailing or other distribution  incurred by such committee with respect to a printed slate card, sample  ballot, palm card, or other printed listing(s) of three or more  candidates for any public office for which an election is held in the  State in which the committee is organized is not a contribution. The  payment of the portion of such costs allocable to Federal candidates  must be made from funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of  the Act. If made by a political committee, such payments shall be  reported by that committee as disbursements, but need not be allocated  in committee reports to specific candidates. This exemption shall not  apply to costs incurred by such a committee with respect to the  preparation and display of listings made on broadcasting stations, or in  newspapers, magazines, and similar types of general public political  advertising such as billboards. But see 11 CFR 100.24, 104.17(a) and  part 300, subpart B for exempt activities that also constitute Federal  election activity.</p>
