                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A preformed (polymerized) absorbable lung biopsy  plug is intended to provide accuracy in marking a biopsy location for  visualization during surgical resection and closure of pleural punctures  associated with percutaneous, transthoracic needle lung biopsies. Upon  deployment into the biopsy tract, the plug expands to fill the biopsy  void and remains in place until resorbed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special  controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design characteristics of the device must ensure that the  geometry and material composition are consistent with the intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance testing must demonstrate deployment as indicated in  the accompanying labeling, including the indicated introducer needles,  and demonstrate expansion and resorption characteristics in a clinically  relevant environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In vivo evaluation must demonstrate performance characteristics  of the device, including the ability of the plug to not prematurely  resorb or migrate and the rate of pneumothorax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sterility testing must demonstrate the sterility of the device  and the effects of the sterilization process on the physical  characteristics of the plug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Shelf-life testing must demonstrate the shelf-life of the device  including the physical characteristics of the plug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Labeling must include a detailed summary of the device-related  and procedure-related complications pertinent to the use of the device  and appropriate warnings. Labeling must include identification of  compatible introducer needles.  [79 FR 13219, Mar. 10, 2014]</p>
