                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required--(1) In general. Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation for each assessment period an assessment determined in accordance with this part 327.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation for each assessment period an assessment determined in accordance with this part 327.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of designated deposit account. For the purpose of making such payments, each insured depository institution shall designate a deposit account for direct debit by the Corporation. No later than 30 days prior to the next payment date specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each institution shall provide notice to the Corporation via FDICconnect of the account designated, including all information and authorizations needed by the Corporation for direct debit of the account.

After the initial notice of the designated account, no further notice is required unless the institution designates a different account for assessment debit by the Corporation, in which case the requirements of the preceding sentence apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transition Rule for Financing Corporation (FICO) Payments. Quarterly FICO payments shall be collected by the FDIC without interruption during the assessment system transitional period in 2007. All insured depository institutions shall make scheduled quarterly FICO payments on January 2, 2007 (unless prepaid on December 30, 2006), and March 30, 2007, based upon, respectively, their September 30, 2006, and December 31, 2006 reported assessment bases, which shall be the final assessment bases calculated pursuant to 12 CFR 327.5(a) and (b) (2006). Simultaneous collection of deposit insurance assessments and FICO assessments will resume in June of 2007, based on the March 31, 2007 reported assessment base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment payment--(1) Quarterly certified statement invoice. Starting with the first assessment period of 2007, no later than 15 days prior to the payment date specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Corporation will provide to each insured depository institution a quarterly certified statement invoice showing the amount of the assessment payment due from the institution for the prior quarter (net of credits or dividends, if any), and the computation of that amount. Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the invoiced amount on the quarterly certified statement invoice shall be the product of the following: the assessment base of the institution for the prior quarter computed in accordance with Sec. 327.5 multiplied by the institution's rate for that prior quarter as assigned to the institution pursuant to Sec. Sec. 327.4(a) and 327.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quarterly certified statement invoice. Starting with the first assessment period of 2007, no later than 15 days prior to the payment date specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Corporation will provide to each insured depository institution a quarterly certified statement invoice showing the amount of the assessment payment due from the institution for the prior quarter (net of credits or dividends, if any), and the computation of that amount. Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the invoiced amount on the quarterly certified statement invoice shall be the product of the following: the assessment base of the institution for the prior quarter computed in accordance with Sec. 327.5 multiplied by the institution's rate for that prior quarter as assigned to the institution pursuant to Sec. Sec. 327.4(a) and 327.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly payment date and manner. The Corporation will cause the amount stated in the applicable quarterly certified statement invoice to be directly debited on the appropriate payment date from the deposit account designated by the insured depository institution for that purpose, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of the assessment payment for the quarter that begins on January 1, the payment date is the following June 30;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of the assessment payment for the quarter that begins on April 1, the payment date is the following September 30;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of the assessment payment for the quarter that begins on July 1, the payment date is the following December 30; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of the assessment payment for the quarter that begins on October 1, the payment date is the following March 30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Necessary action, sufficient funding by institution. Each insured depository institution shall take all actions necessary to allow the Corporation to debit assessments from the insured depository institution's designated deposit account. Each insured depository institution shall, prior to each payment date indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, ensure that funds in an amount at least equal to the amount on the quarterly certified statement invoice are available in the designated account for direct debit by the Corporation. Failure to take any such action or to provide such funding of the account shall be deemed to constitute nonpayment of the assessment. Penalties for failure to timely pay assessments are provided for at 12 CFR 308.132(c)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Business days. If a payment date specified in paragraph (b)(2) falls on a date that is not a business day, the applicable date shall be the previous business day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment adjustments in succeeding quarters. Quarterly certified statement invoices provided by the Corporation may reflect adjustments, initiated by the Corporation or an institution, resulting from such factors as amendments to prior quarterly reports of condition, retroactive revision of the institution's assessment risk assignment, and revision of the Corporation's assessment computations for prior quarters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for revision of computation of quarterly assessment payment--(1) In general. An institution may submit a written request for revision of the computation of the institution's quarterly

assessment payment as shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An institution may submit a written request for revision of the computation of the institution's quarterly

assessment payment as shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The institution disagrees with the computation of the assessment base as stated on the quarterly certified statement invoice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The institution determines that the rate applied by the Corporation is inconsistent with the assessment risk assignment(s) provided to the institution in writing by the Corporation for the assessment period for which the payment is due; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The institution believes that the quarterly certified statement invoice does not fully or accurately reflect adjustments provided for in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inapplicability. This paragraph (f) is not applicable to requests for review of an institution's assessment risk assignment, which are covered by Sec. 327.4(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requirements. Any such request for revision must be submitted within 90 days from the date the computation being challenged appears on the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice. The request for revision shall be submitted to the Manager of the Assessments Section and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the change sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the request for additional information. Any institution submitting a timely request for revision will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding the outcome of its request. Upon completion of a review, the DOF Director (or designee) shall promptly notify the institution in writing of his or her determination of whether revision is warranted. If the institution requesting revision disagrees with that determination, it may appeal to the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals will be included with the written determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Quarterly certified statement invoice unavailable. Any institution whose quarterly certified statement invoice is unavailable on FDICconnect by the fifteenth day of the month in which the payment is due shall promptly notify the Corporation. Failure to provide prompt notice to the Corporation shall not affect the institution's obligation to make full and timely assessment payment. Unless otherwise directed by the Corporation, the institution shall preliminarily pay the amount shown on its quarterly certified statement invoice for the preceding assessment period, subject to subsequent correction.
