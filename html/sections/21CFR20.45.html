                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (1) through (3) of this  section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the  Food and Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of  these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the  reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec.  20.46 or for other reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use request. If the request is for a commercial use,  the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search,  review, and duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational and scientific institutions and news media. If the  request is from an educational institution or a   noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly  or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the  request is not for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration  will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and  Drug Administration will not charge the copying costs for the first 100  pages of duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other requests. If the request is not the kind described in  paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug  Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication.  Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the first 2  hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of  duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General provisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Food and Drug Administration may  charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure  or if no records are found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge  for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours are spent on a  computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the  operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than 2 hours on  the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly  rate for the operator's time, multiplied by 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section, there is  no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication, then those 100 pages  are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the  first 100 pages of computer printout. If this method to calculate the  fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be  reduced by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page,  multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and  processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the  fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or  together with others) is breaking down a single request into a series of  requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these  requests may be aggregated for purposes of calculating the fees charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st  day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions in 45 CFR part 30,  the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims  collection, will be used in assessing interest, administrative costs,  and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee schedule. The Food and Drug Administration charges the  following fees in accordance with the regulations of the Department of  Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual searching for or reviewing of records. When the search or  review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly  rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS- 9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4,  employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the  salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will  be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade  and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding  to the nearest whole dollar. When a search involves employees at more  than one of these levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge  the rate appropriate for each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computer searching and printing. The actual cost of operating  the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the  rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Photocopying standard size pages. $0.10 per page. Freedom of  Information Officers may charge lower fees for particular documents  where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The document has already been printed in large numbers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The program office determines that using existing stock to  answer this request, and any other anticipated Freedom of Information  requests, will not interfere with program requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Freedom of Information Officer determines that the lower  fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing  costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or  blueprints), or reproducing other records (such as tapes).   The actual costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the  materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the  rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Certifying that records are true copies. This service is not  required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug  Administration agrees to provide certification, there is a $10 charge  per certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sending records by express mail or other special methods. This  service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food  and Drug Administration agrees to provide this service, the requester  will be required to directly pay, or be directly charged by, the  courier. The agency will not agree to any special delivery method that  does not permit the requester to directly pay or be directly charged for  the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Performing any other special service in connection with a  request to which the Food and Drug Administration has agreed. Actual  costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials  used, plus charges for the time of the Food and Drug Administration's  employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for assessing and collecting fees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agreement to  pay. The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester  is willing to pay the fees charged for services associated with the  request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If  it appears that the fees will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug  Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to  proceed with the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advance payment. If a requester has failed to pay previous bills  in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial  review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the  requester will be required to pay past due fees and/or the estimated  fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins.  In such cases, the requester will be notified promptly upon receipt of  the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in Sec.  20.41 will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester  over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or reduction is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Billing and payment. Ordinarily, the requester will be required  to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the  records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send  the requester a bill along with or following the records. For example,  the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a  history of prompt payment. The Food and Drug Administration may also, at  its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order  to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to  businesses or agents representing requesters. For example, the Food and  Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month.  Fees should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the  person who responds to the request.  [59 FR 533, Jan. 5, 1994. Redesignated and amended at 68 FR 25286, May  12, 2003]</p>
