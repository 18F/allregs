The GSA regulation 41 CFR 101-44.207(a) (3) through (27), describes specific Federal

financial assistance which provides assistance to all age groups. However, the Child Care Center Program servicing children through age 14, and ``Programs for Older Individuals'', are the only two types of Federal financial assistance where age distinctions are provided.</p>
