If a sea turtle is observed to be hooked or entangled in fishing gear from any vessel fishing under the Pelagics FEP, vessel owners and operators must use the required mitigation gear set forth in paragraph (a) of this section to comply with these handling requirements. Any hooked or entangled sea turtle must be handled in a manner to minimize injury and promote survival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sea turtles that cannot be brought aboard. In instances where a sea turtle is too large to be brought aboard or the sea turtle cannot be brought aboard without causing further injury to the sea turtle, the vessel owner or operator must disentangle and remove the gear, or cut the line as close as possible to the hook or entanglement, to remove the maximum amount of the gear from the sea turtle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sea turtles that can be brought aboard. In instances where a sea turtle is not too large to be brought aboard, or the sea turtle can be brought aboard without causing further injury to the turtle, the vessel owner or operator must take the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Immediately bring the sea turtle aboard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Handle the sea turtle in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disentangle and remove the gear, or cut the line as close as possible to the hook or entanglement, to remove the maximum amount of the gear from the sea turtle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sea turtle resuscitation. If a sea turtle appears dead or comatose, the following actions must be taken:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Place the sea turtle on its belly (on the bottom shell or plastron) so that the sea turtle is right side up and its hindquarters elevated at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) for a period of no less than 4 hours and no more than 24 hours. The amount of the elevation varies with the size of the sea turtle; greater elevations are needed for larger sea turtles;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Administer a reflex test at least once every 3 hours. The test is to be performed by gently touching the eye and pinching the tail of a sea turtle to determine if the sea turtle is responsive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Keep the sea turtle shaded and damp or moist (but under no circumstances place the sea turtle into a container holding water). A water-soaked towel placed over the eyes, carapace and flippers is the most effective method of keeping a sea turtle moist; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Return to the sea any sea turtle that revives and becomes active in the manner described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Sea turtles that fail to revive within the 24-hour period must also be returned to the sea in the manner described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sea turtle release. After handling a sea turtle in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the sea turtle must be returned to the ocean after identification unless NMFS requests the retention of a dead sea turtle for research. In releasing a sea turtle the vessel owner or operator must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Place the vessel engine in neutral gear so that the propeller is disengaged and the vessel is stopped, and release

the sea turtle away from deployed gear; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Observe that the turtle is safely away from the vessel before engaging the propeller and continuing operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other sea turtle requirements. No sea turtle, including a dead turtle, may be consumed or sold. A sea turtle may be landed, offloaded, transshipped or kept below deck only if NMFS requests the retention of a dead sea turtle for research.</p>
