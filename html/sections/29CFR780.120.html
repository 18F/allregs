                                Sec. 780.120  Raising of ``livestock.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The meaning of the term ``livestock'' as used in section 3(f) is  confined to the ordinary use of the word and includes only domestic  animals ordinarily raised or used on farms. That Congress did not use  this term in its generic sense is supported by the specific enumeration  of activities, such as the raising of fur-bearing animals, which would  be included in the generic meaning of the word. The term includes the  following animals, among others: Cattle (both dairy and beef cattle),  sheep, swine, horses, mules, donkeys, and goats. It does not include  such animals as albino and other rats, mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters,  which are ordinarily used by laboratories for research purposes  (Mitchell v. Maxfield, 12 WH Cases 792 (S.D. Ohio), 29 Labor Cases 68,  781). Fish are not ``livestock'' (Dunkly v. Erich, 158 F. 2d 1), but  employees employed in propagating or farming of fish may qualify for  exemption under section 13(a)(6) or 13(b)(12) of the Act as stated in  Sec. 780.109 as well as under section 13(a)(5), as explained in part  784 of this chapter.</p>
