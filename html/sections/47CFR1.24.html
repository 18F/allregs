Pending action by the General Counsel, the decision maker may proceed with the merits of the matter but in its decision may make findings concerning the attorney's conduct only if necessary to resolve questions concerning an applicant and may not reach any conclusions regarding the ethical ramifications of the attorney's conduct. The General Counsel will determine if the allegations are substantial, and, if so, shall immediately notify the attorney and direct him or her to respond to the allegations. No notice will be provided to other parties to the proceeding. The General Counsel will then determine what further measures are necessary to protect the integrity of the Commission's administrative process, including but not limited to one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recommending to the Commission the institution of a proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referring the matter to the appropriate State, territorial, or District of Columbia bar; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consulting with the Department of Justice.
