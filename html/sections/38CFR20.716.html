                            <p class="depth0">The tape recording on file at the Board of Veterans' Appeals or a transcript prepared by the Board of Veterans' Appeals is the only official record of a hearing before the Board. Alternate transcript versions prepared by the appellant and representative will not be accepted. If an appellant wishes to seek correction of perceived errors in a hearing transcript, the appellant or his or her representative should move for the correction of the hearing transcript within 30 days after the date that the transcript is mailed to the appellant. The motion must be in writing and must specify the error,

or errors, in the transcript and the correct wording to be substituted. In the case of hearings held before the Board of Veterans' Appeals, whether in Washington, DC, or in the field, the motion must be filed with the Director, Management and Administration (01E), Board of Veterans' Appeals, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. The ruling on the motion will be made by the presiding Member of the hearing.
