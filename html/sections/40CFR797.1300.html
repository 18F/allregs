                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures (``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes an acute toxicity test in which daphnids (Daphnia magna or D. pulex) are exposed to a chemical in static and flow-through systems. The United States Environmental Protection Agency will use data from this test in assessing the hazard a chemical may present in the aquatic environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and part 792--Good Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter apply to this test guideline. In addition, the following definitions apply to this guideline:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Brood stock means the animals which are cultured to produce test organisms through reproduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EC50 means that experimentally derived concentration of test substance in dilution water that is calculated to affect 50 percent of a test population during continuous exposure over a specified period of time. In this guideline, the effect measured is immobilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ephippium means a resting egg which develops under the carapace in response to stress conditions in daphnids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow-through means a continuous or an intermittent passage of test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or culture tank with no recycling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Immobilization means the lack of movement by the test organisms except for minor activity of the appendages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Loading means the ratio of daphnid biomass (grams, wet weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber at a point in time, or passing through the test chamber during a specific interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Static system means a test system in which the test solution and test organisms are placed in the test chamber and kept there for the duration of the test without renewal of the test solution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) Test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. In the flow-through test, the flow of dilution water through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. The test chemical is introduced into each treatment chamber. The addition of test chemical in the flow-through system is conducted at a rate which is sufficient to establish and maintain the desired concentration in the test chamber. The test is started within 30 minutes after the test chemical has been added and uniformly distributed in static test chambers or after the concentration of test chemical in each flow-through test chamber reaches the prescribed level and remains stable. At the initiation of the test, daphnids which have been cultured and acclimated in accordance with the test design are randomly placed into the test chambers. Daphnids in the test chambers are observed periodically during the test, the immobile daphnids removed, and the findings recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Summary of the test.

The exposure period may be shortened if data suitable for the purpose of the range-finding test can be obtained in less time. No replicates are required and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to determine the concentration-response curves and the 24- and 48-hour EC50 values with the minimum amount of testing beyond the range-finding test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The purpose of the definitive test is to determine the concentration-response curves and the 24- and 48-hour EC50 values with the minimum amount of testing beyond the range-finding test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A minimum of 20 daphnids per concentration shall be exposed to five or more concentrations of the chemical chosen in a geometric series in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 mg/l). An equal number of daphnids shall be placed in two or more replicates. If solvents, solubilizing agents or emulsifiers have to be used, they shall be commonly used carriers and shall not possess a synergistic or antagonistic effect on the toxicity of the test chemical. The concentration of solvent should not exceed 0.1 mg/l. The concentration ranges shall be selected to determine the concentration-response curves and EC50 values at 24 and 48 hours. Concentration of test chemical in test solutions should be analyzed prior to use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Every test shall include controls consisting of the same dilution water, conditions, procedures and daphnids

The test is unacceptable if more than 10 percent of the control organisms are immobilized during the 48-hour test period. Each test chamber shall be checked for immobilized daphnids at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning of the test. Concentration-response curves and 24-hour and 48-hour EC50 values for immobilization shall be determined along with their 95 percent confidence limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In addition to immobility, any abnormal behavior or appearance shall also be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing area shall be positioned in a random manner or in a way in which appropriate statistical analyses can be used to determine the variation due to placement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The concentration of the test chemical in the chambers should be measured as often as is feasible during the test. In the static test the concentration of test chemical shall be measured, at a minimum, at the beginning of the test and at the end of the test in each test chamber. In the flow-through test the concentration of test chemical shall be measured at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In each chamber at the beginning of the test and at 48 hours after the start of the test;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In at least one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is detected in any part of the test substance delivery system.

(i) Test chemical. Deionized water should be used in making stock solutions of the test chemical. Standard analytical methods should be used whenever available in performing the analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test chemical in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by appropriate laboratory practices. Any analytical method is not acceptable if likely degradation products of the test chemical, such as hydrolysis and oxidation products, give positive or negative interferences which cannot be systematically identified and corrected mathematically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test chemical.

(A) Materials and equipment that contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals from the dilution water and should not contain substances that can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect the test results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Materials and equipment that contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals from the dilution water and should not contain substances that can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect the test results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For static tests, daphnids can be conveniently exposed to the test chemical in 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For flow-through tests, daphnids can be exposed in glass or stainless steel containers with stainless steel or nylon screen bottoms. The containers should be suspended in the test chamber in such a manner to insure that the test solution flows regularly into and out of the container and that the daphnids are always submerged in at least 5 centimeters of test solution. Test chambers can be constructed using 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers equipped with screened overflow holes, standpipes or V-shaped notches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dilution water. (A) Surface or ground water, reconstituted water or dechlorinated tap water are acceptable as dilution water if daphnids will survive in it for the duration of the culturing, acclimation and testing periods without showing signs of stress. The quality of the dilution water should be constant and should meet the following specifications:

Reconstituted water can be made by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized or distilled water. Glass distilled or carbon-filtered deionized water with a conductivity less than 1 [micro]ohm/cm is acceptable as the diluent for making reconstituted water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cleaning. All test equipment and test chambers shall be cleaned before each use using standard laboratory procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests, proportional diluters, metering pump systems, or other suitable devices should be used to deliver test chemical to the test chambers. The system shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test chemical in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance delivery system should be checked twice during a test. The 24-hour flow through a test chamber shall be equal to at least 5 times the volume of the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not vary more than 10 percent from any one test chamber to another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test parameters.
