                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Only ``natural'' evergreens may comprise the principal part of the  wreath. The word ``natural'' qualifies all of the evergreens listed in  the section, including ``other evergreens.'' The term natural means that  the evergreens at the time they are being used in making a wreath must  be in the raw and natural state in which they have been harvested.  Artificial evergreens (Herring Magic v. U.S., 258 F. 2d 197; Cal.  Casualty Indemnity Exchange v. Industrial Accident Commission of Cal. 90  P. 2d 289) or evergreens which have been processed as by drying and  spraying with tinsel or by other means are not included. It is  immaterial whether the natural evergreen used in making a wreath has  been cultivated or is a product of the woods or forest.</p>
