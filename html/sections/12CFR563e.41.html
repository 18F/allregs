                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A savings association shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the OTS evaluates the savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The OTS does not evaluate the savings association's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the OTS reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose savings associations. The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose savings association must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the savings association has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Geographic area(s) for other savings associations. The assessment area(s) for a savings association other than a wholesale or limited purpose savings association must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include the geographies in which the savings association has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking ATMs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the savings association has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the savings association chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the savings association elects to have its performance assessed).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments to geographic area(s). A savings association may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area. Each savings association's assessment area(s):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must consist only of whole geographies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May not reflect illegal discrimination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account the savings association's size and financial condition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond a state boundary, the savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond an MSA boundary, the savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the MSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Savings associations serving military personnel. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a savings association whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit customer base as its assessment area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use of assessment area(s). The OTS uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a savings association in its evaluation of the savings association's CRA performance unless the OTS determines that the assessment area(s) do

not comply with the requirements of this section.
