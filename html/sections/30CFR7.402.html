A bare or insulated wire or combination of wires not insulated from one another, suitable for carrying an electric current.</p><p class="depth0">Electric Cable. An assembly of one or more insulated conductors of electric current under a common or integral jacket. A cable may also contain one or more uninsulated conductors.</p><p class="depth0">Jacket. A nonmetallic abrasion-resistant outer covering of a cable or splice.</p><p class="depth0">Power Conductor. An insulated conductor of a cable assembly through which the primary electric current or power is transmitted.</p><p class="depth0">Signaling Cable. A fiber optic cable, or a cable containing electric conductors of a cross-sectional area less than 14 AWG used where the circuit cannot deliver currents which would increase conductor temperatures beyond that established for the current-carrying capacity of the conductors.</p><p class="depth0">Splice. The mechanical joining of one or more severed conductors in a single length of a cable including the replacement of insulation and jacket.</p><p class="depth0">Splice Kit.
