A repair program means the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts  that are contemplated in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed  $25,000, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward  the request, together with the loan guaranty folder, to the Under  Secretary for Benefits for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During the period when VA has assumed custody of the property  from a holder and before its conveyance to VA under 38 CFR 36.4320,  repairs not in excess of $3,500 are authorized, when appropriate to make  the property ready for sale at an earlier date than would otherwise be  possible if the repair program was delayed until VA acquired absolute  title. In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed  $3,500, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward  the request, together with the loan guarantee folder, to the Under  Secretary for Benefits for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The holder must not make repairs to a property when it has  continued custody, except for emergency repairs not in excess of $500,  unless the holder gives adequate notice to the Director, Regional  Office. Emergency repairs means immediate action to preserve the  property from serious damage or to correct a situation imminently  dangerous to life or limb, including the initial cleanup of the property  to prevent the risk of damage by fire or vandalism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An approved management broker may be authorized, when the  property is assigned, to incur expenses for fuel and utilities or other  recurring items that VA is required to furnish to its tenants or are  required to maintain the property if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance blanket authorization to a management broker must be  limited to repairs not in excess of $500 in any transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The management broker must either submit receipts with an  invoice or maintain receipts for inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenditures in excess of $500 require prior approval of the  Director, Regional Office, having jurisdiction of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The management broker must aggregate the costs of repairs when  determining whether prior approval is required.</p>
