                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before you receive a shipment of household goods you will move for an individual shipper, you must prepare an order for service. The order for service must contain the information described in the following 15 items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your name and address and the FMCSA U.S. DOT number assigned to the mover who is responsible for performing the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual shipper's name, address, and, if available, telephone number(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the delivering mover's office or agent located at or nearest to the destination of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A telephone number where the individual shipper/consignee may contact you or your designated agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> One of the following three entries must be on the order for service:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agreed pickup date and agreed delivery date of the move.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agreed period(s) of the entire move.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you are transporting the shipment on a guaranteed service basis, the guaranteed dates or periods for pickup, transportation, and delivery. You must enter any penalty or per diem requirements upon the agreement under this item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The names and addresses of any other motor carriers, when known, who will participate in interline transportation of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The form of payment you and your agents will honor at delivery. The payment information must be the same that was entered on the estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The terms and conditions for payment of the total charges, including notice of any minimum charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The maximum amount you will demand at the time of delivery to obtain possession of the shipment, when you transport on a collect-on-delivery basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A statement of the declared value of the shipment, which is the maximum amount of your liability to the individual shipper under your Full Value Protection for the replacement value of any household goods that are lost, damaged, destroyed, or otherwise not delivered to the final destination. If the individual shipper waives, in writing, your Full Value Protection liability, you must include a copy of the waiver; the Surface Transportation Board's required released rates valuation statement; and the charges, if any, for optional valuation coverage (other than Full Value Protection). The released rates may be increased annually by the motor carrier based on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A complete description of any special or accessorial services ordered and minimum weight or volume charges applicable to the shipment, subject to the following two conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you provide service for individual shippers on rates based upon the transportation of a minimum weight or volume, you must indicate on the order for service the minimum weight- or volume-based rates, and the minimum charges applicable to the shipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you do not indicate the minimum rates and charges, your tariff must provide you will compute the final charges relating to such a shipment based upon the actual weight or volume of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Any identification or registration number you assign to the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> For non-binding estimates, your reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of the charges, the method of payment of total charges, and the maximum amount (no more than 110 percent of the non-binding estimate) you will demand at the time of delivery to relinquish possession of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> For binding estimates, the amount of charges you will demand based upon the binding estimate and the terms of payment under this estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Whether the individual shipper requests notification of the charges before delivery. The individual shipper must provide you with the fax number(s) or address(es) where you will transmit the notifications by fax transmission; e-mail; overnight courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You, your agent, or your driver must inform the individual shipper if you reasonably expect a special or accessorial service is necessary to safely transport a shipment.

You must make a written note if the shipper refuses any special or accessorial services that you reasonably expect to be necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You and the individual shipper must sign the order for service. You must provide a dated copy of the order for service to the individual shipper at the time you sign the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> You may provide the individual shipper with blank or incomplete estimates, orders for service, bills of lading, or any other blank or incomplete documents pertaining to the move.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may provide the individual shipper with blank or incomplete estimates, orders for service, bills of lading, or any other blank or incomplete documents pertaining to the move.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may require the individual shipper to sign an incomplete document at origin provided it contains all relevant shipping information except the actual shipment weight and any other information necessary to determine the final charges for all services performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must provide the individual shipper the opportunity to rescind the order for service without any penalty for a three-day period after the shipper signs the order for service, if the shipper scheduled the shipment to be loaded more than three days after signing the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Before loading the shipment, and upon mutual agreement of both you and the individual shipper, you may amend an order for service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must retain a copy of the order for service for each move you perform for at least one year from the date you made the order for service and keep it as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You must place the valuation statement on the bill of lading.
