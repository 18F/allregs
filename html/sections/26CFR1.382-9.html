                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)(A))</em> if the transaction resulting in the  ownership change is ordered by the court or is pursuant to a plan  approved by the court. Terms and nomenclature used in this section, and  not otherwise defined herein (including the nomenclature and assumptions  in Sec. 1.382-2T(b) relating to the examples) have the same respective  meanings as in section 382 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of section 382(l)(5). section 382(a) does not apply  to any ownership change if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The old loss corporation is (immediately before the ownership  change) under the jurisdiction of the court in a title 11 or similar  case; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (determined by substituting ``50 percent'' for ``80  percent'' each place it appears).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, ownership of stock  after the ownership change is determined without applying the  attribution rules generally applicable under section 382(l)(3)(A) or  Sec. 1.382-2T(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rules for determining whether indebtedness is qualified  indebtedness--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. Indebtedness of the loss corporation is  qualified indebtedness if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has been owned by the same beneficial owner since the date that  is 18 months before the date of the filing of the title 11 or similar  case; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Arose in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the  loss corporation and has been owned at all times by the same beneficial  owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of beneficial ownership. For purposes of  paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, beneficial ownership of  indebtedness is determined without applying attribution rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duty of inquiry. The loss corporation must determine that  indebtedness that the loss corporation treats as qualified indebtedness,  other than indebtedness to which paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section  applies, has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner  who owns the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change. The  loss corporation may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of  perjury, by a beneficial owner regarding the amount of indebtedness the  beneficial owner owns and the length of time that the beneficial owner  has owned the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ordinary course indebtedness. For purposes of this paragraph  (d)(2), indebtedness arises in the ordinary course of the loss  corporation's trade or business only if the indebtedness is incurred by  the loss corporation in connection with the normal, usual, or customary  conduct of business, determined without regard to whether the  indebtedness funds ordinary or capital expenditures of the loss  corporation. For example, indebtedness (other than indebtedness acquired  for a principal purpose of being exchanged for stock) arises in the  ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if it is  trade debt; a tax liability; a liability arising from a past or present  employment relationship, a past or present business relationship with a  supplier, customer, or competitor of the loss corporation, a tort, a  breach of warranty, or a breach of statutory duty; or indebtedness  incurred to pay an expense deductible under section 162 or included in  the cost of goods sold. A claim that arises upon the rejection of a  burdensome contract or lease pursuant to the title 11 or similar case is  treated as arising in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's  trade or business if the contract or lease so arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> does not  apply to indebtedness beneficially owned by a person whose participation  in formulating a plan of reorganization makes evident to the loss  corporation (whether or not the loss corporation had previous knowledge)  that the person has not owned the indebtedness for the requisite period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Operating rules. For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this  section: (A) If   a loss corporation has actual knowledge of a coordinated acquisition of  its indebtedness by a group of persons, through a formal or informal  understanding among themselves, for a principal purpose of exchanging  the indebtedness for stock, the indebtedness (and any stock received in  exchange therefor) is treated as owned by an entity. A principal element  in determining if an understanding exists among members of a group is  whether the investment decision of each member is based upon the  investment decision of one or more other members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the loss corporation has actual knowledge regarding stock  ownership described in Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must  take that ownership into account in determining which beneficial owners  of indebtedness are, immediately after the ownership change, 5-percent  shareholders or 5-percent entities. The loss corporation is not required  to take into account an ownership interest described in Sec. 1.382- 2T(k)(4) unless the loss corporation has actual knowledge of the  ownership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The term 5-percent shareholder includes any person who is a 5- percent shareholder of the loss corporation within the meaning of Sec.  1.382-2T(g), without regard to the option attribution rules of section  382(l)(3)(A) or Sec. 1.382-4(d) (or, if applicable, Sec. 1.382- 2T(h)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indebtedness owned by beneficial owner who becomes a 5-percent  shareholder or 5-percent entity. If the beneficial owner of indebtedness  immediately before the ownership change is a 5-percent shareholder or 5- percent entity immediately after the ownership change, the general rules  of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to determine whether the  indebtedness has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial  owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates paragraph (d)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan  of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the  satisfaction of claims by the issuance of new L common stock to its  creditors as follows:  A--2 percent B--7.5 percent C--2.5 percent P1--3 percent P2--10 percent P3--4.9 percent P4--4.9 percent P5--4.9 percent</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> P2 is owned by Public P2. B owns 10 percent of the stock of P1  and L has no actual knowledge of this ownership. L has actual knowledge  that D owns P3, P4 and P5. In addition, L has actual knowledge,  immediately after the ownership change, that C owns an option to acquire  newly-issued stock of L that, if exercised, would increase C's  percentage ownership of L stock from 2.5 percent to 8 percent. An  ownership change of L occurs on the date the plan becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, L may treat the  indebtedness owned by A and P1 immediately before the ownership change  as always having been owned by A and P1. Neither A nor P1 is a 5-percent  shareholder immediately after the ownership change. Further, because P1  owns less than 5 percent of the L stock (and L has no actual knowledge  of B's ownership interest in P1), P1 is treated as an individual, and  the L stock owned by P1 is not attributed to any other person, including  B. See Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii). Therefore, P1 is not a 5-percent  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the  indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, or P5. B is a 5-percent  shareholder immediately after the ownership change. L has actual  knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of  C's option would cause C to be a 5-percent shareholder immediately after  the ownership change. (L does not take into account the effect of the  exercise of the option, however, in determining the percentage stock  ownership of any person other than C because the deemed exercise would  not cause any other person to be a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent  entity after the ownership change.) P2 is a 5-percent entity, because  Public P2, a   5-percent shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through  P2. P3, P4, and P5 are 5-percent entities because D, a 5-percent  shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P3, P4,  and P5. Because L has actual knowledge that D would be a 5-percent  shareholder but for the application of Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii), that  section does not apply to P3, P4, or P5. See Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(2). Thus,  under Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i), the L stock owned by P3, P4, and P5 is  attributed to D, and D is a 5-percent shareholder. Because paragraph  (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B,  C, P2, P3, P4, and P5, L may treat as qualified indebtedness only  indebtedness that it determines had been owned by such persons for the  requisite period. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule if indebtedness is a large portion of creditor's  assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Indebtedness is not qualified indebtedness if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The beneficial owner of the indebtedness is a corporation or  other entity that had an ownership change on any day during the  applicable period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The indebtedness represents more than 25 percent of the fair  market value of the total gross assets (excluding cash or cash  equivalents) of the beneficial owner on its change date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The beneficial owner is a 5-percent entity immediately after the  ownership change of the loss corporation (determined by applying the  rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable period. For purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this  section, the term applicable period means the period beginning on the  day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or similar case (or the  day on which the beneficial owner acquired the indebtedness, if later)  and ending with the change date of the loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of ownership change. For purposes of paragraph  (d)(4)(i) of this section, the determination whether a beneficial owner  of indebtedness has an ownership change is made under the principles of  section 382 and the regulations thereunder, without regard to whether  the beneficial owner is a loss corporation and by beginning the testing  period no earlier than the latest of the day three years before the  change date, the day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or  similar case, or the day on which the beneficial owner acquired the  indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reliance on statement. Paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does  not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation obtains a statement,  signed under penalties of perjury, by the beneficial owner of the  indebtedness that states that paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does  not apply to the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tacking of ownership periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transferee treated as owning  indebtedness for period owned by transferor. To determine whether  indebtedness transferred in a qualified transfer is qualified  indebtedness, the transferee is treated as having owned the indebtedness  for the period that it was owned by the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified transfer. For purposes of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this  section, a transfer of indebtedness is a qualified transfer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transfer is between parties who bear a relationship to each  other described in section 267(b) or 707(b) (substituting at least 80  percent for more than 50 percent each place it appears in section 267(b)  (and section 267(f)(1)) or 707(b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The transfer is a transfer of a loan within 90 days after its  origination, pursuant to a customary syndication transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The transfer is a transfer of newly incurred indebtedness by an  underwriter that owned the indebtedness for a transitory period pursuant  to an underwriting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The transferee's basis in the indebtedness is determined under  section 1014 or 1015 or with reference to the transferor's basis in the  indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The transfer is in satisfaction of a right to receive a  pecuniary bequest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The transfer is pursuant to any divorce or separation instrument  (within the meaning of section 71(b)(2));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The transfer is pursuant to a subrogation in which the  transferee acquires a claim against the loss corporation by reason of a  payment to the claimant pursuant to an insurance policy or a guarantee,  letter of credit or similar security arrangement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The transfer is a transfer of an account receivable in a  customary commercial factoring transaction   made within 30 days after the account arose to a transferee that  regularly engages in such transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception. A transfer of indebtedness is not a qualified  transfer for purposes of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section if the  transferee acquired the indebtedness for a principal purpose of  benefiting from the losses of the loss corporation by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exchanging the indebtedness for stock of the loss corporation  pursuant to the title 11 or similar case; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Selling the indebtedness at a profit that reflects the  expectation that, by reason of section 382(l)(5), section 382(a) will  not apply to any ownership change resulting from the title 11 or similar  case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Debt-for-debt exchanges. If the loss corporation satisfies its  indebtedness with new indebtedness, either through an exchange of new  indebtedness for old indebtedness or a change in the terms of  indebtedness that results in an exchange under section 1001--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner of the new indebtedness is treated as having owned  that indebtedness for the period that it owned the old indebtedness; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The new indebtedness is treated as having arisen in the ordinary  course of the trade or business of the loss corporation if the old  indebtedness so arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (d) applies to  ownership changes occurring on or after March 17, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elections and amended returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Election to apply this  paragraph (d) retroactively. A loss corporation may elect to apply this  paragraph (d) to an ownership change occurring prior to March 17, 1994.  This election must be made by the later of the due date (including any  extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return for the taxable  year which includes the change date or the date that the loss  corporation files its first tax return after May 16, 1994. The election  is made by attaching the following statement to the return: ``This is an  Election to Apply Sec. 1.382-9(d) Retroactively with Respect to the  Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in  Connection with the title 11 or Similar Case filed on [Insert Date of  Filing].'' This statement must be accompanied by the amended returns  described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section. An election under  this paragraph (d)(6) is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Election to revoke section 382(l)(5)(H) election. A loss  corporation may elect to revoke a prior election made under section  382(l)(5)(H) with respect to an ownership change occurring before March  17, 1994 by including the following statement with its election to apply  Sec. 1.382-9(d) retroactively: ``This is an Election to Revoke a Prior  Election Made Under Section 382(l)(5)(H) With Respect to the Ownership  Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in Connection  With the title 11 or Similar Case Filed on [Insert Date of Filing].''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amended returns. If the retroactive application of this  paragraph (d) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior  taxable year, then, except as precluded by the applicable statute of  limitations, the loss corporation (or the common parent of any  consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the  year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effects  of the retroactive application of the rules of this paragraph (d). If  the statute of limitations precludes the filing of an amended return for  one or more such prior taxable years, the loss corporation (or the  common parent) must make appropriate adjustments under the principles of  section 382(l)(2)(A) in subsequent taxable years to reflect the  difference between the losses and credits actually used in such prior  taxable years and the amount that would have been used in those years  applying the rules of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, rules similar to those option attribution rules under Sec.  1.382-2T(h)(4)(iii), (iv), (v), (vii), and (x)(A), (B) (except with  respect to a debt instrument that was issued after the filing of the  petition in the title 11 or similar case), (D), (E) (except with respect  to a right to receive or obligation to issue stock as interest or  dividends on a debt instrument or stock that was issued after the filing  of the petition in the title 11 or similar case), (G), (H), and (Z),  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lapse or forfeiture of options deemed  exercised. A loss corporation may apply rules similar to the rules of  Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4)(viii) with respect to an option except to the  extent any person owning the option at any time on or after the change  date acquires additional stock or an option to acquire additional stock  during the period of time on or after the ownership change and on or  before the lapse or forfeiture of the option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> applies only if the option is actually exercised  within the 3 years of the ownership change by the 5-percent shareholder  who, as a result of being a pre-change shareholder or qualified  creditor, acquired the option under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amended returns. A loss corporation may file an amended return  for a prior taxable year (subject to any applicable statute of  limitations) if it determines that section 382(l)(5) applies to an  ownership change as a result of the operation of paragraph (e)(2)(i) or  (ii) of this section, but only if the loss corporation makes  corresponding adjustments on amended returns for all affected taxable  years (subject to any applicable statute of limitations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>,  assume that there is an ownership change of loss corporation L on the  date the plan of reorganization is effective.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of  reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the  cancellation of all existing L stock, the issuance of 100 shares of new  L common stock to qualified creditors, and the issuance of an option to  a new investor to acquire, at any time during the next 3 years, 90  shares of new L common stock from L at its fair market value on the date  the plan becomes effective. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, on  the date the plan becomes effective, the option held by the new investor  is deemed exercised if the exercise would cause the qualified creditors  of L to own less than 50 percent of the total voting power or value of  the L stock after the ownership change. Because the qualified creditors  would receive at least 50 percent of the voting power and value of the  new L common stock even if the option were deemed exercised, the stock  ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that L  issues an option to the new investor to acquire 110 shares of new L  common stock. This option is deemed exercised under paragraph (e)(1) of  this section on the date the plan becomes effective, because, as a  result of the deemed exercise, the qualified creditors would own only  100 of 210 shares of the new L common stock (approximately 48 percent)  after the ownership change. Accordingly, the stock ownership  requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are not satisfied and section  382(a) applies to the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan  of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the  cancellation of all existing L stock, the issuance of new L common stock  and 5-year options to acquire L common stock as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To qualified creditors--100 shares of stock and options to  acquire 50 shares;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To a new investor--options to acquire 110 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the option held by the  new investor is deemed exercised on the date the plan becomes effective  because the exercise would cause the qualified creditors of L to own  less than 50 percent of the total voting power and value of the L stock  after the ownership change (100 of 210 shares or approximately 48  percent). Accordingly, the stock ownership requirements of section  382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are not satisfied initially and section 382(a) applies  to the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assume, however, that the qualified creditors actually exercise  enough options that were acquired pursuant to the plan of reorganization  to purchase 30 additional shares during the 3 year period after the plan  becomes effective. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, L may  take into account the 30 shares purchased by the qualified creditors by  the exercise of the options in determining whether the stock ownership  requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) were satisfied on the date the  plan of reorganization became effective. If L takes such purchases into  account, the qualified creditors of L are deemed to own as of the date  of the ownership change more than 50 percent of the total voting power  or value of the L stock after the ownership change (130 of 240 shares or  approximately 54 percent), with the result that the stock ownership  requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied and section  382(l)(5) applies to the ownership change as of the effective date of  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assume instead that the qualified creditors acquire 30  additional shares by exercise of options more than 3 years after the  plan becomes effective. Such exercise is not taken into account under  paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section for purposes of determining whether  the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are  satisfied as of the effective date of the plan. Thus, the qualified  creditors are deemed to own less than 50 percent of the total voting  power and value of the L stock after the ownership change (100 of 210  shares) and section 382(l)(5) does not apply to the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)(ii)</em> of this section, L may take into  account the 6 shares purchased by the qualified creditors by the  exercise of the options in determining whether the stock ownership  requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied as of the  effective date of the plan. If L takes all of this information into  account, the qualified creditors are deemed to own more than 50 percent  of the total voting power or value of the L stock after the ownership  change (106 of 211 shares or approximately 50.2 percent) and section  382(l)(5) applies to the ownership change as of the effective date of  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (e) applies to  ownership changes occurring on or after September 5, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for interest or dividends. Rules similar to the  rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4)(x)(E) (relating to option attribution for  purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs) apply to a  right to receive or obligation to issue stock as interest or dividends  on a debt instrument or stock that was issued after the filing of the  petition in the title 11 or similar case for ownership changes occurring  before April 8, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)-(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> not to Apply the Provisions of Section 382(l)(5) to the  Ownership Change Occurring Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization  Confirmed by the Court on [Insert Confirmation Date].''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Value of the loss corporation in an ownership change to which  section 382(l)(6) applies. Section 382(l)(6) applies to any ownership  change occurring pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or  similar case to which section 382(l)(5) does not apply. In such case,  the value of the loss corporation   under section 382(e) is equal to the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of the stock of the loss corporation immediately after  the ownership change (determined under the rules of paragraph (k) of  this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets  (determined under the rules of paragraph (l) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Rules for determining the value of the stock of the loss  corporation--(1) Certain ownership interests treated as stock. For  purposes of paragraph (j)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and any  stock that is not treated as stock under Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) for  purposes of determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership  change; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stock does not include an ownership interest that is treated as  stock under Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(iii) for purposes of determining  whether a loss corporation has an ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>. If the loss corporation is  a foreign corporation, in determining the value of the stock under  paragraph (j)(1) of this section, only items treated as connected with  the conduct of a trade or business in the United States are taken into  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination with section 382(l)(1). Section 382(l)(1) does not  apply in determining the value of the stock of the loss corporation  under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coordination with section 382(l)(4). If, immediately after the  ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness  assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) taking into account  only those assets the loss corporation held immediately before the  ownership change), the value of the stock of the loss corporation under  paragraph (j)(1) of this section is reduced by the excess of the value  of such nonbusiness assets over those assets' share of the loss  corporation's indebtedness (determined under section 382(l)(4)(D) taking  into account the loss corporation's assets and liabilities immediately  after the ownership change).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for stock not subject to the risk of corporate  business operations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The value of the stock of the loss  corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is reduced by the  value of stock that is issued as part of a plan one of the principal  purposes of which is to increase the section 382 limitation without  subjecting the investment to the entrepreneurial risks of corporate  business operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coordination of special rule and other rules affecting value.  If the value of the loss corporation is modified under another rule  affecting value, appropriate adjustments are to be made so that such  modification is not duplicated under this paragraph (k)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Limitation on value of stock. For purposes of paragraph (j)(1)  of this section, the value of stock of the loss corporation issued in  connection with the ownership change cannot exceed the cash and the  value of any property (including indebtedness of the loss corporation)  received by the loss corporation in consideration for the issuance of  that stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Rules for determining the value of the loss corporation's pre- change assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

If the loss corporation is  a foreign corporation, in determining the value of the pre-change assets  under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, only assets treated as connected  with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States are taken  into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, the receipt of cash or property by the loss corporation in  exchange for the issuance of indebtedness is considered a capital  contribution if it is part of a plan one of the principal purposes of  which is to increase the value of the loss corporation under paragraph  (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coordination with section 382(l)(4). If, immediately after the  ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness  assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) taking into account  only those assets the loss corporation held immediately before the  ownership change), the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets  is reduced by the value of the nonbusiness assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Continuity of business requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under section 382(l)(5).  If section 382(l)(5) applies to an ownership change of a loss  corporation, section 382(c) and the regulations thereunder do not apply  with respect to the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under section 382(l)(6). If section 382(l)(6) applies to an  ownership change of a loss corporation, section 382(c) and the  regulations thereunder apply to the ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Ownership change in a title 11 or similar case succeeded by  another ownership change within two years--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 382(l)(5) applies  to the first ownership change. If section 382(l)(5) applies to an  ownership change and, within the two-year period immediately following  such ownership change, a second ownership change occurs, section  382(l)(5) cannot apply to the second ownership change and the section  382(a) limitation with respect to the second ownership change is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 382(l)(6) applies to the first ownership change. If the  value of a loss corporation in an ownership change was determined under  section 382(l)(6) and a second ownership change occurs within the two- year period immediately following the first ownership change, the value  of the loss corporation under section 382(e) with respect to the second  ownership change is not reduced under section 382(l)(1) for any increase  in value of the loss corporation previously taken into account under  section 382(l)(6) with respect to the first ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Treatment of certain options for ownership change purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Neither Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4)(i) nor Sec. 1.382-4(d) (relating to the  treatment of options as exercised) applies to the following options to  acquire stock of a loss corporation reorganized pursuant to a plan of  reorganization that is confirmed in a title 11 or similar case (within  the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) but only until the time the plan  becomes effective--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any option created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances  to the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The option created by the confirmation of the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any option created under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph (o) generally applies to any testing date  occurring on or after September 5, 1990.
