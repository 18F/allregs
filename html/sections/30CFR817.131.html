This notice shall  include a statement of the exact number of surface acres and the  horizontal and vertical extent of sub-surface strata which have been in  the permit area prior to cessation or abandonment, the extent and kind  of reclamation of surface area which will have been accomplished, and  identification of the backfilling, regrading, revegetation,  environmental monitoring, underground opening closures and water  treatment activities that will continue during the temporary cessation.</p>
