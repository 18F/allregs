                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each district has a Criminal Investigation function  whose mission is to encourage and achieve the highest possible degree of  voluntary compliance with the internal revenue laws by: Enforcing the  statutory sanctions applicable to income, estate, gift, employment, and  certain excise taxes through the investigation of possible criminal  violations of such laws and the recommendation (when warranted) of  prosecution and/or assertion of the 50 percent ad valorem addition to  the tax; developing information concerning the extent of criminal  violations of all Federal tax laws (except those relating to alcohol,  tobacco, narcotics, and firearms); measuring the effectiveness of the  investigation process; and providing protection of persons and of  property and other enforcement coordination as required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigative procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A witness when questioned in an  investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Division may have  counsel present to represent and advise him. Upon request, a copy of an  affidavit or transcript of a question and answer statement will be  furnished a witness promptly, except in circumstances deemed by the  Regional Commissioner to necessitate temporarily withholding a copy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A taxpayer who may be the subject of a criminal recommendation  will be afforded a district Criminal Investigation conference when he  requests one or where the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division, makes  a determination that such a conference will be in the best interests of  the Government. At the conference, the IRS representative will inform  the taxpayer by a general oral statement of the alleged fraudulent  features of the case, to the extent consistent with protecting the  Government's interests, and, at the same time, making available to the  taxpayer sufficient facts and figures to acquaint him with the basis,  nature, and other essential elements of the proposed criminal charges  against him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Processing of cases after investigation. The Chief, Criminal  Investigation Division, shall ordinarily notify the subject of an  investigation and his authorized representative, if any, when he  forwards a case to the Regional Counsel with a recommendation for  prosecution. The rule will not apply if the case is with a United States  Attorney.
