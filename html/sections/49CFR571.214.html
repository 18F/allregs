Rotate the left thigh outboard about the hip until the center of the knee is the same distance from the midsagittal plane of the dummy as the right knee 5 mm (0.2 in). Using only the control that moves the seat fore and aft, attempt to return the seat to the full forward position. If either of the dummy's legs first contacts the steering wheel, then adjust the steering wheel, if adjustable, upward until contact with the steering wheel is avoided. If the steering wheel is not adjustable, separate the knees enough to avoid steering wheel contact. Proceed with moving

the seat forward until either the leg contacts the vehicle interior or the seat reaches the full forward position. (The right foot may contact and depress the accelerator and/or change the angle of the foot with respect to the leg during seat movement.) If necessary to avoid contact with the vehicle's brake or clutch pedal, rotate the test dummy's left foot about the leg.

If it is not possible to level the transverse instrumentation platform to within 0.5 degrees, select the seat back adjustment position that minimizes the difference between the transverse instrumentation platform angle and level, then adjust the neck bracket to level the transverse instrumentation platform angle to within 0.5 degrees if possible. If it is still not possible to level the transverse instrumentation platform to within 0.5 degrees, select the neck bracket angle position that minimizes the difference between the transverse instrumentation platform angle and level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> If the torso contacts the steering wheel, adjust the steering wheel in the following order until there is no contact: telescoping adjustment, lowering adjustment, raising adjustment.

If after these adjustments, the dummy contact point is more than 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior and the seat is still not in its forwardmost position, move the seat forward until the contact point is 5 mm (0.2 in) or less from the vehicle interior, or if it has a manual seat adjustment, move the seat to the closest detent position without making contact, or until the seat reaches its forwardmost position, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Driver foot positioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal, adjust it to the full forward position.

The seat cushion reference line angle position may be achieved through the use of any seat or seat cushion adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat or seat cushion fore-aft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fully recline the seat back, if adjustable. Place the dummy into the passenger's seat, such that when the legs are positioned 120 degrees to the thighs, the calves of the legs are not touching the seat cushion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bucket seats. Place the dummy on the seat cushion so that its midsagittal plane is vertical and passes through the SgRP within 10 mm (0.4 in).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bench seats. Position the midsagittal plane of the dummy vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and the same distance from the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, within 10 mm (0.4 in), as the midsagittal plane of the driver dummy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Hold the dummy's thighs down and push rearward on the upper torso to maximize the dummy's pelvic angle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Place the legs at 120 degrees to the thighs. Set the initial transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees at 160 to 170 mm (6.3 to 6.7 in), with the thighs and legs of the dummy in vertical planes. Push rearward on the dummy's knees to force the pelvis into the seat so there is no gap between the pelvis and the seat back or until contact occurs between the back of the dummy's calves and the front of the seat cushion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Gently rock the upper torso relative to the lower torso laterally in a side to side motion three times through a 5 degree arc (approximately 51 mm (2 in) side to side).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If needed, extend the legs slightly so that the feet are not in contact with the floor pan. Let the thighs rest on the seat cushion to the extent permitted by the foot movement. With the feet perpendicular to the legs, place the heels on the floor pan. If a heel will not contact the floor pan, place it as close to the floor pan as possible. Using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, attempt to return the seat to the full forward position. If a dummy leg contacts the vehicle interior before the full forward position is attained, position the seat at the next detent where there is no contact. If the seats are power seats, position the seat to avoid contact while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the vehicle interior and the point on the dummy that would first contact the vehicle interior.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Head leveling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Vehicles with fixed seat backs. Adjust the lower neck bracket to level the transverse instrumentation platform angle of the head to within 0.5 degrees. If it is not possible to level the transverse instrumentation platform to within 0.5 degrees, select the neck bracket adjustment position that minimizes the difference between the transverse instrumentation platform angle and level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vehicles with adjustable seat backs. While holding the thighs in place, rotate the seat back forward until the transverse instrumentation platform angle of the head is level to within 0.5 degrees, making sure that the pelvis does not interfere with the seat bight. If it is not possible to level the transverse instrumentation platform to within 0.5 degrees, select the seat back adjustment position that minimizes the difference between the transverse instrumentation platform angle and level, then adjust the neck bracket to level the transverse instrumentation platform angle to within 0.5 degrees if possible. If it is still not possible to level the transverse instrumentation platform to within 0.5 degrees, select the neck bracket angle position that minimizes the difference between the transverse instrumentation platform angle and level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Measure and set the dummy's pelvic angle using the pelvic angle gage. The angle is set to 20.0 degrees 2.5 degrees. If this is not possible, adjust the pelvic angle as close to 20.0 degrees as possible while keeping the transverse instrumentation platform of the head as level as possible by adjustments specified in S12.3.2(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> If the dummy is contacting the vehicle interior after these adjustments, move the seat rearward until

there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) between the contact point of the dummy and the interior of the vehicle or if it has a manual seat adjustment, to the next rearward detent position. If after these adjustments, the dummy contact point is more than 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior and the seat is still not in its forwardmost position, move the seat forward until the contact point is 5 mm (0.2 in) or less from the vehicle interior, or if it has a manual seat adjustment, move the seat to the closest detent position without making contact, or until the seat reaches its forwardmost position, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Passenger foot positioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Place the front passenger's feet flat on the toe board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the feet cannot be placed flat on the toe board, set them perpendicular to the leg center lines and place them as far forward as possible with the heels resting on the floor pan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If either foot does not contact the floor pan, place the foot parallel to the floor pan and place the lower leg as perpendicular to the thigh as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Passenger arm/hand positioning. Place the dummy's upper arm such that the angle between the projection of the arm centerline on the midsagittal plane of the dummy and the torso reference line is 45[deg] 5[deg]. The torso reference line is defined as the thoracic spine centerline. The shoulder-arm joint allows for discrete arm positions at 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degree settings where positive is forward of the spine.</p><p class="depth0">S12.3.4 5th percentile female in rear outboard seating positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Set the rear outboard seat at the full rearward, full down position determined in S8.3.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fully recline the seat back, if adjustable.
