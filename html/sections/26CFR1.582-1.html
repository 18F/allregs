                                Sec. 1.582-1  Bad debts, losses, and gains with respect to securities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), and (c) of section 166 with respect to  a debt which has become worthless in whole or in part and which is  evidenced by a security (a bond, debenture, note, certificate, or other  evidence of indebtedness to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money)  issued by any corporation (including governments and their political  subdivisions), with interest coupons or in registered form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Worthless stock in affiliated bank. For purposes of section  165(g)(1), relating to the deduction for losses involving worthless  securities, if the taxpayer is a bank (as defined in section 581) and  owns directly at least 80 percent of each class of stock of another  bank, stock in such other bank shall not be treated as a capital asset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pre-1970 sales and exchanges of bonds, etc., by banks. For  taxable years beginning before July 12, 1969, with respect to the  taxation under subtitle A of the Code of a bank (as defined in section  581), if the losses of the taxable year from sales or exchanges of  bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates, or other evidences of  indebtedness, issued by any corporation (including one issued by a  government or political subdivision thereof), exceed the gains of the  taxable year from such sales or exchanges, no such sale or exchange  shall be considered a sale or exchange of a capital asset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Post-1969 sales and exchanges of securities by financial  institutions. For taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, the sale  or exchange of a security is not considered the sale or exchange of a  capital asset if such sale or exchange is made by a financial  institution to which any of the following sections applies: Section 585  (relating to banks), 586 (relating to small business investment  companies and business development corporations), or 593 (relating to  mutual savings banks, domestic building and loan associations, and  cooperative banks). This paragraph shall apply to determine the  character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a security  notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code, such as  section 1233 (relating to short sales). However, this paragraph shall  have no effect in the determination of whether a security is a capital  asset under section 1221 for purposes of applying any other provision of  the Code, such as section 1232 (relating to original issue discount).  For purposes of this paragraph, a security is a bond, debenture, note,  or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by any person.  See paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section for special transitional  rules applicable, respectively, to banks and to small business  investment companies and business development corporations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transition rule for qualifying securities held by banks--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this  section, if the net long-term capital gain from sales and exchanges of  qualifying securities exceeds the net short-term capital loss from such  sales and exchanges in any taxable year beginning after July 11, 1969,  such excess shall be treated as long-term capital gain, but in an amount  not to exceed the net gain from sales and exchanges of securities in  such year. For purposes of computing such net gain, a capital loss  carried to the taxable year under section 1212 shall not be taken into  account. See section 1222 and the regulations thereunder for definitions  of the terms net long-term capital gain and net short-term capital loss.  For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term security means a security within the meaning of  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The term qualifying security means a security which is held by  the bank on July 11, 1969, and continuously thereafter until it is first  sold or exchanged by the bank   See also subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules under which the  time certain securities are held is deemed to include a period of time  determined under section 1223 (1) and (2) with respect to such security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computation of capital gain or loss. For purposes of this  paragraph, the amount of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a  qualifying security treated as capital gain or loss is determined by  multiplying the amount of gain or loss recognized from such sale or  exchange by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days  before July 12, 1969, that such security was held by the bank and the  denominator of which is the sum of the number of days included in the  numerator and the number of days the security was held by the bank after  July 11, 1969.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rules. For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this  paragraph, the following items are not taken into account:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any amount treated as original issue discount under section  1232, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any amount which, without regard to section 582(c) and this  section, would be treated as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of  property which is not a capital asset, such as an amount which is  realized from the sale or exchange of a security which is held by a bank  as a dealer in securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Holding period in certain cases. For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time a security received in an exchange is deemed to have  been held by a bank includes a period of time determined under section  1223(1) with respect to such security.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The time a security transferred to a bank from another bank is  deemed to have been held by the transferee bank includes a period of  time determined under section 1223(2) with respect to such security   For example, if a bank on December 3, 1972, surrendered an obligation of  the United States which it held as a capital asset on July 11, 1969, in  a transaction to which section 1037 applied, the time during which the  newly received obligation is deemed to have been held includes the time  during which the surrendered obligation was deemed to have been held by  the bank. Because the surrendered obligation was held on July 11, 1969,  the newly acquired obligation is deemed to have been held on that date  and is a qualifying security. The period during which the surrendered  obligation is deemed to have been held is taken into account in  computing the fraction determined under subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph with respect to the newly received obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Bank A, a calendar year taxpayer, purchased a qualifying  security on July 14, 1968, and held it to maturity on August 20, 1970,  when it was redeemed. The redemption resulted in a taxable gain of  $10,000. The security was held by the bank for 363 days before July 12,  1969, and for a total of 768 days. During the taxable year, the bank had  no other gains and no losses from sales or exchanges of qualifying  securities, but had a net loss of $4,000 from sales of securities other  than qualifying securities. The portion of the gain from the redemption  of the qualifying security treated as capital gain under subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph is $4,726.56 (363/768x$10,000). Because the net  gain of the taxable year from sales and exchanges of securities, $6,000  ($10,000-$4,000), exceeds the portion of the gain on the sale of the  qualifying security treated as capital gain under this paragraph,  $4,726.56 is treated as long-term capital gain on the sale of the  qualifying security for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the  bank's net loss of the taxable year from the sale of securities other  than qualifying securities was $7,000. The amount considered as long- term capital gain under this paragraph is limited by the amount of gain  on the sale of securities to $3,000 ($10,000-$7,000).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Small business investment companies and business development  corporations--(1) Election. In the case of a small business investment  company or a business development corporation, described in section  586(a), section 582(c) does not apply for taxable years beginning after  July 11, 1969, and before July 11, 1974, unless the taxpayer elects that  such section shall apply. In the case of a small business investment  company, see paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 1.1243-1 if such an election is  made, but see paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.1243-1 if such an election is  not made. Such election applies to all such taxable years and, except as  provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, is irrevocable. Such  election must be made not later than (i) the time, including extensions  thereof, prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return  for its first taxable year beginning after July 11, 1969, or (ii) June  8, 1970, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manner of making election. An election pursuant to the  provisions of this paragraph is made by the taxpayer by a written  statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return (or an amended  return) for its first taxable year beginning after July 11, 1969. Such  statement shall indicate that the election is made pursuant to section  433(d) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 624). The taxpayer shall  attach to its income tax return for each subsequent taxable year to  which such election is applicable a statement indicating that the  election has been made and the amount to which it applies for such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of election. An election made pursuant to  subparagraph (2) of   this paragraph shall be irrevocable unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A written application for consent to revoke the election,  setting forth the reasons therefor, is filed with the Commissioner  within 90 days after the permanent regulations relating to section  433(d)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 624) are filed with  the Office of the Federal Register, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commissioner consents to the revocation.  The revocation is effective for all taxable years to which the election  applied.  [T.D. 7171, 37 FR 5620, Mar. 17, 1972; 37 FR 6400, Mar. 29, 1972]</p>
