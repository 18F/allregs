                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If your engine system includes features that recover and store  energy during engine motoring operation test the engine as described in  paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this section, features  that recover energy between the engine and transmission are considered  related to engine motoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you produce a hybrid engine designed with power take-off  capability and sell the engine coupled with a transmission, you may  calculate a reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from the  power take-off operation as described in 40 CFR 1037.525. Use good  engineering judgment to use the vehicle-based procedures to quantify the  CO2 reduction for your engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The hardware that must be included in these tests is the engine,  the hybrid electric motor, the rechargeable energy storage system (RESS)  and the power electronics between the hybrid electric motor and the  RESS. You may ask us to modify the provisions of this section to allow  testing non-electric hybrid vehicles, consistent with good engineering  judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Measure emissions using the same procedures that apply for  testing non-hybrid engines under this part, except as specified  otherwise in this part and/or 40 CFR part 1065. If you test hybrid  engines using the SET, deactivate the   hybrid features unless we have specified otherwise. The five differences  that apply under this section are related to engine mapping, engine  shutdown during the test cycle, calculating work, limits on braking  energy, and state of charge constraints.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Map the engine as specified in 40 CFR 1065.510. This requires  separate torque maps for the engine with and without the hybrid features  active. For transient testing, denormalize the test cycle using the map  generated with the hybrid feature active. For steady-state testing,  denormalize the test cycle using the map generated with the hybrid  feature inactive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the engine will be configured in actual use to shut down  automatically during idle operation, you may let the engine shut down  during the idle portions of the test cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>. For the positive  work over the cycle set negative power from hybrid to zero. For the  negative work over the cycle set the positive power to zero and set the  non-hybrid power to zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate brake energy fraction, xb, as the  integrated negative work over the cycle divided by the integrated  positive work over the cycle according to Equation 1036.525-1. Calculate  the brake energy limit for the engine, xbl, according to  Equation 1036.525-2. If xb is less than xbl, use  the integrated positive work for your emission calculations. If the  xb is greater than xbl use Equation 1036.525-3 to  calculate the positive work done over the cycle. Use Wcycle  as the integrated positive work when calculating brake-specific  emissions. To avoid the need to delete extra brake work from positive  work you may set an instantaneous brake target that will prevent  xb from being larger than xbl, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15SE11.007</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following definitions of terms apply for this paragraph  (d)(4):</p><p class="depth4">xb = the brake energy fraction.</p><p class="depth4">Wneg = the negative work over the cycle.</p><p class="depth4">Wpos = the positive work over the cycle.</p><p class="depth4">xbl = the brake energy fraction limit.</p><p class="depth4">Pmax = the maximum power of the engine with the hybrid  system engaged (kW).</p><p class="depth4">Wcycle = the work over the cycle when xb is  greater than xbl.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Note that these calculations are specified with SI units (such  as kW),   consistent with 40 CFR part 1065. Emission results are converted to g/ hp-hr at the end of the calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Correct for the net energy change of the energy storage device  as described in 40 CFR 1066.501.  [76 FR 57381, Sept. 15, 2011, as amended at 78 FR 36389, June 17, 2013]</p>
