                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Legislative authority. Section 14 of the Flood Control Act  approved July 24, 1946, as amended by section 27 of the Water Resources  Development Act approved March 7, 1974, states:</p><p class="depth2">The Secretary of the Army is authorized to allot from any  appropriations heretofore or hereinafter made for flood control, not to  exceed $10,000,000 per year, for the construction, repair, restoration,  and modification of emergency streambank and shoreline protection works  to prevent damage to highways, bridge approaches, public works,  churches, hospitals, schools, and other nonprofit public services, when  in the opinion of the Chief of Engineers such work is advisable:  Provided, That not more than $250,000 shall be allotted for this purpose  at any single locality from the appropriations for any one fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. Work under the Section 14 authority shall serve to  prevent flood or erosion damages to endangered highways, highway bridge  approaches, public works, and nonprofit public facilities by the  construction or repair of emergency streambank and shoreline protection  works. Eligible highways consist of major highway systems of national  importance, and principal highways, streets, and roads of importance to  the local community, such as arterial streets, important access   routes to other communities and adjacent settlements, and roads  designated as primary farm-to-market roads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Work under this authority is not limited in engineering scope  but the design must be an integrally complete within itself project that  does not require additional work for effective and successful operation.  The cost limitation on Federal participation may require that local  interests supplement the Federal funds, so that combined Federal and  local efforts will produce a complete, useful improvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting officers must be satisfied that the protection of  eligible public works and non-profit public services are justified on  the basis of the National Economic Development and Environmental Quality  objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Legislative interpretations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Public Works'' are considered  to be those important and essential public facilities which serve the  general public and are owned and operated by the Federal, State, or  local governments, such as municipal water supply systems and sewage  disposal plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Churches, hospitals, schools'' includes churches, and public  and private non-profit hospitals and schools.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Non-profit public services'' are considered to be facilities  or structures which serve the general public and are not intended to  earn a profit. Although they may be publicly used, privately owned,  profit-making facilities located along streambanks or shore lines are  not eligible for protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Shoreline'' includes, but is not limited to, oceans, gulfs,  and the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> are  applicable.</p>
