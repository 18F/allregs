                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority and scope. This regulation is issued by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to title VII (Equal  Credit Opportunity Act) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as  amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). Except as otherwise provided herein,  this regulation applies to all persons who are creditors, as defined in  Sec. 202.2(1). Information collection requirements contained in this  regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget  under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned  OMB No. 7100-0201.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is to promote the  availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to  race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or   age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact  that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public  assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith  exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The  regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis  of any of these factors. The regulation also requires creditors to  notify applicants of action taken on their applications; to report  credit history in the names of both spouses on an account; to retain  records of credit applications; to collect information about the  applicant's race and other personal characteristics in applications for  certain dwelling-related loans; and to provide applicants with copies of  appraisal reports used in connection with credit transactions.</p>
