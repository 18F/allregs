                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NLRB will promptly make written demand upon the debtor for payment of money or the return of specific property. The written demand for payment will be consistent with the requirements of 31 CFR chapter IX Sec. 901.2. The date by which payment is due to avoid any late charges will be 60 days from the date that the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The failure to state in a letter of demand a matter described in 31 CFR chapter IX Sec. 901.2 is not a defense for a debtor and does not prevent the NLRB from proceeding with respect to that matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When necessary, to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate action, including immediate referral for litigation. It may be appropriate to contact a debtor or his representative or guarantor by other means (telephone, in person, etc.) to discuss prompt payment, the debtor's ability to repay the debt, and to inform the debtor of his rights and the affect of nonpayment or delayed payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the NLRB learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the NLRB will cease collection action immediately unless it has been determined that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect.</p>
