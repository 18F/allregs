For all initial title II cases, we calculate the mean number of days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, from the day the case folder is received in the State agency until the day it is released to us by the State agency. For initial title XVI cases, we

calculate the mean number of days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, from the day the case folder is received in the State agency until the day there is systems input of a presumptive disability decision or the day the case folder is released to us by the State agency, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of review. Title II processing times and title XVI processing times are monitored separately on a quarterly basis. The determination as to whether or not the processing time thresholds have been met is made at the end of each quarter each year. Quarterly State-by-State mean processing times are compared with the threshold levels for both title II and title XVI.
