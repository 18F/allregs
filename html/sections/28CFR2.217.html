The subpoena shall specify the time and the place at which the person named therein is commanded to appear, and shall specify any documents required to be produced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A subpoena may be served by any Federal or District of Columbia officer authorized to serve criminal process. The subpoena may be served at any place within the judicial district in which the place specified in the subpoena is located, or any place where the witness may be found.

If the court issues an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission, failure to obey such an order is punishable as contempt, as provided in 18 U.S.C. 4214(a)(2).</p>
