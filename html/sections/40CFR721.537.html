The final report shall contain the contents specified in 40 CFR 792.185.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(1)</em> Except as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D)(2) of this section, if, within 6 weeks of EPA's receipt of a test report and data, the person receives written notice that EPA finds that the data generated by a study are scientifically invalid, the person is prohibited from further manufacture and import of the PMN substance beyond the applicable production volume limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person may continue to manufacture and import the PMN substance beyond the applicable production limit only if so notified, in writing, by EPA in response to the person's compliance with either of the following paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(D)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(i)(D)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person may reconduct the study. If there is sufficient time to reconduct the study and submit the report and data to EPA at least 14 weeks before exceeding the production limit as required by paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C)(3) of this section, the person shall comply with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C)(3) of this section. If there is insufficient time for the person to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C)(3) of this section, the person may exceed the production limit and shall submit the report and data in triplicate to EPA within a reasonable period of time, all as specified by EPA in the notice described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D)(1) of this section. EPA will respond to the person in writing, within 6 weeks of receiving the person's report and data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person may, within 4 weeks of receiving from EPA the notice described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D)(1) of this section, submit to EPA a written report refuting EPA's finding. EPA will respond to the person in writing, within 4 weeks of receiving the person's report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The person is not required to conduct a study specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section if notified in writing by EPA that it is unnecessary to conduct that study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements.
