                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Act in the first paragraph of section 5(a) provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">The head of a Federal department or agency which has the responsibility for administering surface resources of any lands belonging to the United States may file as to such lands in the office of the Secretary of the Interior, or in such office as the Secretary of the Interior may designate, a request for publication of notice to mining claimants, for determination of surface rights, which request shall contain a description of the lands covered thereby, showing the section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace the lands covered by such request, or if such lands are unsurveyed, either the section or sections which would probably embrace such lands when the public land surveys are extended to such lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United States mineral monument.</p><p class="depth0">The ``request for publication of notice to mining claimants'' authorized to be filed by the above-quoted portion of the act can be filed by the Federal department or agency which has the responsibility for administering surface resources of the lands to which the requested notice would relate. It must describe the land covered by the request by section, township, range, and meridian or, if the land is unsurveyed, either the section or sections which would probably embrace such lands when the public land surveys are extended to such lands, or by a metes and bounds description of such area with a tie to a United States mineral monument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A request for publication of notice under this subsection shall be filed with the proper office of the Bureau of Land Management. No request for publication may include lands in more than one district.


Sec. 3712.2-2  Evidence necessary to support a request for publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The second and third paragraphs of section 5(a) of the Act provide in detail for the filing by the head of a Federal department or agency of certain evidence in support of the request for publication of the notice referred to in Sec. 3712.2-1 as follows:</p><p class="depth0">The filing of such request for publication shall be accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits of a person or persons over twenty-one years of age setting forth that the affiant or affiants have examined the lands involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain whether any person or persons were in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands or any part thereof, and, if no person or persons were found to be in actual possession of or engaged in the working of said lands or any

part thereof, on the date of such examination, setting forth such fact, or, if any person or persons were so found to be in actual possession or engaged in such working on the date of such examination, setting forth the name and address of each such person, unless affiant shall have been unable through reasonable inquiry to obtain information as to the name and address of any such person, in which event the affidavit shall set forth fully the nature and results of such inquiry.</p><p class="depth0">The filing of such request for publication shall also be accompanied by the certificate of a title or abstract company, or of a title abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such company's abstractor's or attorney's examination of those instruments which are shown by the tract indexes in the county office of record as affecting the lands described in said request, setting forth the name of any person disclosed by said instruments to have an interest in said lands under any unpatented mining claim heretofore located, together with the address of such person if such address is disclosed by such instruments of record. ``Tract indexes'' as used herein shall mean those indexes, if any, as to surveyed lands identifying instruments as affecting a particular legal subdivision of the public land surveys, and as to unsurveyed lands identifying instruments as affecting a particular probable legal subdivision according to a projected extension of the public land surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This part of the Act requires the filing of an affidavit which may be made by any person or persons over twenty-one years of age who have examined the lands. It must show whether any person or persons were ``in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands (the lands described in the request for publication of notice) or any part thereof'' and, if they were, the name and address of each such person must be given if it can be learned by reasonable inquiry and if it cannot be so learned, the affidavit must show in detail what inquiry or inquiries were made to obtain each such name and address. No definition of the terms ``in actual possession'' or ``engaged in the working of said lands'' will be attempted here, but the affidavits should recite what evidences of occupancy or workings were found. The request for publication must also be accompanied by a certificate executed as provided in the third paragraph of section 5(a) and containing the information required by that paragraph to be furnished. If there are no tract indexes, as defined in the Act, in the county office of record affecting the lands described in the request for publication, a certificate executed as provided in the said third paragraph of section 5(a) to that effect must be furnished.

Sec. 3712.2-6  Service of notice.</p><p class="depth0">The last paragraph of section 5(a) of the Act provides with respect to service of the notice by personal delivery or by registered mail, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Within fifteen days after the date of first publication of such notice, the department or agency requesting such publication (1) shall cause a copy of such notice to be personally delivered to or to be mailed by registered mail addressed to each person in possession or engaged in the working of the land whose name and address is shown by an affidavit filed as aforesaid, and to each person who may have filed, as to any lands described in said notice, a request for notices, as provided in subsection (d) of this section 5, and shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed by registered mail to each person whose name and address is set forth in the title or abstract company's or title abstractor's or attorney's certificate filed as aforesaid, as having an interest in the lands described in said notice under any unpatented mining claim heretofore located, such notice to be directed to such person's address as set forth in such certificate; and (2) shall file in the office where said request for publication was filed an affidavit showing that copies have been so delivered or mailed.


Sec. 3712.2-7  Service of copies; failure to comply.</p><p class="depth0">If the department or agency requesting publication under these regulations shall fail to comply with the requirements of section 5(a) of the Act as to the personal delivery or mailing of a copy of the published notice to any person, the publication of such notice shall be deemed wholly ineffectual as to that person or as to the rights asserted by that person and the failure of that person to file a verified statement, as provided in such notice shall in no manner affect, diminish, prejudice or bar any rights of that person.</p>
