                                Sec. 229.7  Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious injuries.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The Assistant Administrator will establish a program to  monitor incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during  the course of commercial fishing operations in order to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality  and serious injury;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the reliability of reports of incidental mortality and  injury under Sec. 229.6; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may  increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Observer program. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the  Assistant Administrator may observe Category I and II vessels as  necessary. Observers may, among other tasks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Record incidental mortality and injury, and bycatch of other  nontarget species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Perform other scientific investigations, which may include, but  are not limited to, sampling and photographing incidental mortalities  and serious injuries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Observer requirements for participants in Category I and II  fisheries. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If requested by NMFS or by a designated contractor  providing observer services to NMFS, a vessel owner/operator must take  aboard an observer to accompany the vessel on fishing trips.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After being notified by NMFS, or by a designated contractor  providing observer services to NMFS, that the vessel is required to  carry an observer, the vessel owner/operator must comply with the  notification by providing information requested within the specified  time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NMFS, or a designated contractor providing observer services to  NMFS, may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the  facilities for housing the observer or for carrying out observer  functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the  observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The vessel owner/operator and crew must cooperate with the  observer in the performance of the observer's duties including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Providing, at no cost to the observer, the United States  government, or the designated observer provider, food, toilet, bathing,  sleeping accommodations, and other amenities that are equivalent to  those provided to the crew, unless other arrangements are approved in  advance by the Regional Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer as  specified by NMFS personnel or designated contractors. The operator of a  vessel must ensure that transfers of observers at sea are accomplished  in a safe manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours if  feasible, as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the agreement of  the observer involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel  necessary to conduct observer duties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and  navigation equipment, when available on the vessel, as necessary to  perform observer duties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Providing true vessel locations by latitude and longitude,  accurate to the minute, or by loran coordinates, upon request by the  observer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Sampling, retaining, and storing of marine mammal specimens,  other protected species specimens, or target or non-target catch  specimens, upon request by NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or  the observer, if adequate facilities are available and if feasible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Notifying the observer in a timely fashion of when all  commercial fishing operations are to begin and end;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Not impairing or in any way interfering with the research or  observations being carried out; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Complying with other guidelines or regulations that NMFS may  develop to ensure the effective deployment and use of observers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Marine mammals or other specimens identified in paragraph  (c)(4)(vi) of this section, which are readily accessible to crew  members, must be   brought on board the vessel and retained for the purposes of scientific  research if feasible and requested by NMFS personnel, designated  contractors, or the observer. Specimens so collected and retained must,  upon request by NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the observer,  be retained in cold storage on board the vessel, if feasible, until  removed at the request of NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the  observer, retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS, or released by the  observer for return to the ocean. These biological specimens may be  transported on board the vessel during the fishing trip and back to port  under this authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Observer requirements for participants in Category III  fisheries. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Administrator may place observers on  Category III vessels if the Assistant Administrator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Believes that the incidental mortality and serious injury of  marine mammals from such fishery may be contributing to the immediate  and significant adverse impact on a species or stock listed as a  threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species  Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has the consent of the vessel owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an observer is placed on a Category III vessel, the vessel  owner and/or operator must comply with the requirements of Sec.  229.7(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative observer program. The Assistant Administrator may  establish an alternative observer program to provide statistically  reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals  incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. The  alternative observer program may include direct observation of fishing  activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.
