                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The employing agency must promptly submit late contributions to  the TSP record keeper on behalf of the affected participant on late  payment records as soon as the error is discovered. For each pay date  involved, the employing agency must submit a separate record showing the  ``as of'' date for the contributions. Breakage for both employee and  agency contributions will be calculated, posted, and charged to the  agency or forfeited to the TSP in accordance with Sec. 1605.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an employing agency deducts loan payments from a  participant's pay, but fails to submit those payments to the TSP for the  pay date for which they were deducted (or submits them in a manner that  prevents them from being timely credited to the participant's account),  the employing agency will be responsible for paying breakage using the  procedure described in Sec. 1605.2. The loan payment record must contain  the ``as of'' date for which the loan payment was deducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All contributions or loan payments on payment records contained  in a payroll submission that was received from an employing agency more  than 30 days after the pay date associated with the payroll submission  (as reported on the appropriate journal voucher), will be subject to  breakage calculated, posted, and charged to the employing agency (or  forfeited to the TSP) in accordance with Sec. 1605.2. The employing  agency will be apprised of the breakage due for each record reported on  the late submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the ``as of'' date of a late Roth contribution is earlier  than the participant's existing Roth initiation date, the TSP will  adjust the participant's Roth initiation date.
