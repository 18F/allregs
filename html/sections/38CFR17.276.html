                            <p class="depth0">Notice of the initial determination regarding payment of CHAMPVA  benefits will be provided to the beneficiary on a CHAMPVA Explanation of  Benefits (EOB) form. The EOB form is generated by the CHAMPVA automated  payment processing system. If a beneficiary disagrees with the  determination concerning covered services or calculation of benefits, he  or she may request reconsideration. Such requests must be submitted to  the Center in writing within one year of the date of the initial  determination. The request must state why the beneficiary believes the  decision is in error and must include any new and relevant information  not previously considered. Any request for reconsideration that does not  identify the reason for dispute will be returned to the claimant without  further consideration. After reviewing the claim and any relevant  supporting documentation, a CHAMPVA benefits advisor will issue a  written determination to the beneficiary that affirms, reverses or  modifies the previous decision. If the beneficiary is still  dissatisfied, within 90 days of the date of the decision he or she may  make a written request for review by the Director, Health Administration  Center, or his or her designee. The Director, Health Administration  Center, or his or her designee will review the claim, and any relevant  supporting documentation, and issue a decision in writing that affirms,  reverses or modifies the previous decision. The decision of the  Director, Health Administration Center, or his or her designee with  respect to benefit coverage and computation of benefits is final.
