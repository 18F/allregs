Exceptional circumstances for this purpose may include, but are not limited to: the school's loss of accreditation; the school's discontinuation of the majority of its academic programs; action by the State to revoke the school's license to operate or award academic credentials in the State; or a finding by a State or Federal government agency that the school violated State or Federal law; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State that the borrower (or student)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary may discharge a loan under this section without an application from the borrower if the Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies for the discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions.
