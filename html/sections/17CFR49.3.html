                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant, person or entity  desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file  electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in  appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its  headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified  by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions  contained therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application shall include information sufficient to  demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of  the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of  instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents,  information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to  determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core  principles. An application will not be considered to be materially  complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits  as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete,  the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not  be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 180-Day review procedures. The Commission will review the  application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days  of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an  application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the  Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant  submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the  180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration;  extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the  application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day  review period shall commence once a completed submission on Form SDR is  submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission  on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the  Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration  as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission   denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it  shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of  registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be  afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Standard for approval. The Commission shall grant the  registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such  swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity:  to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions  as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the  Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner  consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the  regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent  manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository  if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in  form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and  part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent  with this Sec. 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking  registration that the Commission is denying the application setting  forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which  the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Amendments and annual filing. If any information reported on  Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any  reason, whether before or after the application for registration has  been granted, the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment  on Form SDR updating such information. In addition, the swap data  repository shall annually file an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days  after the end of each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Service of process. Each swap data repository shall designate  and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a  Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process,  pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought  against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> shall terminate within such time as  determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the  Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny  permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of application for registration. An applicant for  registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to  paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a  request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect  any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions,  activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for  registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice  the filing of a new application by such applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reinstatement of dormant registration. Before accepting or re- accepting swap transaction data, a dormant registered swap data  repository as defined in Sec. 40.1(e) of this chapter shall reinstate  its registration under the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this  section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may  rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and  accurately describe, current conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delegation of authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission hereby delegates,  until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the   Division of Market Oversight or the Director's delegates, with the  consultation of the General Counsel or the General Counsel's delegates,  the authority to notify an applicant seeking registration as a swap data  repository pursuant to Section 21 of the Act that the application is  materially incomplete and the 180-day period review period is extended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to  the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated  in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its  election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for confidential treatment. An applicant for  registration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted  in its application as set forth in Sec. Sec. 40.8 and 145.9 of this  chapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in  the application that will be subject to a request for confidential  treatment.</p>
