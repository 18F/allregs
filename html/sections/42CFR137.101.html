                            <p class="depth0">A Self-Governance Tribe is under a duty to invest and manage the  funds as a prudent investor would, in light of the purpose, terms,  distribution requirements, and provisions in the compact or funding  agreement and Title V. This duty requires the exercise of reasonable  care, skill, and caution, and is to be applied to investments not in  isolation but in the context of the investment portfolio and as a part  of an overall investment strategy, which should incorporate risk and  return objectives reasonably suitable to the Self-Governance Tribe. In  making and implementing investment decisions, the Self-Governance Tribe  has a duty to diversify the investments unless, under the circumstances,  it is prudent not to do so. In addition, the Self-Governance Tribe must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conform to fundamental fiduciary duties of loyalty and  impartiality;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Act with prudence in deciding whether and how to delegate  authority and in the selection and supervision of agents; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Incur only costs that are reasonable in amount and appropriate  to the   investment responsibilities of the Self-Governance Tribe.</p><p class="depth2">Carryover of Funds</p>
