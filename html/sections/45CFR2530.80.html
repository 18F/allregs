Upon revocation, the amount revoked will be  deducted from the designated individual's account and credited to the  transferring individual's account. The transferring individual may use  the revoked transferred education award for any of the purposes  described in Sec. 2528.10, consistent with the original time period of  availability set forth in Sec. 2526.40(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Re-transfer. Generally, an individual may not re-transfer an  award to another individual after revoking the same award from the  original designated individual. The Corporation may approve re-transfer  of an award for good cause, including cases in which the original  designated individual was unavoidably prevented from using the award, as  demonstrated by the individual transferring the award.</p>
