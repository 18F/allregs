                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section provides rules for determining the  applicability of reduced rates of tax on a removal or entry of gasohol  or of gasoline used to produce gasohol. Rules are also provided for the  imposition of tax on the separation of gasoline from gasohol and the  failure to use gasoline that has been taxed at a reduced rate to produce  gasohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Explanation of terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alcohol--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general; source of the  alcohol. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section,  alcohol means any alcohol that is not a derivative product of petroleum,  natural gas, or coal (including peat). Thus, the term includes methanol  and ethanol that are not derived from petroleum, natural gas, or coal  (including peat). The term also includes alcohol produced either within  or outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proof and denaturants. Alcohol does not include alcohol with a  proof of less than 190 degrees (determined without regard to added  denaturants). If the alcohol added to a fuel/alcohol mixture (the added  alcohol) includes impurities or denaturants, the volume of alcohol in  the mixture is determined under the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The volume of alcohol in the mixture includes the volume of any  impurities (other than added denaturants and any fuel with which the  alcohol is mixed) that reduce the purity of the added alcohol to not  less than 190 proof (determined without regard to added denaturants).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The volume of alcohol in the mixture includes the volume of any  approved denaturants that reduce the purity of the added alcohol, but  only to the extent that the volume of the approved denaturants does not  exceed five percent of the volume of the added alcohol (including the  approved denaturants). If the volume of the approved denaturants exceeds  five percent of the volume of the added alcohol, the excess over five  percent is considered part of the nonalcohol content of the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), approved denaturants  are any denaturants (including gasoline and nonalcohol fuel denaturants)  that reduce the purity of the added alcohol and are added to such  alcohol under a formula approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Products derived from alcohol. If alcohol described in  paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section has been chemically  transformed in producing another product (that is, the alcohol is no  longer present as a separate chemical in the other product) and there is  no significant loss in the energy content of the alcohol, any mixture  containing the product includes the volume of alcohol used to produce  the product. Thus, for example, a mixture of gasoline and ethyl tertiary  butyl ether (ETBE), or of gasoline and methyl tertiary butyl ether  (MTBE), includes any alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii)  of this section that is used to produce the ETBE or MTBE, respectively,  in a chemical reaction in which there is no significant loss in the  energy content of the alcohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gasohol--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Gasohol is a mixture of gasoline  and alcohol that is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7  percent gasohol. The determination of whether a particular mixture is 10  percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol is made on  a batch-by-batch basis. A batch of gasohol is a discrete mixture of  gasoline and alcohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a particular mixture is produced within the bulk transfer/ terminal system (for example, at a refinery), the determination of  whether the mixture is gasohol is made at the time of the taxable  removal or entry of the mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a particular mixture is produced outside of the bulk  transfer/terminal system (for example, by splash blending after the  gasoline has been removed from the terminal at the rack), the  determination of whether the mixture is gasohol is made immediately  after the mixture is produced. In such a case, the contents of the batch  typically correspond to a gasoline meter delivery ticket and an alcohol  meter delivery ticket, each of which shows   the number of gallons of liquid delivered into the mixture. The volume  of each component in a batch (without adjustment for temperature)  ordinarily is determined by the number of metered gallons shown on the  delivery tickets for the gasoline and alcohol delivered. However, if  metered gallons of gasoline and alcohol are added to a tank already  containing more than a minor amount of liquid, the determination of  whether a batch satisfies the alcohol-content requirement will be made  by taking into account the amount of alcohol and non-alcohol fuel  contained in the liquid already in the tank. Ordinarily, any amount in  excess of 0.5 percent of the capacity of the tank will not be considered  minor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 10 percent gasohol--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A batch of gasoline/alcohol  mixture is 10 percent gasohol if it contains at least 9.8 percent  alcohol by volume, without rounding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Batches containing less than 10 percent but at least 9.8 percent  alcohol. If a batch of mixture contains less than 10 percent alcohol but  at least 9.8 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a portion of the  batch is considered to be 10 percent gasohol. That portion equals the  number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied by 10. Any  remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 7.7 percent gasohol--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A batch of gasoline/ alcohol mixture is 7.7 percent gasohol if it contains less than 9.8  percent alcohol but at least 7.55 percent alcohol by volume, without  rounding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Batches containing less than 7.7 percent but at least 7.55  percent alcohol. If a batch of mixture contains less than 7.7 percent  alcohol but at least 7.55 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a  portion of the batch is considered to be 7.7 percent gasohol. That  portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied  by 12.987. Any remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 5.7 percent gasohol--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A batch of gasoline/ alcohol mixture is 5.7 percent gasohol if it contains less than 7.55  percent alcohol but at least 5.59 percent alcohol by volume, without  rounding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Batches containing less than 5.7 percent but at least 5.59  percent alcohol. If a batch of mixture contains less than 5.7 percent  alcohol but at least 5.59 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a  portion of the batch is considered to be 5.7 percent gasohol. That  portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied  by 17.544. Any remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Tax on excess liquid. If tax was imposed on the excess liquid in  any gasohol at the gasohol production tax rate (as defined in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section), the excess liquid in the batch is considered to  be gasoline with respect to which there is a failure to blend into  gasohol for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. If tax was  imposed on the excess liquid at the rate of tax described in section  4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is not allowed with  respect to the excess liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (b)(2). In these examples, a gasohol blender creates a gasoline/alcohol  mixture by pumping a specified amount of gasoline into an empty tank and  then adding a specified amount of alcohol.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Mixtures containing exactly 10 percent alcohol. The  applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made with 7200  metered gallons of gasoline and 800 metered gallons of alcohol.  Accordingly, the mixture contains 10 percent alcohol (as determined  based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender) and qualifies as  10 percent gasohol.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Mixtures containing less than 10 percent alcohol but at  least 9.8 percent alcohol. The applicable delivery tickets show that the  mixture is made with 7205 metered gallons of gasoline and 795 metered  gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture contains less than 10 percent  alcohol, but more than 9.8 percent alcohol (as determined based on the  delivery tickets provided to the blender), 7950 gallons of the mixture  qualify as 10 percent gasohol. If tax was imposed on the gasoline in the  mixture at the gasohol production rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol,  the remaining 50 gallons of the mixture (the excess liquid) are treated  as gasoline with respect to which there was a failure to blend into  gasohol for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. If tax was  imposed on the gasoline in the mixture at the rate of tax described in  section 4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is allowed  only with respect to 7155 gallons of gasoline.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Mixtures containing less than 5.59 percent alcohol. The  applicable delivery   tickets show that the mixture is made with 7568 metered gallons of  gasoline and 436 metered gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture  contains only 5.45 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery  tickets provided to the blender), the mixture does not qualify as  gasohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gasohol blender. Gasohol blender means any person that regularly  produces gasohol outside of the bulk transfer/terminal system for sale  or use in its trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Registered gasohol blender. Registered gasohol blender means a  person that is registered under section 4101 as a gasohol blender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (relating to tax imposed on entries) is the gasohol  production tax rate if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person liable for tax under Sec. 48.4081-2(c)(1) (the  position holder), Sec. 48.4081-3(b)(3) (the refiner), or Sec. 48.4081- 3(c)(2) (the enterer) is a taxable fuel registrant and a registered  gasohol blender, and such person produces gasohol with the gasoline  within 24 hours after removing or entering the gasoline; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gasoline is sold in connection with the removal or entry,  the person liable for tax under Sec. 48.4081-2(c)(1) (the position  holder), Sec. 48.4081-3(b)(3) (the refiner), or Sec. 48.4081-3(c)(2)  (the enterer) is a taxable fuel registrant and the person, at the time  of the sale,--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has an unexpired certificate (as described in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section) from the buyer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has no reason to believe that any information in the certificate  is false.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The certificate referred to in  paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is a statement that is to be  provided by a registered gasohol blender that is signed under penalties  of perjury by a person with authority to bind the registered gasohol  blender, is in substantially the same form as the model certificate  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and contains all  information necessary to complete such model certificate. A new  certificate must be given if any information in the current certificate  changes. The certificate may be included as part of any business records  normally used to document a sale. The certificate expires on the  earliest of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date one year after the effective date of the certificate  (which may be no earlier than the date it is signed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date the registered gasohol blender provides a new  certificate to the seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date the seller is notified by the Internal Revenue Service  or the gasohol blender that the gasohol blender's registration has been  revoked or suspended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Model certificate.</p><p class="depth0">Certificate of Registered Gasohol Blender  (To support sales of gasoline at the gasohol production tax rate under  section 4081(c) of the Internal Revenue Code)  ________________________________________________________________________  Name, address, and employer identification number of seller</p><p class="depth0">-------------------- (Buyer) certifies the following under penalties  of perjury:</p><p class="depth0">Buyer is registered as a gasohol blender with registration number -- --------------.

A copy of the certificate of registry  (Form 637) or letter of registration issued to a gasohol blender by the  Internal Revenue Service is not a gasohol blender's certificate  described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rate of tax on gasohol removed or entered. The rate of tax  imposed on removals or entries of any gasohol under Sec. Sec. 48.4081- 2(b), 48.4081-3(b)(1), and 48.4081-3(c)(1) is the gasohol tax rate. The  rate of tax imposed on removals and entries of excess liquid described  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is the rate of tax applicable to  gasoline under section 4081(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tax rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gasohol production tax rate. The gasohol  production tax rate is the applicable rate of tax determined under  section 4081(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gasohol tax rate.

A tax is imposed on the removal or sale of gasoline  separated from gasohol with respect to which tax was imposed at a rate  described in paragraph (e) of this section or with respect to which a  credit or payment was allowed or made by reason of section 6427(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liability for tax. The person that owns the gasohol at the time  gasoline is separated from the gasohol is liable for the tax imposed  under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rate of tax. The rate of tax imposed under paragraph (f)(1)(i)  of this section is the difference between the rate of tax applicable to  gasoline not described in this section and the applicable gasohol  production tax rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to blend--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Imposition of tax. Tax is imposed on the  entry, removal, or sale of gasoline (including excess liquid described  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) with respect to which tax was  imposed at a gasohol production tax rate if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The gasoline was not blended into gasohol; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The gasoline was blended into gasohol but the gasohol production  tax rate applicable to the type of gasohol produced is greater than the  rate of tax originally imposed on the gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liability for tax. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of gasoline with respect to  which tax was imposed at the gasohol production tax rate under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section, the person liable for the tax imposed by  paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is the person that was liable for  tax on the entry or removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of gasoline with respect to which tax was imposed at  the gasohol production tax rate under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section, the person that bought the gasoline in connection with the  entry or removal is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (f)(2)(i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rate of tax. The rate of tax imposed on gasoline described in  paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the difference between the  rate of tax applicable to gasoline not described in this section and the  rate of tax previously imposed on the gasoline. The rate of tax imposed  on gasoline described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section is the  difference between the gasohol production tax rate applicable to the  type of gasohol produced and the rate of tax previously imposed on the  gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph  (f)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A registered gasohol blender bought gasoline in  connection with a removal described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section. Based on the blender's certification (described in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section) that the blender would produce 10 percent  gasohol with the gasoline, tax at the gasohol production tax rate  applicable to 10 percent gasohol was imposed on the removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The blender then produced a mixture by splash blending in a  tank holding approximately 8000 gallons of mixture. The applicable  delivery tickets show that the mixture was blended by first pumping 7220  metered gallons of gasoline into the empty tank, and then pumping 780  metered gallons of alcohol into the tank. Because the mixture contains  9.75 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery tickets  provided to the blender) the entire mixture qualifies as 7.7 percent  gasohol, rather than 10 percent gasohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the 7220 gallons of gasoline were taxed at the gasohol  production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol but the gasoline  was blended into 7.7 percent gasohol, a failure to blend has occurred  with respect to the gasoline. As the person that bought the gasoline in  connection with the taxable removal, the blender is liable for the tax  imposed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The amount of tax  imposed is the difference between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate applicable to  7.7 percent gasohol; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate applicable to  10 percent gasohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Because the gasohol does not contain exactly 7.7 percent  alcohol, the benefit of the gasohol production tax rate with respect to  the alcohol is less than the amount of the alcohol mixture credit under  section 40(b) (determined before the application of section 40(c)).  Accordingly, the blender may be entitled to claim an alcohol mixture  credit for the alcohol used in the gasohol. Under section 40(c),  however, the amount of the alcohol mixture credit must be reduced to  take into account the benefit provided with respect to the alcohol by  the gasohol production tax rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date.
