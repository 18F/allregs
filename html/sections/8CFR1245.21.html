                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. The Service may adjust the status to that of a  lawful permanent resident, a native or citizen of Vietnam, Cambodia, or  Laos who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was inspected and paroled into the United States before October  1, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was paroled into the United States from Vietnam under the  auspices of the Orderly Departure Program (ODP), a refugee camp in East  Asia, or a displaced person camp administered by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Thailand;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Was physically present in the United States prior to and on  October 1, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Files an application for adjustment of status in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section during the 3-year application period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Is otherwise eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is  otherwise admissible as an immigrant to the United States except as  provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applying for benefits under section 586 of Public Law 106-429-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application period. The application period lasts from January 27,  2003 until January 25, 2006. The Service will accept applications  received after the end of the application period, but only if the 5,000  limit on adjustments has not been reached prior to the end of the three- year application period, and the application bears an official postmark  dated on or before the final day of the application period. Postmarks  will be evaluated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the postmark is illegible or missing, the Service will  consider the application to be timely filed if it is received on or  before 3 business days after the end of the application period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In all instances, the burden of proof is on the applicant to  establish timely filing of an application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. An alien must be physically present in the United  States to apply for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law  106-429. An applicant must submit Form I-485, Application to Register  Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, along with the appropriate  application fee contained in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.  Applicants who are 14 through 79 years of age must also submit the  fingerprinting service fee provided for in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this  chapter. Each application filed must be accompanied by evidence  establishing eligibility as provided in paragraph (g) of this section;  two photographs as described in the Form I-485 instructions; a completed  Biographic Information Sheet (Form G-325A) if the applicant is between  14 and 79 years of age; a report of medical examination (Form I-693 and  vaccination supplement) specified in Sec. 1245.5; and, if needed, an  application for waiver of inadmissibility. Under Part 2, question h of  Form I-485, applicants must write ``INDOCHINESE PAROLEE P.L. 106-429''.  Applications must be sent to: INS Nebraska Service Center, P.O. Box  87485, Lincoln NE 68501-7485.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications from aliens in immigration proceedings. An alien in  pending immigration proceedings who believes he or she is eligible for  adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 must apply  directly to the Service in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section. An immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals may  not adjudicate applications for adjustment of status under this section.  An alien who is currently in immigration proceedings who alleges  eligibility for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law  106-429 may contact Service counsel after filing an application to  request the consent of the Service to the filing of a joint motion for  administrative closure. Unless the Service consents to such a motion,  the immigration judge or the Board may not defer or dismiss the  proceeding in connection with section 586 of Public Law 106-429.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications from aliens with final orders of removal,  deportation, or exclusion. An alien with a final order of removal,  deportation, or exclusion who believes he or she is eligible for  adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 must apply  directly to the Service in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application under this section does not automatically stay  the order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. An alien who is  eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106- 429 may request that the district director with jurisdiction over the  alien grant a stay of removal during the pendency of the application.  The regulations governing such a request are found at 8 CFR 241.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Service in general will exercise its discretion not to grant  a stay of removal, deportation, or exclusion with respect to an alien  who is inadmissible on any of the grounds specified in paragraph (m)(3)  of this section, unless there is substantial reason to believe that the  Service will grant the necessary waivers of inadmissibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An immigration judge or the Board may not grant a motion to re- open or stay in connection with an application under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Service approves the application, the approval will  constitute the automatic re-opening of the alien's immigration  proceedings, vacating of the final order of removal, deportation, or  exclusion, and termination of the reopened proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grounds of inadmissibility that do not apply. In making a  determination of whether an applicant is otherwise eligible for  admission to the United States for lawful permanent residence under the  provisions of section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the grounds of  inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(7)(A), and (a)(9)  of the Act shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver of grounds of inadmissibility. In connection with an  application for adjustment of status under this section, the alien may  apply for a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility under sections  212(a)(1), (a)(6)(B), (a)(6)(C), (a)(6)(F), (a)(8)(A), (a)(10)(B), and  (a)(10)(D) of the Act as provided in section 586(c) of Public Law 106- 429, if the alien demonstrates that a waiver is necessary to prevent  extreme hardship to the alien, or to the alien's spouse, parent, son or  daughter who is a U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for  permanent residence. In addition, the alien may apply for any other  waiver of inadmissibility under section 212 of the Act, if eligible. In  order to obtain a waiver for any of these grounds, an applicant must  submit Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability,  with the application for adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence. Applicants must submit evidence that demonstrates they  are eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law  106-429. Such evidence shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A birth certificate or other record of birth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation to establish that the applicant was physically  present in the United States on October 1, 1997, under the standards set  forth in Sec. 1245.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the applicant's Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94)  or other evidence that the alien was inspected or paroled into the  United States prior to October 1, 1997, from one of the three programs  listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Subject to verification,  documentation pertaining to paragraph (a)(2) of this section is already  contained in Service files and the applicant may submit an affidavit to  that effect in lieu of actual documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employment authorization. Applicants who want to obtain  employment authorization based on a pending application for adjustment  of status under this section may submit Form I-765, Application for  Employment Authorization, along with the application fee listed in 8 CFR  103.7(b)(1). If the Service approves the application for employment  authorization, the applicant will be issued an employment authorization  document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Travel while an application to adjust status is pending. An  alien may travel abroad while an application to adjust status is  pending. Applicants must obtain advance parole in order to avoid the  abandonment of their application to adjust status. An applicant may  obtain advance parole by filing Form I-   131, Application for a Travel Document, along with the application fee  listed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1). If the Service approves Form I-131, the  alien will be issued Form I-512, Authorization for the Parole of an  Alien into the United States. Aliens granted advance parole will still  be subject to inspection at a port-of-entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Approval and date of admission as a lawful permanent resident.  When the Service approves an application to adjust status to that of  lawful permanent resident based on section 586 of Public Law 106-429,  the applicant will be notified in writing of the Service's decision. In  addition, the record of the alien's admission as a lawful permanent  resident will be recorded as of the date of the alien's inspection and  parole into the United States, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notice of denial. When the Service denies an application to  adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident based on section 586  of Public Law 106-429, the applicant will be notified of the decision in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Administrative review. An alien whose application for adjustment  of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 is denied by the  Service may appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Office in  accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Number of adjustments permitted under this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit.  No more than 5,000 aliens may have their status adjusted to that of a  lawful permanent resident under section 586 of Public Law 106-429.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counting procedures. Each alien granted adjustment of status  under this section will count towards the 5,000 limit. The Service will  assign a tracking number, ascending chronologically by filing date, to  all applications properly filed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and  (g) of this section. Except as described in paragraph (m)(3) of this  section, the Service will adjudicate applications in that order until it  reaches 5,000 approvals under this part. Applications initially denied  but pending on administrative appeal will retain their place in the  queue by virtue of their tracking number, pending the Service's  adjudication of the appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications submitted with a request for the waiver of a ground  of inadmissibility. In the discretion of the Service, applications that  do not require adjudication of a waiver of inadmissibility under section  212(a)(2), (a)(6)(B), (a)(6)(F), (a)(8)(A), or (a)(10)(D) of the Act may  be approved and assigned numbers within the 5,000 limit before those  applications that do require a waiver of inadmissibility under any of  those provisions. Applications requiring a waiver of any of those  provisions will be assigned a tracking number chronologically by the  date of approval of the necessary waivers rather than the date of filing  of the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedures when the 5,000 limit is reached. The Service will  track the total number of adjustments and stop processing applications  after the 5,000 limit has been reached. When the limit is reached, the  Service will return any additional applications to applicants with a  dated notice encouraging applicants to retain their application package  and the notice in the event the 5,000 limit is expanded or eliminated  and the alien wishes to apply again. The Service will keep an  identifying chronological record of the application for purposes of  processing applications under this section if the 5,000 limit  subsequently is expanded or eliminated. If at the time the 5,000 limit  is reached, it appears that Congress is about to pass legislation to  expand or eliminate the cap, the Service retains the discretion to  retain such applications and the related fees.
