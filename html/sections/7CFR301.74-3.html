Less than an entire State will be  designated as a quarantined area if the Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the  intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are substantially the  same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of  regulated articles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined  area will prevent the interstate spread of plum pox.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any  nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section.
