The request, in order to be effective, must be transmitted separately from any other document, must set forth the classes of tax and the taxable periods for which the prompt assessment is requested, and must clearly indicate that it is a request for prompt assessment under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6501(d). The effect of such a request is to limit the time in which an assessment of tax may be made, or a proceeding in court without assessment for collection of tax may be begun, to a period of 18 months from the date the request is filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The request does not extend the time within which an assessment may be made, or a proceeding in court without assessment shall be begun, after the expiration of 3 years from the date the return was filed. This special period of limitations will not apply to any return filed after a request for prompt assessment has been made unless an additional request is filed in the manner provided herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a corporation the 18-month period shall not apply unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The written request notifies the appropriate TTB officer that the corporation contemplates dissolution at or before the expirationof such 18-month period; the dissolution is in good faith begun before the expiration of such 18-month period; and the dissolution so begun is completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written request notifies the appropriate TTB officer that a dissolution has in good faith begun, and the dissolution is completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A dissolution has been completed at the time the written request is made.
