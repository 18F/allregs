                            <p class="depth0">In certain circumstances, we may exempt portable fuel containers  from the evaporative emission standards and requirements of Sec. 59.611  and the prohibitions and requirements of Sec. 59.602. You do not need an  exemption for any containers that you own but do not sell, offer for  sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into U.S. commerce, or  import into the United States. Submit your request for an exemption to  the Designated Compliance Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Portable fuel containers that are intended for export only and  are in fact exported are exempt provided they are clearly labeled as  being for export only. Keep records for five years of all portable fuel  containers that you manufacture for export. Any introduction into U.S.  commerce of such portable fuel containers for any purpose other than  export is considered to be a violation of Sec. 59.602 by the  manufacturer. You do not need to request this exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may ask us to exempt portable fuel containers that you will  purchase, sell, or distribute for the sole purpose of testing them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may ask us to exempt portable fuel containers for the  purpose of national security, as long as your request is endorsed by an  agency of the federal government responsible for national defense. In  your request, explain why you need the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may ask us to exempt containers that are designed and  marketed solely for rapidly refueling racing applications which are  designed to create a leak proof seal with the target tank or are  designed to connect with a receiver installed on the target tank. This  exemption is generally intended for containers used to rapidly refuel a  race car during a pit stop and similar containers. In your request,  explain how why these containers are unlikely to be used for nonracing  applications. We may limit these exemptions to those applications that  are allowed to use gasoline exempted under 40 CFR 80.200(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EPA may impose reasonable conditions on any exemption, including  a limit on the number of containers that are covered by an exemption.</p>
