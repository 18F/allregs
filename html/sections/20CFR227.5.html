                            <p class="depth0">Employers are entitled to tax credits if they pay non-negotiated  pensions to former employees whose supplemental annuities are reduced  because of the pensions. Non-negotiated pensions are paid under pension  plans that are not established by collective bargaining agreements. The  tax credits for each month equal the sum of the reductions for employer  pensions in the supplemental annuities of all former employees for that  month. The Board sends a report of total tax credits to each employer  after the end of each calendar quarter. The credits are applied to the  man-hour supplemental annuity tax the employer pays the Internal Revenue  Service under section 3221 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act.</p>
