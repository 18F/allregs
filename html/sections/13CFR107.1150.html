                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A Section 301(c) Licensee, other than an Early Stage SBIC, may have  maximum outstanding Leverage as set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (d),  and (e) of this section. An Early Stage SBIC may have maximum  outstanding Leverage as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In  general, SBA will approve Leverage commitment requests in excess of 200  percent of Regulatory Capital and draw requests in excess of 200 percent  of Leverageable Capital only after a Licensee has demonstrated  consistent, sustainable profitability based on a conservative investment  strategy that limits downside risk. Any such Leverage request must be  supported by an up-to-date business plan that reflects continuation of  the Licensee's successful investment strategy and demonstrates the  Licensee's ability to pay all SBA obligations in accordance with their  terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual Licensee. Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you  are a Section 301(c) Licensee, the maximum amount of Leverage you may  have outstanding at any time is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 300 percent of your Leverageable Capital, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> $150 million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiple Licensees under Common Control. Subject to SBA's credit  policies, two or more Licenses under Common Control may have maximum  aggregate outstanding Leverage of $225 million. However, for any  Leverage draw(s) by one or more such Licensees that would cause the  aggregate outstanding Leverage to exceed $150 million, each of the  Licensees under Common Control must certify that it does not have a  condition of Capital Impairment. See also Sec. 107.1120(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Early Stage SBICs. Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you are  an Early Stage SBIC:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount of any and all Leverage commitments you receive  from SBA shall not exceed 100 percent   of your highest Regulatory Capital or $50 million, whichever is less;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On a cumulative basis, the total amount of Leverage you have  issued shall not exceed the total amount of capital paid in by your  investors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum amount of Leverage you may have outstanding at any  time is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent of your Leverageable Capital, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $50 million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> cannot also be used to  seek additional leverage under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Investment in Smaller Enterprises located in low-income  geographic areas. To determine whether you may request a draw that would  cause you to have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amount  determined under paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the cost basis, as reported on your most recent filing  of SBA Form 468, of any investments in the Equity Securities of a  Smaller Enterprise located in a low-income geographic area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the amount that equals 50 percent of your  Leverageable Capital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subtract from your outstanding Leverage the lesser of  paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) is less than  the maximum leverage determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the  difference between the two amounts equals your additional Leverage  availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section, and a maximum Leverage amount of $250,000,000 for the  $225,000,000 set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, if you satisfy  the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 50 percent (in dollars) of your Financings preceding  the date of such request must have been invested in Small Businesses  located in low-income geographic areas. In addition, you must certify  that at least 50 percent (in dollars) of your Financings on or after the  date of such request will be invested in Small Businesses located in  low-income geographic areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you are requesting a draw that would cause you and any other  Licensees under Common Control to have aggregate outstanding Leverage in  excess of $225,000,000, at least 50 percent (in dollars) of the  Financings made by each Licensee under Common Control preceding the date  of such request must have been invested in Small Businesses located in  low-income geographic areas. In addition, each such Licensee must  certify that at least 50 percent (in dollars) of its Financings on or  after the date of such request will be invested in Small Businesses  located in low-income geographic areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional Leverage based on Energy Saving Qualified Investments  in Smaller Enterprises. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you  were licensed on or after October 1, 2008, you may have outstanding  Leverage in excess of the amounts permitted by paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section in accordance with this paragraph (e). Any investment that  you use as a basis to seek additional Leverage under this paragraph (e)  cannot also be used to seek additional Leverage under paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine whether you may request a draw that would cause you  to have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amount determined under  paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the cost basis, as reported on your most recent filing  of SBA Form 468, of any Energy Saving   Qualified Investments in a Smaller Enterprise that individually do not  exceed 20% of your Regulatory Capital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the amount that equals 33% of your Leverageable  Capital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subtract from your outstanding Leverage the lesser of  paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) is less than  the maximum Leverage determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the  difference between the two amounts equals your additional Leverage  availability.
