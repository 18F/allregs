Applications which fail to comply with this requirement, whether or not accompanied by a petition to amend the Table, will not be accepted for filing. However, applications specifying channels which accord with publicly announced FCC Orders changing the Table of Allotments will be accepted for filing even though such applications are tendered before the effective dates of such channel changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an application may be filed for a channel or community not listed in the TV Table of Allotments if it is consistent with the rules and policies established in the Third Report and Order in WT Docket 99-168 (FCC 01-25), adopted January 18, 2001. Where such a request is approved, the Media Bureau will change the Table of Allotments to reflect that approval.
