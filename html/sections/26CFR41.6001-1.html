Such records shall show with respect to each such vehicle:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the vehicle (including serial number or manufacturer's number) in sufficient detail to permit positive identification of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The weight of the loads carried by the vehicle in such form as is required under the laws of any State in which the vehicle is registered or required to be registered, in order to permit verification of such vehicle's taxable gross weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of any such vehicle acquired after June 30, 1956, the date on which such person acquired such vehicle and the name and address of the person from whom the vehicle was acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The first month of each taxable period in which occurred a taxable use of each such vehicle while the vehicle was registered in the name of such person; information showing whether such vehicle was operated, while registered in the name of such person, in any prior month in such taxable period; and if such vehicle was so operated, evidence establishing that such operation was not a taxable use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date of sale or other transfer to another of any such vehicle, together with the name and address of the person to whom transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of any such vehicle disposed of otherwise than by sale or other transfer (including disposition by theft or destruction), the date and method of disposition of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In the case of a secondhand highway motor vehicle acquired at any time in the taxable period, evidence showing whether there was a prior taxable use in such taxable period of the highway motor vehicle (see paragraph (b) of Sec. 41.4481-2) or whether there was a suspension of tax in effect (see Sec. 41.4483-3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A copy of each return, schedule, statement, or other document filed, pursuant to the regulations in this part or in accordance with the instructions applicable to any form prescribed thereunder, by the person required to keep such records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transit systems.

The owner of a highway motor vehicle who reasonably expects the vehicle to be exempt from the tax under section 4481(a) by reason of Sec. 41.4483-3(c) for a given taxable period shall keep records which indicate the reason that the use of the vehicle is not expected to exceed 5,000 miles on public highways.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records of claimants. Any person claiming refund, credit, or abatement of the tax, interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty, shall keep a complete and detailed record with respect to the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Place and period for keeping records. (1) All records required by the regulations in this part shall be kept, by the person required to keep them, at a convenient and safe location within the United States which is accessible to internal revenue officers. Such records shall at all times be available for inspection by such officers. If such person has a principal place of business in the United States, the records shall be kept at such place of business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All records required by the regulations in this part shall be kept, by the person required to keep them, at a convenient and safe location within the United States which is accessible to internal revenue officers.
