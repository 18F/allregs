                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals desiring to know if a specific system of records  maintained by SIGAR contains a record pertaining to them should address  their inquiries to the Privacy Officer, Special Inspector General for  Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As  there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the  request via facsimile to (703) 601-3804 or by email to  sigar.pentagon.gen-coun.mbx.privacy@mail.mil. The written inquiry should  contain a specific reference to the system of records maintained by the  SIGAR listed in the SIGAR Notice of Systems of Records, or it should  describe the type of record in sufficient detail reasonably to identify  the system of records. Notice of SIGAR systems of records subject to the  Privacy Act will be published in the Federal Register, posted on the  SIGAR public facing Web site, and copies of the notices will be  available upon request to the Privacy Officer when so published. A  compilation of such notices will also be made and published by the  Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At a minimum, the request should contain sufficient identifying  information to allow SIGAR to determine if there is a record pertaining  to the individual making the request in a particular system of records.  In instances when the requester's identification is insufficient to  ensure disclosure to the individual to whom the information pertains in  view of the sensitivity of the information, SIGAR reserves the right to  solicit from the person requesting access to a record additional  identifying information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ordinarily the person requesting will be informed whether the  named system of records contains a record pertaining to such person  within 10 days of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal  Federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference the  procedures which must be followed by the individual making the request  in order to gain access to the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a response cannot be made within the 10 days, the  Privacy Officer will inform the person making the request the reasons  for the delay and the date on which a response may be anticipated.</p>
