                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where refrigerating machines are installed in which anhydrous  ammonia is used as a refrigerant, such machines shall be located in a  well-ventilated, isolated compartment, preferably on the deck, but in no  case shall it be permissible to install such machines in the engineroom  space unless the arrangement is such as to eliminate any hazard from gas  escaping to the engineroom. Absorption machines using a solution of aqua  ammonia and machines using carbon dioxide are exempt from this  requirement, provided the maximum charges that might be released in the  event of breakage do not exceed 300 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Machinery compartments containing equipment for ammonia shall be  fitted with a sprinkler system providing an effective water spray and  having a remote control device located outside the compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All refrigeration compressor spaces shall be effectively  ventilated   and drained and shall be separated from the insulated spaces by a  watertight bulkhead, unless otherwise approved.
