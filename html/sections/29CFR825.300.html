                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every employer covered by the FMLA is  required to post and keep posted on its premises, in conspicuous places  where employees   are employed, a notice explaining the Act's provisions and providing  information concerning the procedures for filing complaints of  violations of the Act with the Wage and Hour Division. The notice must  be posted prominently where it can be readily seen by employees and  applicants for employment. The poster and the text must be large enough  to be easily read and contain fully legible text. Electronic posting is  sufficient to meet this posting requirement as long as it otherwise  meets the requirements of this section. An employer that willfully  violates the posting requirement may be assessed a civil money penalty  by the Wage and Hour Division not to exceed $110 for each separate  offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Covered employers must post this general notice even if no  employees are eligible for FMLA leave.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an FMLA-covered employer has any eligible employees, it shall  also provide this general notice to each employee by including the  notice in employee handbooks or other written guidance to employees  concerning employee benefits or leave rights, if such written materials  exist, or by distributing a copy of the general notice to each new  employee upon hiring. In either case, distribution may be accomplished  electronically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  employers may duplicate the text of the Department's prototype notice  (WHD Publication 1420) or may use another format so long as the  information provided includes, at a minimum, all of the information  contained in that notice. Where an employer's workforce is comprised of  a significant portion of workers who are not literate in English, the  employer shall provide the general notice in a language in which the  employees are literate. Prototypes are available from the nearest office  of the Wage and Hour Division or on the Internet at www.dol.gov/whd.  Employers furnishing FMLA notices to sensory-impaired individuals must  also comply with all applicable requirements under Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an employee requests FMLA leave, or  when the employer acquires knowledge that an employee's leave may be for  an FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the employee of the  employee's eligibility to take FMLA leave within five business days,  absent extenuating circumstances. See Sec. 825.110 for definition of an  eligible employee and Sec. 825.801 for special hours of service  eligibility requirements for airline flight crews. Employee eligibility  is determined (and notice must be provided) at the commencement of the  first instance of leave for each FMLA-qualifying reason in the  applicable 12-month period. See Sec. Sec. 825.127(c) and 825.200(b).  All FMLA absences for the same qualifying reason are considered a single  leave and employee eligibility as to that reason for leave does not  change during the applicable 12-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The eligibility notice must state whether the employee is  eligible for FMLA leave as defined in Sec. 825.110. If the employee is  not eligible for FMLA leave, the notice must state at least one reason  why the employee is not eligible, including as applicable the number of  months the employee has been employed by the employer, the hours of  service with the employer during the 12-month period, and whether the  employee is employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees are  employed by the employer within 75 miles of that worksite. Notification  of eligibility may be oral or in writing; employers may use optional  Form WH-381 (Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibility) to  provide such notification to employees. Prototypes are available from  the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division or on the Internet at  www.dol.gov/whd. The employer is obligated to translate this notice in  any situation in which it is obligated to do so in Sec. 825.300(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, at the time an employee provides notice of a subsequent need  for FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period due to a different  FMLA-qualifying reason, and the employee's eligibility status has not  changed, no additional eligibility notice is required. If, however, the  employee's eligibility status has changed (e.g., if the employee has not  met the hours of service requirement in the 12 months preceding the  commencement of leave for the subsequent qualifying reason or   the size of the workforce at the worksite has dropped below 50  employees), the employer must notify the employee of the change in  eligibility status within five business days, absent extenuating  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rights and responsibilities notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employers shall provide  written notice detailing the specific expectations and obligations of  the employee and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these  obligations. The employer is obligated to translate this notice in any  situation in which it is obligated to do so in Sec. 825.300(a)(4). This  notice shall be provided to the employee each time the eligibility  notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. If leave  has already begun, the notice should be mailed to the employee's address  of record. Such specific notice must include, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the leave may be designated and counted against the  employee's annual FMLA leave entitlement if qualifying (see Sec. Sec.  825.300(c) and 825.301) and the applicable 12-month period for FMLA  entitlement (see Sec. Sec. 825.127(c), 825.200(b), (f), and (g));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any requirements for the employee to furnish certification of a  serious health condition, serious injury or illness, or qualifying  exigency arising out of covered active duty or call to covered active  duty status, and the consequences of failing to do so (see Sec. Sec.  825.305, 825.309, 825.310, 825.313);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee's right to substitute paid leave, whether the  employer will require the substitution of paid leave, the conditions  related to any substitution, and the employee's entitlement to take  unpaid FMLA leave if the employee does not meet the conditions for paid  leave (see Sec. 825.207);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any requirement for the employee to make any premium payments  to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for making such  payments (see Sec. 825.210), and the possible consequences of failure  to make such payments on a timely basis (i.e., the circumstances under  which coverage may lapse);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The employee's status as a key employee and the potential  consequence that restoration may be denied following FMLA leave,  explaining the conditions required for such denial (see Sec. 825.218);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The employee's rights to maintenance of benefits during the  FMLA leave and restoration to the same or an equivalent job upon return  from FMLA leave (see Sec. Sec. 825.214 and 825.604); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The employee's potential liability for payment of health  insurance premiums paid by the employer during the employee's unpaid  FMLA leave if the employee fails to return to work after taking FMLA  leave (see Sec. 825.213).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice of rights and responsibilities may include other  information--e.g., whether the employer will require periodic reports of  the employee's status and intent to return to work--but is not required  to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The notice of rights and responsibilities may be accompanied by  any required certification form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the specific information provided by the notice of rights and  responsibilities changes, the employer shall, within five business days  of receipt of the employee's first notice of need for leave subsequent  to any change, provide written notice referencing the prior notice and  setting forth any of the information in the notice of rights and  responsibilities that has changed. For example, if the initial leave  period was paid leave and the subsequent leave period would be unpaid  leave, the employer may need to give notice of the arrangements for  making premium payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employers are also expected to responsively answer questions  from employees concerning their rights and responsibilities under the  FMLA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A prototype notice of rights and responsibilities may be  obtained from local offices of the Wage and Hour Division or from the  Internet at www.dol.gov/whd. Employers may adapt the prototype notice as  appropriate to meet these notice requirements. The notice of rights and  responsibilities may be distributed electronically so long as it  otherwise meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Designation notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer is responsible in all  circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying, and for giving  notice of the designation to the employee as   provided in this section. When the employer has enough information to  determine whether the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason  (e.g., after receiving a certification), the employer must notify the  employee whether the leave will be designated and will be counted as  FMLA leave within five business days absent extenuating circumstances.  Only one notice of designation is required for each FMLA-qualifying  reason per applicable 12-month period, regardless of whether the leave  taken due to the qualifying reason will be a continuous block of leave  or intermittent or reduced schedule leave. If the employer determines  that the leave will not be designated as FMLA-qualifying (e.g., if the  leave is not for a reason covered by FMLA or the FMLA leave entitlement  has been exhausted), the employer must notify the employee of that  determination. If the employer requires paid leave to be substituted for  unpaid FMLA leave, or that paid leave taken under an existing leave plan  be counted as FMLA leave, the employer must inform the employee of this  designation at the time of designating the FMLA leave.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employer has sufficient information to designate the  leave as FMLA leave immediately after receiving notice of the employee's  need for leave, the employer may provide the employee with the  designation notice at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the employer will require the employee to present a fitness- for-duty certification to be restored to employment, the employer must  provide notice of such requirement with the designation notice. If the  employer will require that the fitness-for-duty certification address  the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the  employee's position, the employer must so indicate in the designation  notice, and must include a list of the essential functions of the  employee's position. See Sec. 825.312. If the employer handbook or  other written documents (if any) describing the employer's leave  policies clearly provide that a fitness-for-duty certification will be  required in specific circumstances (e.g., by stating that fitness-for- duty certification will be required in all cases of back injuries for  employees in a certain occupation), the employer is not required to  provide written notice of the requirement with the designation notice,  but must provide oral notice no later than with the designation notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation notice must be in writing. A prototype  designation notice may be obtained from local offices of the Wage and  Hour Division or from the Internet at www.dol.gov/whd. If the leave is  not designated as FMLA leave because it does not meet the requirements  of the Act, the notice to the employee that the leave is not designated  as FMLA leave may be in the form of a simple written statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the information provided by the employer to the employee in  the designation notice changes (e.g., the employee exhausts the FMLA  leave entitlement), the employer shall provide, within five business  days of receipt of the employee's first notice of need for leave  subsequent to any change, written notice of the change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer must notify the employee of the amount of leave  counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. If the amount of  leave needed is known at the time the employer designates the leave as  FMLA-qualifying, the employer must notify the employee of the number of  hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the employee's FMLA  leave entitlement in the designation notice. If it is not possible to  provide the hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the  employee's FMLA leave entitlement (such as in the case of unforeseeable  intermittent leave), then the employer must provide notice of the amount  of leave counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement upon the  request by the employee, but no more often than once in a 30-day period  and only if leave was taken in that period. The notice of the amount of  leave counted against the employee's FMLA entitlement may be oral or in  writing. If such notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in writing, no  later than the following payday (unless the payday is less than one week  after the oral notice, in which case the notice must be no later than  the subsequent payday). Such written notice may be in any form,  including a notation on the employee's pay stub.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to follow the  notice requirements set forth in this section may constitute an  interference with, restraint, or denial of the exercise of an employee's  FMLA rights. An employer may be liable for compensation and benefits  lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses  sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate  equitable or other relief, including employment, reinstatement,  promotion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered See Sec.  825.400(c).</p>
