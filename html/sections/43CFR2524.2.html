                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Extension of time. Inasmuch as entrymen are allowed 1 year after  entry in which to submit the first annual proof of expenditures for the  purpose of improving and reclaiming the land entered by them, the  privileges of the Act of June 27, 1906, are not necessary in connection  with annual proofs until the expiration of the years in which such  proofs are due. Therefore, if at the time that annual proof is due it  can not be made, on account of hindrance or delay occasioned by a  withdrawal of the land for the purpose indicated in the act, the  applicant will file his statement explaining the delay. As a rule,  however, annual proofs may be made, notwithstanding the withdrawal of  the land, because expenditures for various kinds of improvements are  allowed as satisfactory annual proofs. Therefore an extension of time  for making annual proof will not be granted unless it is made clearly to  appear that the entryman has been delayed or prevented by the withdrawal  from making the required improvements; and, unless he has been so  hindered or prevented from making the required improvements, no  application for extension of time for making final proof will be granted  until after all the yearly proofs have been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When application for extension of time should be filed. An  entryman will not need to invoke the privileges of the Act of June 27,  1906, in connection with final proof until such final proof is due, and  if at that time he is unable to make the final proof of reclamation and  cultivation, as required by law, and such inability is due, directly or  indirectly, to the withdrawal of the land on account of a reclamation  project, the statement explaining the hindrance and delay should be  filed in order that the entryman may be excused for such failure.</p>
