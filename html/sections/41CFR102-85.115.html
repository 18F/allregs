                            <p class="depth0">Unless an exemption is granted under the authority of the  Administrator of General Services, the Rent charged approximates  commercial charges for comparable space and space-related services as  follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally, Rent for Federally owned space provided by GSA is  based on market appraisals of fully serviced rental values for the  predominant use to which space in a building is put; e.g., general use,  warehouse use, and parking use. In cases where market appraisals are not  practical; e.g., in cases involving unique space or when market  comparables are not available, GSA may establish Rent on the basis of  alternate commercial practices. See the discussion of alternate  valuation methods in Sec. 102-85.125. Amortization of tenant  improvements, parking fees, and security charges are calculated  separately and added to the appraised shell Rent to establish the Rent  charge. Customer agencies also pay for a pro rata share of joint use  space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, Rent for space leased by GSA is based on the actual  cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided  by the lessor, plus a GSA fee, and security charges and parking (if not  in the lease).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Rent is based on the terms and conditions of the OA,  starting with the shell Rent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the shell Rent, the Rent includes amortization of  TI allowances used, real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services,  parking, GSA fee for its services, and charges for security, joint-use,  and other applicable rental charges (e.g., antenna site, land,  wareyard).</p>
