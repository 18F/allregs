                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Internal Revenue Service may reimburse a State  or local law enforcement agency for expenses, such as salaries, overtime  pay, per diem, and similar reasonable expenses, incurred in an  investigation in which information is furnished to the Service that  substantially contributes to the recovery of Federal taxes imposed with  respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities. The  amount of reimbursement that may be paid shall not exceed the limits  specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information that substantially contributes to recovery of  taxes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. The Service generally will consider that  information furnished by a State or local law enforcement agency  substantially contributed to the recovery of taxes with respect to  illegal drug or related money laundering activities provided the  information was not already in the possession of the Service at the time  the information is furnished by the State or local law enforcement  agency, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Concerns a taxpayer who is not under examination or  investigation by the Service at the time the information is furnished or  has not already been selected by the Service for examination or  investigation in the near future, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Concerns a taxpayer who is under examination or has been  selected for examination at the time the information is furnished but  the information furnished would not normally have been discovered in the  course of an ordinary investigation or examination by the Service. Also,  information will generally be considered as substantially contributing  to the recovery of taxes if it leads to the discovery of hidden assets  owned by the taxpayer which are   used to satisfy the taxpayer's assessed but otherwise uncollectible  Federal tax liability with respect to illegal drug or related money  laundering activities.  For purposes of this paragraph (b), information includes, but is not  limited to, tax years of violations, aliases, addresses, social security  numbers and/or employer identification numbers, financial data (bank  accounts, assets, etc.) and their location, and any documentation that  substantiates allegations concerning tax liability (books and records)  and its location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A local police department's narcotics division has been  gathering information on a suspected local drug dealer for approximately  six months. Because this person is very cautious when handling  narcotics, the local police have been unsuccessful in catching this  person in possession of drugs. Rather than drop the case, the narcotics  detective turns over to the local IRS Criminal Investigation Division  (CID) office information concerning this person. At the time the  information is furnished, the Service is unaware of this person's  suspected involvement in drugs and has no reason to suspect that this  person's Federal income tax returns are incorrect. Upon examination of  this person's returns for three open years, the Service determines that  additional Federal income taxes and civil penalties of approximately  $20,000 per year are due because of unreported income from drug dealing.  Because the taxpayer was not under examination and was not reasonably  anticipated to have been examined prior to receipt of the information,  the Service will consider that the information furnished by the local  police department substantially contributed to the recovery of  approximately $60,000 in taxes with respect to illegal drug activities.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as example 1 except that at the  time the information is turned over to the Service, the Service was  already aware of the extent of this person's involvement in drug  dealing, either through information developed in the course of  examinations of other taxpayers or through information received from  other sources, and had already selected this person's returns for  examination although the person had not yet been contacted by the  Service. In this case, the information provided by the local police  department did not substantially contribute to the recovery of taxes  from this person because the information was already known to the  Service.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A state or local police officer is conducting ordinary  traffic patrol. The officer stops a vehicle for speeding and reckless  driving. The officer recognizes the driver as a known narcotics dealer.  In the vehicle is a brief case containing $75,000 in cash, but no trace  of narcotics is found. The driver claims the cash was won in a high  stakes poker game. The officer arrests the driver for traffic violations  and takes the briefcase into custody for safe keeping. The local police  department cannot seize the money because they cannot tie it to a  narcotics transaction. Instead, they immediately inform the local CID  office of their find. At the time this information is furnished to the  Service, there is an unpaid assessed liability of $300,000 in Federal  taxes and penalties owed by the dealer with respect to illegal drug  activities that the Service has been unable to collect. Therefore, the  Service immediately seizes the $75,000 in cash in partial payment of the  tax liability. The Service will consider that the information furnished  by the police department substantially contributed to the recovery of  $75,000 in taxes with respect to drug related activities.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Through information furnished by a reliable informant, a  local police department learns that a known racketeer and suspected drug  dealer maintains a second set of books and records in a safe at home.  The local police obtain a search warrant and find a set of books  revealing that this person has been using a legitimate business  operation to launder money derived from both prostitution and drug  dealing. At the time these records are turned over to the local CID  office, the taxpayer is already under examination for tax evasion.  However, based on the information contained in this second set of books,  the Service is able to collect additional taxes and civil penalties in  the amount of $1 million in connection with these illegal activities.  The Service will consider that this information substantially  contributed to the recovery of $1 million in taxes with respect to money  laundering in connection with illegal drug activities because, even  though the taxpayer was already under examination, the information  provided by the local police would normally not have been discovered by  the Service in the course of an ordinary investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application for reimbursement. An agency that intends to apply  for reimbursement under the provisions of this section must indicate  this intent to the Service at the time the information is first provided  to the Service. A final application for reimbursement of expenses must  be submitted on Form 211A, State or Local Law Enforcement Application  for Reimbursement, to the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division of the  Internal Revenue Service district in which the taxpayer is located.  Copies of Forms 9061, DAG-71, or other   claim for an equitable share of asset forfeitures in the case must also  be furnished with Form 211A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for filing application for reimbursement. An application  for reimbursement may be filed by an agency at the time the information  is first provided or as soon as practicable after submitting information  to the Service. However, it must be filed not later than 30 days after  the Service notifies the agency pursuant to section 7624(b) of the  amount of taxes collected as a result of the information provided. If an  application for reimbursement is filed by more than one agency with  respect to taxes recovered from a taxpayer, the Service will use  discretion in determining an equitable amount of reimbursement allocated  to each agency based on all relevant factors. In no event, however,  shall the aggregate of the amounts paid by the Service to two or more  agencies exceed the amount specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amount and payment of reimbursement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> De minimis rule. No  reimbursement shall be paid under section 7624 or this section to a  State or local law enforcement agency in any case where the taxes  recovered total less than $50,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxes recovered. For purposes of section 7624 and this section,  the terms ``taxes'' recovered and ``sum'' recovered mean additional  Federal taxes, civil penalties, and additions to tax collected (less any  subsequent refund to the taxpayer) with respect to illegal drug or  related money laundering activities, but not additional interest or  criminal fines that may be collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on reimbursement. The amount of reimbursement payable  under section 7624 and this section shall not exceed 10 percent of any  taxes recovered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No duplicate reimbursement. A State or local law emforcement  agency shall not receive reimbursement under section 7624 or this  section for any expenses incurred in the investigation of a taxpayer  which have been or will be reimbursed under any other program or  arrangement including, but not limited to, Federal or State forfeiture  programs, State revenue laws, or Federal and State equitable sharing  arrangements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Time of payment. No payment of any reimbursement under this  section will be made to a State or local law enforcement agency before  the later of final expiration of the applicable period of limitations  for filing a claim for refund by the taxpayer of the taxes recovered as  provided in subchapter B of chapter 66 of the Code or the determination  of the taxpayer's tax liability, as defined in section 1313(a). However,  reimbursement may be made earlier but only if the agency provides  adequate indemnification against loss by the Service due to a refund to  the taxpayer of Federal taxes recovered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Applicability. The provisions of section 7624 apply only to  State and local law enforcement agencies within the United States and  the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section applies with respect to information  first provided to the Service by a State or local law enforcement agency  after February 16, 1989.
