                            <p class="depth0">The act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210; 25 U.S.C. 387) creates a first lien against irrigable lands under all Indian irrigation projects where the construction, operation and maintenance costs of such projects remain unpaid and are reimbursable, and directs that such lien shall be recited in any patent or instrument issued for such lands to cover such unpaid charges. Prior to the enactment of this legislation similar liens had been created by legislative authority against irrigable lands of the projects on the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and Gila River Reservations, in Arizona; Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, Fort Belknap, and Crow Reservations, Mont.; Wapato project, Yakima Reservation, Wash.; the irrigable lands on the Colville Reservation within the West Okanogan irrigation district, Washington, and the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho. This legislation, therefore, extends protection similar to that existing in the legislation applicable to the projects on the reservations above mentioned.</p><p class="depth0">Cross References: For operation and maintenance charges and construction costs, see parts 134 and 137 of this chapter.</p>
