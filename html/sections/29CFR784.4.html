                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part contain the official interpretations of  the Department of Labor pertaining to the exemptions provided in  sections 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,  as amended. It is intended that the positions stated will serve as ``a  practical guide to employers and employees as to how the office  representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply  it'' (Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 138). These interpretations  indicate the construction of the law which the Secretary of Labor and  the Administrator believe to be correct and which will guide them in the  performance of their duties under the Act, unless and until they are  otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts or conclude  upon re-examination of an interpretation that it is incorrect. The  interpretations contained herein may be relied upon in accordance with  section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C. 251-262), so long as  they remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded, or  determined by judicial authority to be incorrect.</p>
