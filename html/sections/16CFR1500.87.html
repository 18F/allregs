                                Sec. 1500.87  Children's products containing lead: inaccessible
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the CPSIA  provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended  primarily for children 12 and younger may not contain more than 600 ppm  of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or   intended primarily for children 12 and younger cannot contain more than  300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit may be further reduced to  100 ppm after three years, unless the Commission determines that it is  not technologically feasible to have this lower limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of the CPSIA provides that the lead limits do  not apply to component parts of a product that are not accessible to a  child. This section specifies that a component part is not accessible if  it is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing  and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable  use and abuse of the product including swallowing, mouthing, breaking,  or other children's activities, and the aging of the product, as  determined by the Commission. Paint, coatings, or electroplating may not  be considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the substrate to  be inaccessible to a child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 101(b)(2)(B) of the CPSIA directs the Commission to  promulgate by August 14, 2009, this interpretative rule to provide  guidance with respect to what product components or classes of  components will be considered to be inaccessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The accessibility probes specified for sharp points or edges  under the Commissions' regulations at 16 CFR 1500.48-1500.49 will be  used to assess the accessibility of lead-component parts of a children's  product. A lead-containing component part would be considered accessible  if it can be contacted by any portion of the specified segment of the  accessibility probe. A lead-containing component part would be  considered inaccessible if it cannot be contacted by any portion of the  specified segment of the accessibility probe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For products intended for children that are 18 months of age or  less, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's  regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.51 (excluding the bite  test of Sec. 1500.51(c)), will be used to evaluate accessibility of  lead-containing component parts of a children's product as a result of  normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For products intended for children that are over 18 months but  not over 36 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the  Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.52 (excluding  the bite test of Sec. 1500.52(c)), will be used to evaluate  accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product  as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the  product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For products intended for children that are over 36 months but  not over 96 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the  Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding  the bite test of Sec. 1500.53(c)), will be used to evaluate  accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product  as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the  product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For products intended for children over 96 months through 12  years of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's  regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding the bite  test of Sec. 1500.53(c)) intended for children aged 37-96 months will  be used to evaluate accessibility of lead-containing component parts of  a children's product as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable  use and abuse of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A children's product that is or contains a lead-containing part  which is enclosed, encased, or covered by fabric and passes the  appropriate use and abuse tests on such covers, is inaccessible to a  child unless the product or part of the product in one dimension is  smaller than 5 centimeters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The intentional disassembly or destruction of products by  children older than age 8 years by means or knowledge not generally  available to younger children, including use of tools, will not be  considered in evaluating products for accessibility of lead-containing  components.
