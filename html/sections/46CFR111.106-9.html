Enclosed areas containing devices handling cargoes, such as  cargo handling or pump rooms, except as modified by Sec.  111.106-13 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interiors of cargo storage tanks, slop tanks, any pressure- relief pipework or other venting systems for cargo and slop tanks, pipes  and equipment containing the cargo or developing flammable gases or  vapors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Areas on an open deck, or a semi-enclosed space on an open deck,  within 0.5 meters of any cargo storage tank outlet, cargo gas or vapor  outlet, ullage opening, sounding pipe, cargo tank opening for pressure  release, or cargo storage tank pressure or vacuum valve provided to  permit the flow of small volumes of gas or vapor mixtures caused by  thermal variation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Areas on an open deck, or semi-enclosed spaces on open deck,  within 0.5 meters of any cargo handling or pump room entrance, or cargo  ventilation handling or pump room ventilation inlet or outlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Areas in the vicinity of any cargo vent outlet for free flow of  large volumes of vapor mixtures during cargo loading and discharging of  storage tanks, within a vertical cylinder of unlimited height, of 1  meter radius centered upon the vent outlet, and within a hemisphere of  1-meter radius below the vent outlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Areas in the vicinity of any cargo high-velocity vent outlet  during cargo loading and discharging of storage tanks, within a vertical  cylinder of unlimited height, of 0.5 meters radius centered upon the  vent outlet, and within a hemisphere of 0.5 meters radius below the vent  outlet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following are Class I Division 1

cargo valve, cargo  pipe flange, cargo tank hatch, sight port, tank cleaning opening, and  opening into cofferdams or other Zone 1 spaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regardless of the level of natural ventilation, areas on an open  deck above the tank top of each cargo tank extending out 3 meters beyond  the tank top boundaries of each cargo tank, up to a height of 2.4 meters  above the deck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Areas on an open deck within spillage coamings surrounding cargo  manifold valves extending 3 meters beyond the boundaries of the spillage  coamings, up to a height of 2.4 meters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A void space or an enclosed space immediately above, below or  adjacent to an integral cargo storage tank, including cofferdams and  permanent (for example, segregated) ballast tanks adjacent to integral  cargo storage tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A hold space containing an independent cargo storage tank.</p><p

class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Areas 7.5 meters beyond the cylinder and 7.5 meters beyond the  hemisphere of the Class I Special Division 1 (Zone 0) hazardous  locations cited in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Areas 5.5 meters beyond the cylinder and 5.5 meters beyond the  hemisphere of the Class I Special Division 1 (Zone 0) hazardous  locations cited in
