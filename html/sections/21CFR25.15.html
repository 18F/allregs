                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All applications or petitions requesting agency action require the submission of an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion. A claim of categorical exclusion shall include a statement of compliance with the categorical exclusion criteria and shall state that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist. Failure to submit an adequate EA for an application or petition requesting action by the agency of a type specified in Sec. 25.20, unless the agency can determine that the action qualifies for exclusion under Sec. Sec. 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, or 25.34, is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve the application or petition. An EA adequate for filing is one that addresses the relevant environmental issues. An EA adequate for approval is one that contains sufficient information to enable the agency to determine whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The responsible agency officials will evaluate the information contained in the EA to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and whether an EIS will be prepared. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are identified, FDA will prepare an EIS for the action in accordance with the procedures in subparts D and E of this part. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are not identified, resulting in a decision not to prepare an EIS, the responsible agency official will prepare a FONSI in accordance with Sec. 25.41.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classes of actions that individually or cumulatively do not significantly affect the quality of the human environment ordinarily are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or an EIS. The classes of actions that qualify as categorical exclusions are set forth in Sec. Sec. 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, or 25.34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A person submitting an application or petition of a type subject to categorical exclusion under Sec. Sec. 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, or 25.34, or proposing to dispose of an article as provided in Sec. 25.30(d) or 25.32(h), is not required to submit an EA if the person states that the action requested qualifies for a categorical exclusion, citing the particular categorical exclusion that is claimed, and states that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist.</p>
