Secretary's interpretation of federal law requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. The Secretary interprets section 3304(a)(1) of the Federal  Unemployment Tax Act and section 303(a)(2) of the Social Security Act to  require that a State law provide for payment of unemployment  compensation solely through public employment offices or claims offices  administered by the State employment security agency if such agency  provides for such coordination in the operations of its public  employment offices and claims offices as will insure (a) the payment of  benefits only to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work  and available for work, and (b) that individuals claiming unemployment  compensation (claimants) are afforded such placement and other  employment services as are necessary and appropriate to return them to  suitable work as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Secretary interprets all the above sections to require that a  State law provide for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> as will reasonably insure the payment of  unemployment compensation only to individuals who are unemployed and who  are able to work and available for work, and (2) that claimants are  afforded such placement and other employment services as are necessary  and appropriate to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as  possible; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Methods of administration which do not unreasonably limit the  opportunity of individuals to establish their right to unemployment  compensation due under such States law.</p><p class="depth0">5001 Claim Filing and Claimant Reporting Requirements Designed To</p><p class="depth0">Satisfy Secretary's Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">A. Claim filing--total or part-total unemployment</p><p class="depth0">1. Individuals claiming unemployment compensation for total or part- total unemployment are required to file a claim weekly or biweekly, in  person or by mail, at a public employment office or a claims office  (these terms include offices at itinerant points) as set forth below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, a claimant is required to file  in person.</p><p class="depth0">a. His new claim with respect to a benefit year, or his continued  claim for a waiting week or for his first compensable week of  unemployment in such year; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Any other claim, when requested to do so by the claims personnel  at the office at which he files his claim(s) because questions about his  right to benefits are raised by circumstances such as the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The conditions or circumstances of his separation from  employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The claimant's answers to questions on mail claim(s) indicate  that he may be unable to work or that there may be undue restrictions on  his availability for work or that his search for work may be inadequate  or that he may be disqualified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The claimant's answers to questions on mail claims create  uncertainty about his credibility or indicate a lack of understanding of  the applicable requirements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The claimant's record shows that he has previously filed a  fraudulent claim.</p><p class="depth0">In such circumstances, the claimant is required to continue to file  claims in person each week (or biweekly) until the State agency  determines that filing claims in person is no longer required for the  resolution of such questions.</p><p class="depth0">3. A claimant must be permitted to file a claim by mail in any of  the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0">a. He is located in an area requiring the expenditure of an  unreasonable amount of time or money in traveling to the nearest  facility established by the State agency for filing claims in person;</p><p class="depth0">b. Conditions make it impracticable for the agency to take claims in  person;</p><p class="depth0">c. He has returned to full-time work on or before the scheduled date  for his filing a claim, unless the agency makes provision for in-person  filing at a time and place that does not interfere with his employment;</p><p class="depth0">d. The agency finds that he has good cause for failing to file a  claim in person.</p><p class="depth0">4. A claimant who has been receiving benefits for partial  unemployment may continue to file claims as if he were a partially  unemployed worker for the first four consecutive weeks of total or part- total unemployment immediately following his period of partial  unemployment so long as he remains attached to his regular employer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Claim filing--partial unemployment. Each individual claiming  unemployment compensation for a week (or other claim period) during  which, because of lack of work, he is working less than his normal  customary full-time hours for his regular employer and is earning less  than the earnings limit provided in the State law, shall not be required  to file a claim for such week or other claim period earlier than 2 weeks  from the date that wages are paid for such claim period or, if a low  earnings report is required by the State law, from the date the employer  furnished such report to the individual. State agencies may permit  claims for partial unemployment to be filed either in person or by mail,  except that in the circumstances set forth in section A 3, filing by  mail must be permitted, and in the circumstances set forth in section A  2 b, filing in person may be required.</p><p class="depth0">5002 Requirement for Job Finding, Placement, and Other Employment</p><p class="depth0">Services Designed To Satisfy Secretary's Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">A. Claims personnel are required to assure that each claimant is  doing what a reasonable individual in his circumstances would do to  obtain suitable work.</p><p class="depth0">B. In the discretion of the State agency:</p><p class="depth0">1. The claims personnel are required to give each claimant such  necessary and appropriate assistance as they reasonably can in finding  suitable work and at their discretion determine when more complete  placement and employment services are necessary and appropriate for a  claimant; and if they determine more complete services are necessary and  appropriate, the claims personnel are to refer him to employment service  personnel in the public employment office in which he has been filing  claim(s), or, if he has been filing in a claims office, in the public  employment office most accessible to him; or</p><p class="depth0">2. All placement and employment services are required to be afforded  to each claimant by employment service personnel in the public  employment office most accessible to him in which case the claims  personnel in the office in which the claimant files his claim are to  refer him to the employment service personnel when placement or other  employment services are necessary and appropriate for him.</p><p class="depth0">C. The personnel to whom the State agency assigns the  responsibilities outlined in paragraph B above are required to give  claimants such job-finding assistance, placement, and other employment  services as are necessary and appropriate to facilitate their return to  suitable work as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">In some circumstances, no such services or only limited services may  be required. For example, if a claimant is on a short-term temporary  layoff with a fixed return date, the only service necessary and  appropriate to be given to him during the period of the layoff is a  referral to suitable temporary work if such work is being performed in  the labor market area.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, claimants whose unemployment is caused by a labor dispute  presumably will return to work with their employer as soon as the labor  dispute is settled. They generally do not need services, nor do  individuals in occupations where placement customarily is made by other  nonfee charging placement facilities such as unions and professional  associations.</p><p class="depth0">Claimants who fall within the classes which ordinarily would require  limited services or no services shall, if they request placement and  employment services, be afforded such services as are necessary and  appropriate for them to obtain suitable work or to achieve their  reasonable employment goals.</p><p class="depth0">On the other hand, a claimant who is permanently separated from his  job is likely to require some services. He may need only some direction  in how to get a job; he may need placement services if he is in an  occupation for which there is some demand in the labor market area; if  his occupation is outdated, he may require counseling and referral to a  suitable training course. The extent and character of the services to be  given any particular claimant may change with the length of his  unemployment and depend not only on his own circumstances and  conditions, but also on the condition of the labor market in the area.</p><p class="depth0">D. Claimants are required to report to employment service personnel,  as directed, but such personnel and the claims personnel required to so  arrange and coordinate the contacts required of a claimant as not to  place an unreasonable burden on him or unreasonably limit his  opportunity to establish his rights to compensation. As a general rule,  a claimant is not required to contact in person claims personnel or  employment service personnel more frequently than once a week, unless he  is directed to report more frequently for a specific service such as  referral to a job or a training course or counseling which cannot be  completed in one visit.</p><p class="depth0">E. Employment service personnel are required to report promptly to  claims personnel in the office in which the claimant files his claim(s):  (1) his failure to apply for or accept work to which he was referred by  such personnel or when known, by any other nonfee-charging placement  facility such as a union or a professional association; and (2) any  information which becomes available to it that may have a bearing on the  claimant's ability to work or availability for work, or on the  suitability of work to which he was referred or which was offered to  him.</p><p class="depth0">5004 Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions</p><p class="depth0">If the State law provisions do not conform to the ``suggested State  law requirements'' set forth in sections 5001 and 5002, but the State  law contains alternative provisions, the Manpower Administrator, in  collaboration with the State agency, will study the actual or  anticipated affect of the alternative provisions. If the Manpower  Administrator concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy the  requirements of the Federal law as construed by the Secretary (see  section 5000 B) he will so notify the State agency. If he does not so  conclude, he will submit the matter to the Secretary. If the Secretary  concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy such requirements, the  State agency will be so notified. If the Secretary concludes that there  is a question as to whether the alternative provisions satisfy such  requirements, the State agency will be advised that unless the State law  provisions are appropriately revised, a notice of hearing will be issued  as required by the Code of Federal Regulations, title 20, section 601.3.

Section 303(a)(1) of the Social  Security Act requires that a State law include provision for:</p><p class="depth0">``Such methods of administration . . . as are found by the Secretary  to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment  compensation when due.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 303(a)(3) of the Social Security Act requires that a State  law include provision for:</p><p class="depth0">``Opportunity for a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal, for  all individuals whose claims for unemployment compensation are denied.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 3304(a)(4) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and section  303(a)(5) of the Social Security Act require that a State law include  provision for:</p><p class="depth0">``Expenditure of all money withdrawn from an unemployment fund of  such State, in the payment of unemployment compensation. . . .</p><p class="depth0">Section 3306(h) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act defines  ``compensation'' as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect  to their unemployment.''</p><p class="depth0">6011 Secretary's Interpretation of Federal Law Requirements. The  Secretary interprets the above sections to require that a State law  include provisions which will insure that:</p><p class="depth0">A. Individuals who may be entitled to unemployment compensation are  furnished such information as will reasonably afford them an opportunity  to know, establish, and protect their rights under the unemployment  compensation law of such State, and</p><p class="depth0">B. The State agency obtains and records in time for the prompt  determination and review of benefit claims such information as will  reasonably insure the payment of benefits to individuals to whom  benefits are due.</p><p class="depth0">6012 Criteria for Review of State Law Conformity with Federal  Requirements:</p><p class="depth0">In determining the conformity of a State law with the above  requirements of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and the Social Security  Act as interpreted by the Secretary, the following criteria will be  applied:</p><p class="depth0">A. Is it required that individuals who may be entitled to  unemployment compensation be furnished such information of their  potential rights to benefits, including the manner and places of filing  claims, the reasons for determinations, and their rights of appeal, as  will insure them a reasonable opportunity to   know, establish, and protect their rights under the law of the State?</p><p class="depth0">B. Is the State agency required to obtain, in time for prompt  determination of rights to benefits such information as will reasonably  insure the payment of benefits to individuals to whom benefits are due?</p><p class="depth0">C. Is the State agency required to keep records of the facts  considered in reaching determinations of rights to benefits?</p><p class="depth0">6013 Claim Determinations Requirements Designed To Meet Department  of Labor Criteria:</p><p class="depth0">A. Investigation of claims. The State agency is required to obtain  promptly and prior to a determination of an individual's right to  benefits, such facts pertaining thereto as will be sufficient reasonably  to insure the payment of benefits when due.</p><p class="depth0">This requirement embraces five separate elements:</p><p class="depth0">1. It is the responsibility of the agency to take the initiative in  the discovery of information. This responsibility may not be passed on  to the claimant or the employer. In addition to the agency's own  records, this information may be obtained from the worker, the employer,  or other sources. If the information obtained in the first instance  discloses no essential disagreement and provides a sufficient basis for  a fair determination, no further investigation is necessary. If the  information obtained from other sources differs essentially from that  furnished by the claimant, the agency, in order to meet its  responsibility, is required to inform the claimant of such information  from other sources and to afford the claimant an opportunity to furnish  any further facts he may have.</p><p class="depth0">2. Evidentiary facts must be obtained as distinguished from ultimate  facts or conclusions. That a worker was discharged for misconduct is an  ultimate fact or conclusion; that he destroyed a machine upon which he  was working is a primary or evidentiary fact, and the sort of fact that  the requirement refers to.</p><p class="depth0">3. The information obtained must be sufficient reasonably to insure  the payment of benefits when due. In general, the investigation made by  the agency must be complete enough to provide information upon which the  agency may act with reasonable assurance that its decision is consistent  with the unemployment compensation law. On the other hand, the  investigation should not be so exhaustive and time-consuming as unduly  to delay the payment of benefits and to result in excessive costs.</p><p class="depth0">4. Information must be obtained promptly so that the payment of  benefits is not unduly delayed.</p><p class="depth0">5. If the State agency requires any particular evidence from the  worker, it must give him a reasonable opportunity to obtain such  evidence.</p><p class="depth0">B. Recording of facts. The agency must keep a written record of the  facts considered in reaching its determinations.</p><p class="depth0">C. Determination notices:</p><p class="depth0">1. The agency must give each claimant a written notice of:</p><p class="depth0">a. Any monetary determination with respect to his benefit year;</p><p class="depth0">b. Any determination with respect to purging a disqualification if,  under the State law, a condition or qualification must be satisfied with  respect to each week of disqualification; but in lieu of giving written  notice of each determination for each week in which it is determined  that the claimant has met the requirements for purging, the agency may  inform the claimant that he has purged the disqualification for a week  by notation on his applicant identification card or otherwise in  writing.</p><p class="depth0">c. Any other determination which adversely affects his rights to  benefits, except that written notice of determination need not be given  with respect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. However, a written notice of determination is  required if: (a) there is a dispute concerning the reduction with  respect to any week (e.g., as to the amount computed as the appropriate  reduction, etc.); or (b) there is a change in the State law (or in the  application thereof) affecting the reduction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  and 2h. However, a written notice of determination is required if: (a)  there is a dispute concerning the denial or reduction of benefits with  respect to such week; or (b) there is a change in the State law (or in  the application thereof) affecting the denial or reduction; or (c) there  is a change in the amount of the reduction except as to the balance  covered by the last reduction in a series of reductions.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This procedure may be applied to determinations made with  respect to any subsequent weeks for the same reason and on the basis of  the same facts: (a) that claimant is unable to work, unavailable for  work, or is   disqualified under the labor dispute provision; and (b) reducing  claimant's weekly benefit amount because of income other than earnings  or offset by reason of overpayment.</p><p class="depth0">2. The agency must include in written notices of determinations  furnished to claimants sufficient information to enable them to  understand the determinations, the reasons therefor, and their rights to  protest, request reconsideration, or appeal.</p><p class="depth0">The written notice of monetary determination must contain the  information specified in the following items (except h) unless an item  is specifically not applicable. A written notice of any other  determination must contain the information specified in as many of the  following items as are necessary to enable the claimant to understand  the determination and to inform him of his appeal rights. Information  specifically applicable to the individual claimant must be contained in  the written notice of determination. Information of general application  such as (but not limited to) the explanation of benefits for partial  unemployment, information as to deductions, seasonality factors, and  information as to the manner and place of taking an appeal, extension of  the appeal period, and where to obtain information and assistance may be  contained in a booklet or leaflet which is given the claimant with his  monetary determination.</p><p class="depth0">a. Base period wages. The statement concerning base-period wages  must be in sufficient detail to show the basis of computation of  eligibility and weekly and maximum benefit amounts. (If maximum benefits  are allowed, it may not be necessary to show details of earnings.)</p><p class="depth0">b. Employer name. The name of the employer who reported the wage is  necessary so that the worker may check the wage transcript and know  whether it is correct. If the worker is given only the employer number,  he may not be able to check the accuracy of the wage transcript.</p><p class="depth0">c. Explanation of benefit formula--weekly and maximum benefit  amounts. Sufficient information must be given the worker so that he will  understand how his weekly benefit amount, including allowances for  dependents, and his maximum benefit amount were figured. If benefits are  computed by means of a table contained in the law, the table must be  furnished with the notice of determination whether benefits are granted  or denied.</p><p class="depth0">The written notice of determination must show clearly the weekly  benefit amount and the maximum potential benefits to which the claimant  is entitled.</p><p class="depth0">The notice to a claimant found ineligible by reason of insufficient  earnings in the base period must inform him clearly of the reason for  ineligibility. An explanation of the benefit formula contained in a  booklet or pamphlet should be given to each claimant at or prior to the  time he receives written notice of a monetary determination.</p><p class="depth0">d. Benefit year. An explanation of what is meant by the benefit year  and identification of the claimant's benefit year must be included in  the notice of determination.</p><p class="depth0">e. Information as to benefits for partial unemployment. There must  be included either in the written notice of determination or in a  booklet or pamphlet accompanying the notice an explanation of the  claimant's rights to partial benefits for any week with respect to which  he is working less than his normal customary full-time workweek because  of lack of work and for which he earns less than his weekly benefit  amount or weekly benefit amount plus earnings, whichever is provided by  the State law. If the explanation is contained in the notice of  determination, reference to the item in the notice in which his weekly  benefit amount is entered should be made.</p><p class="depth0">f. Deductions from weekly benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> above), where written notice of  determination is required (or given) it shall set forth the amount of  earnings, the method of computing the deduction in sufficient detail to  enable the claimant to verify the accuracy of the deduction, and his  right to protest, request redetermination, and appeal. Where a written  notice of determination is given to the claimant because there has been  a change in the State law or in the application of the law, an  explanation of the change shall be included.</p><p class="depth0">When claimant is not required to receive a written notice of  determination, he must be given a booklet or pamphlet the first time in  his benefit year that there is a deduction for earnings which shall  include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The method of computing deductions for earnings in sufficient  detail to enable the claimant to verify the accuracy of the deduction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That he will not automatically be given a written notice of  determination for a week with respect to which there is a deduction for  earnings (unless there is a dispute concerning the reduction with  respect to a week or there has been a change in the State law or in the  application of the law affecting the deduction) but that he may obtain  such a written notice upon request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A clear statement of his right to protest, request a  redetermination, and appeal from any determination deducting earnings  from his weekly benefit amount even though he does not automatically  receive a written notice of determination; and if the State law requires  written notice of determination in   order to effectuate a protest, redetermination, or appeal, he must be so  advised and advised also that he must request a written notice of  determination before he takes any such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other deductions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A written notice of determination is required with respect to  the first week in claimant's benefit year in which there is a reduction  from his benefits for a reason other than earnings. This notice must  describe the deduction made from claimant's weekly benefit amount, the  reason for the deduction, the method of computing it in sufficient  detail to enable him to verify the accuracy of such deduction, and his  right to protest, request redetermination, or appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A written notice of determination is not required for subsequent  weeks that a deduction is made for the same reason and on the basis of  the same facts, if the notice of determination pursuant to (2) (a), or a  booklet or pamphlet given him with such notice explains (i) the several  kinds of deductions which may be made under the State law (e.g.,  retirement pensions, vacation pay, and overpayments); (ii) the method of  computing each kind of deduction in sufficient detail that claimant will  be able to verify the accuracy of deductions made from his weekly  benefit payments; (iii) any limitation on the amount of any deduction or  the time in which any deduction may be made; (iv) that he will not  automatically be given a written notice of determination for subsequent  weeks with respect to which there is a deduction for the same reason and  on the basis of the same facts, but that he may obtain a written notice  of determination upon request; (v) his right to protest, request  redetermination, or appeal with respect to subsequent weeks for which  there is a reduction from his benefits for the same reason, and on the  basis of the same facts even though he does not automatically receive a  written notice of determination; and (vi) that if the State law requires  written notice of determination in order to effectuate a protest,  redetermination, or appeal, he must be so advised and advised also that  he must request a written notice of determination before he takes any  such action.</p><p class="depth0">g. Seasonality factors. If the individual's determination is  affected by seasonality factors under the State law, an adequate  explanation must be made. General explanations of seasonality factors  which may affect determinations for subsequent weeks may be included in  a booklet or pamphlet given claimant with his notice of monetary  determinations.</p><p class="depth0">h. Disqualification or ineligibility. If a disqualification is  imposed, or if the claimant is declared ineligible for one or more  weeks, he must be given not only a statement of the period of  disqualification or ineligibility and the amount of wage-credit  reductions, if any, but also an explanation of the reason for the  ineligibility or disqualification. This explanation must be sufficiently  detailed so that he will understand why he is ineligible or why he has  been disqualified, and what he must do in order to requalify for  benefits or purge the disqualification. The statement must be  individualized to indicate the facts upon which the determination was  based, e.g., state, ``It is found that you left your work with Blank  Company because you were tired of working; the separation was voluntary,  and the reason does not constitute good cause,'' rather than merely the  phrase ``voluntary quit.'' Checking a box as to the reason for the  disqualification is not a sufficiently detailed explanation. However,  this statement of the reason for the disqualification need not be a  restatement of all facts considered in arriving at the determination.</p><p class="depth0">i. Appeal rights. The claimant must be given information with  respect to his appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following information shall be included in the notice of  determination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A statement that he may appeal or, if the State law requires or  permits a protest or redetermination before an appeal, that he may  protest or request a redetermination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The period within which an appeal, protest, or request for  redetermination must be filed. The number of days provided by statute  must be shown as well as either the beginning date or ending date of the  period. (It is recommended that the ending date of the appeal period be  shown, as this is the more understandable of the alternatives.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following information must be included either in the notice  of determination or in separate informational material referred to in  the notice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The manner in which the appeal, protest, or request for  redetermination must be filed, e.g., by signed letter, written  statement, or on a prescribed form, and the place or places to which the  appeal, protest, or request for redetermination may be mailed or hand- delivered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An explanation of any circumstances (such as nonworkdays, good  cause, etc.) which will extend the period for the appeal, protest, or  request for redetermination beyond the date stated or identified in the  notice of determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That any further information claimant may need or desire can be  obtained together with assistance in filing his appeal, protest, or  request for redetermination from the local office.</p><p class="depth0">If the information is given in separate material, the notice of  determination would adequately refer to such material if it said, for  example, ``For other information about your (appeal), (protest),  (redetermination) rights, see pages ---- to ---- of the ---- (name of  pamphlet or booklet) heretofore furnished to you.''</p><p class="depth0">6014 Separation Information Requirements Designed To Meet Department  of Labor Criteria:</p><p class="depth0">A. Information to agency. Where workers are separated, employers are  required to furnish the agency promptly, either upon agency request or  upon such separation, a notice describing the reasons for and the  circumstances of the separation and any additional information which  might affect a claimant's right to benefits. Where workers are working  less than full time, employers are required to furnish the agency  promptly, upon agency request, information concerning a claimant's hours  of work and his wages during the claim periods involved, and other facts  which might affect a claimant's eligibility for benefits during such  periods.</p><p class="depth0">When workers are separated and the notices are obtained on a request  basis, or when workers are working less than full time and the agency  requests information, it is essential to the prompt processing of claims  that the request be sent out promptly after the claim is filed and the  employer be given a specific period within which to return the notice,  preferably within 2 working days.</p><p class="depth0">When workers are separated and notices are obtained upon separation,  it is essential that the employer be required to send the notice to the  agency with sufficient promptness to insure that, if a claim is filed,  it may be processed promptly. Normally, it is desirable that such a  notice be sent to the central office of the agency, since the employer  may not know in which local office the worker will file his claim. The  usual procedure is for the employer to give the worker a copy of the  notice sent by the employer to the agency.</p><p class="depth0">B. Information to worker:</p><p class="depth0">1. Information required to be given. Employers are required to give  their employees information and instructions concerning the employees'  potential rights to benefits and concerning registration for work and  filing claims for benefits.</p><p class="depth0">The information furnished to employees under such a requirement need  not be elaborate; it need only be adequate to insure that the worker who  is separated or who is working less than full time knows he is  potentially eligible for benefits and is informed as to what he is to do  or where he is to go to file his claim and register for work. When he  files his claim, he can obtain more detailed information.</p><p class="depth0">In States that do not require employers to furnish periodically to  the State agency detailed reports of the wages paid to their employees,  each employer is required to furnish to his employees information as to  (a) the name under which he is registered by the State agency, (b) the  address where he maintains his payroll records, and (c) the workers'  need for this information if and when they file claims for benefits.</p><p class="depth0">2. Methods for giving information. The information and instructions  required above may be given in any of the following ways:</p><p class="depth0">a. Posters prominently displayed in the employer's establishment.  The State agency should supply employers with a sufficient number of  posters for distribution throughout their places of business and should  see that the posters are conspicuously displayed at all times.</p><p class="depth0">b. Leaflets. Leaflets distributed either periodically or at the time  of separation or reduction of hours. The State agency should supply  employers with a sufficient number of leaflets.</p><p class="depth0">c. Individual notices. Individual notices given to each employee at  the time of separation or reduction in hours.</p><p class="depth0">It is recommended that the State agency's publicity program be used  to supplement the employer-information requirements. Such a program  should stress the availability and location of claim-filing offices and  the importance of visiting those offices whenever the worker is  unemployed, wishes to apply for benefits, and to seek a job.</p><p class="depth0">6015 Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions with Respect to  Claim Determinations and Separation Information. If the State law  provisions do not conform to the suggested requirements set forth in  sections 6013 and 6014, but the State law contains alternative  provisions, the Bureau of Employment Security, in collaboration with the  State agency, will study the actual or anticipated effects of the  alternative provisions. If the Administrator of the Bureau concludes  that the alternative provisions satisfy the criteria in section 6012, he  will so notify the State agency. If the Administrator of the Bureau does  not so conclude, he will submit the matter to the Secretary. If the  Secretary concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy the criteria  in section 6012, the State agency will be so notified. If the Secretary  concludes that there is a question as to whether the alternative  provisions satisfy the criteria, the State agency will be advised that  unless the State law provisions are appropriately revised, a notice of  hearing will be issued as required by the Code of Federal Regulations,  title 20, Sec. 601.5.

Section 303(a)(1) of the Social  Security Act requires that a State law include provision for:</p><p class="depth0">``Such methods of administration . . . as are found by the Secretary  to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment  compensation when due.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1603(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and section  3030(a)(5) of the Social Security Act require that a State law include  provision for:</p><p class="depth0">``Expenditure of all money withdrawn from an unemployment fund of  such State, in the payment of unemployment compensation . . .''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1607(h) of the Internal Revenue Code defines  ``compensation'' as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect  to their unemployment.''</p><p class="depth0">7511 The Secretary's Interpretation of Federal Law Requirements. The  Secretary of Labor interprets the above sections to require that a State  law include provision for such methods of administration as are, within  reason, calculated (1) to detect benefits paid through error by the  agency or through willful misrepresentation or error by the claimant or  others, and (2) to deter claimants from obtaining benefits through  willful misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth0">7513 Criteria for Review of State Conformity With Federal  Requirements. In determining State conformity with the above  requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act,  as interpreted by the Secretary of Labor, the following criteria will be  applied:</p><p class="depth0">A. Are investigations required to be made after the payment of  benefits, (or, in the case of interstate claims, are investigations made  by the agent State after the processing of claims) as to claimants'  entitlement to benefits paid to them in a sufficient proportion of cases  to test the effectiveness of the agency's procedures for the prevention  of payments which are not due? To carry out investigations, has the  agency assigned to some individual or unit, as a basic function, the  responsibility of making or functionally directing such investigations?</p><p class="depth0">Explanation: It is not feasible to prescribe the extent to which the  above activities are required; however, they should always be carried on  to such an extent that they will show whether or not error or willful  misrepresentation is increasing or decreasing, and will reveal problem  areas. The extent and nature of the above activities should be varied  according to the seriousness of the problem in the State. The  responsible individual or unit should:</p><p class="depth0">1. Check paid claims for overpayment and investigate for willful  misrepresentation or, alternatively, advise and assist the operating  units in the performance of such functions, or both;</p><p class="depth0">2. Perform consultative services with respect to methods and  procedures for the prevention and detection of fraud; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Perform other services which are closely related to the above.</p><p class="depth0">Although a State agency is expected to make a full-time assignment  of responsibility to a unit or individual to carry on the functions  described above, a small State agency might make these functions a part- time responsibility of one individual. In connection with the detection  of overpayments, such a unit or individual might, for example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Investigate information on suspected benefit fraud received from  any agency personnel, and from sources outside the agency, including  anonymous complaints;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Investigate information secured from comparisons of benefit  payments with employment records to detect cases of concurrent working  (whether in covered or noncovered work) and claiming of benefits  (including benefit payments in which the agency acted as agent for  another State).</p><p class="depth0">The benefit fraud referred to herein may involve employers, agency  employees, and witnesses, as well as claimants.</p><p class="depth0">Comparisons of benefit payments with employment records are comonly  made either by post-audit or by industry surveys. The so-called ``post- audit'' is a matching of central office wage-record files against  benefit payments for the same period. ``Industry surveys'' or ``mass  audits'' are done in some States by going directly to employers for pay- roll information to be checked against concurrent benefit lists. A plan  of investigation based on a sample post-audit will be considered as  partial fulfillment of the investigation program; it would need to be  supplemented by other methods capable of detecting overpayments to  persons who have moved into noncovered occupations or are claiming  interstate benefits.</p><p class="depth0">B. Are adequate records maintained by which the results of  investigations may be evaluated?</p><p class="depth0">Explanation. To meet this criterion, the State agency will be  expected to maintain records of all its activities in the detection of  overpayments, showing whether attributable to error or willful  misrepresentation, measuring the results obtained through various  methods, and noting the remedial action taken in each case. The adequacy  and effectiveness of various methods of checking for willful  misrepresentation can be evaluated only if records are kept of the  results obtained. Internal reports on fraudulent and erroneous  overpayments are needed by State agencies for self-evaluation. Detailed  records should be maintained in order that the State agency may  determine, for example, which of several methods of checking currently  used are the most productive. Such records also will provide the basis  for drawing a clear distinction between fraud and error.</p><p class="depth0">C. Does the agency take adequate action with respect to publicity  concerning willful misrepresentation and its legal consequences to deter  fraud by claimants?</p><p class="depth0">Explanation. To meet this criterion, the State agency must issue  adequate material of claimant eligibility requirements and must take  necessary action to obtain publicity on the legal consequences of  willful   misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure of facts.</p><p class="depth0">Public announcements on convictions and resulting penalties for  fraud are generally considered necessary as a deterrent to other  persons, and to inform the public that the agency is carrying on an  effective program to prevent fraud. This alone is not considered  adequate publicity. It is important that information be circulated which  will explain clearly and understandably the claimant's rights, and the  obligations which he must fulfill to be eligible for benefits. Leaflets  for distribution and posters placed in local offices are appropriate  media for such information.</p><p class="depth0">*7515 Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions with Respect to  Erroneous and Illegal Payments. If the methods of administration  provided for by the State law do not conform to the suggested methods of  meeting the requirements set forth in section 7511, but a State law does  provide for alternative methods of administration designed to accomplish  the same results, the Bureau of Employment Security, in collaboration  with the State agency, will study the actual or anticipated effect of  the alternative methods of administration. If the Bureau concludes that  the alternative methods satisfy the criteria in section 7513, it will so  notify the State agency. If the Bureau does not so conclude, it will  submit to the Secretary the results of the study for his determination  of whether the State's alternative methods of administration meet the  criteria.
