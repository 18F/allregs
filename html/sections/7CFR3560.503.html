It is the Agency's priority that property  previously operated as program property prior to becoming REO inventory  property be sold as program property. However, REO property may be sold  under whatever Agency program is most appropriate for the property and  the community needs regardless of the program under which the property  was originally financed or whether the property was being used to secure  loans under more than one Agency program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Agency determines that the REO property to be sold is  not decent, safe, and sanitary and/or does not meet cost effective  energy conservation standards, it will disclose the basis for this  determination to prospective purchasers. The deed by which such an REO  property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from  residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary, and meets the  Agency's cost effective conservation standards. The Agency will also  notify any potential purchaser of any known lead based paint hazards.</p>
