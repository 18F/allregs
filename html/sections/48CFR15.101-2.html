Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in

15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business' past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tradeoffs are not permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exchanges may occur (see 15.306).
