                            <p class="depth0">This part implements legislation concerning the measurement of vessels to determine their tonnage (part J of 46 U.S.C. subtitle II). Tonnages are required before a vessel may be documented as a vessel of the United States. Also, tonnages are used to apply commercial vessel safety regulations based on tonnage, to meet the requirements of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, and to determine Federal and State regulatory fees and private operational charges based on tonnage. Tonnages are determined by the physical measurement of a vessel (Convention, Standard, and Dual Measurement Systems) or by application of a formula based on the vessel's dimensions provided by the owner (Simplified Measurement System). This part indicates the particular measurement system or systems under which the vessel is required or eligible to be measured, describes the application and measurement procedures for each system, identifies the organizations authorized to measure vessels under this part, and provides for the appeal of measurement organizations' decisions.</p>
