                            <p class="depth0">The business financed with a B&I; loan must be located in a rural area. Loans to borrowers with facilities located in both rural and non-rural areas will be limited to the amount necessary to finance the facility located in the eligible rural area. Cooperatives that are headquartered in a non-rural area may be eligible for a B&I; loan if the loan is used for a project or venture that is located in a rural area. Rural areas are any areas other than a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants; and the urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to such a city or town, as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. For the purpose of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census). If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An urbanized area means a densely populated territory as defined in the most recent decennial Census or other Agency-accepted data source if not defined in the most recent decennial Census.
