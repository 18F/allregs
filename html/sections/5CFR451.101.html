                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chapter 45 of title 5, United States Code authorizes agencies to  pay a cash award to, grant time-off to, and incur necessary expense for  the honorary recognition of, an employee (individually or as a member of  a group) and requires the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe  regulations governing such authority. Chapter 43 of title 5, United  States Code, provides for recognizing and rewarding employees whose  performance so warrants. The regulations in this subpart, in combination  with chapters 43 and 45 of title 5, United States Code, and any other  applicable law, establish the requirements for agency award programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 4 of E.O. 11438 (Prescribing Procedures Governing  Interdepartmental Cash Awards to the Members of the Armed Forces,  December 3, 1968) requires the Office of Personnel Management to  prescribe procedures for covering the cost of a cash award recommended  by more than one agency for a member of the armed forces for the  adoption or use of a suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement.  Section 1 of E.O. 12828 (Delegation of Certain Personnel Management  Authorities, January 5, 1993) delegates to the Office of Personnel  Management the authority of the President to permit performance-based  cash awards under 5 U.S.C. 4505a to be paid to categories of employees  who would not be eligible otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart applies to employees as defined by section 2105 and  agencies as defined by section 4501 of title 5, United States Code,  except as provided in Sec. Sec. 451.105 and 451.201(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the regulatory requirements for granting performance awards  to Senior Executive Service (SES) employees under 5 U.S.C. 5384, refer  to Sec. 534.405 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An agency may grant performance-based cash awards on the basis  of a rating of record at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or  above under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4505a and the provisions of this  part to eligible non-GS employees who are covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 45  and this part and who are not otherwise covered by an explicit statutory  authority for the payment of such awards, including 5 U.S.C. 5384 (SES  performance awards).
