                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. A foreign bank that has an insured branch must pledge assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee(s). Whenever the FDIC is obligated under section 11(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(f)) to pay the insured deposits of an insured branch, the assets pledged under this section must become the property of the FDIC and be used to the extent necessary to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amount of assets to be pledged. (1) For a newly insured branch, a foreign bank must pledge assets equal to at least 5 percent of the liabilities of the branch, based on the branch's projection of its liabilities at the end of each of the first three years of operations. For all other insured branches, a foreign bank must pledge assets equal to the appropriate percentage applicable

to the insured branch, as determined by reference to the risk-based assessment schedule contained in this paragraph, of the insured branch's average liabilities for the last 30 days of the most recent calendar quarter. \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ This average must be computed by using the sum of the close of business figures for the 30 calendar days of the most recent calendar quarter, ending with and including the last day of the calendar quarter, divided by 30. For days on which the branch is closed, however, balances from the previous business day are to be used in determining its average liabilities. In determining its average liabilities, the insured branch may exclude liabilities to other offices, agencies, branches, and wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank. The value of the pledged assets must be computed based on the lesser of the principal amount (par value) or market value of such assets at the time of the original pledge and thereafter as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk-based assessment schedule. The risk-based asset pledge required by paragraph (b)(1) will be determined by utilizing the following risk-based assessment schedule:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Supervisory risk subgroup</p><p class="depth0">Asset maintenance level      --------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A (%)        B (%)        C (%)------------------------------------------------------------------------Equal to or greater than 108%....            2            3            4Equal to or greater than 106%....            4            5            6Less than 106%...................            6            7            8------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate asset pledge percentage will be determined based on the supervisory risk subgroup and asset maintenance level applicable to the insured branch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Supervisory risk factors. For purposes of this section, within each asset maintenance group, each institution will be assigned to one of three subgroups based on consideration by the FDIC of supervisory evaluations provided by the primary federal regulator for the insured branch. The supervisory evaluations include the results of examination findings by the primary federal regulator, as well as other information the primary federal regulator determines to be relevant. In addition, the FDIC will take into consideration such other information (such as state examination findings, if appropriate) as it determines to be relevant to the financial condition and the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The three supervisory subgroups are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subgroup ``A''. This subgroup consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subgroup ``B''. This subgroup consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which, if not corrected, could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the deposit insurance fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subgroup ``C''. This subgroup consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the deposit insurance fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The FDIC may require a foreign bank to pledge additional assets or to compute its pledge on a daily basis whenever the FDIC determines that the condition of the foreign bank or the insured branch is such that the assets pledged under this section will not adequately protect the deposit insurance fund. In requiring a foreign bank to pledge additional assets, the FDIC will consult with the primary regulator for the insured branch. Among the factors to be considered in imposing these requirements are the concentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers, the concentration of transfer risk related to any one country, including the country in which the foreign bank's head office is located or any other factor the FDIC determines is relevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each insured branch must separately comply with the requirements of this section. A foreign bank which has more than one insured branch in a state may, however, treat all of its insured branches in the same state as one entity and will designate one insured branch to be responsible for compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Depository. A foreign bank must place pledged assets for safekeeping at any depository which is located in any state. However, a depository may not be an affiliate of the foreign bank whose insured branch is seeking to use the depository. A foreign bank must obtain the FDIC's prior written approval of the depository selected, and such approval may be revoked and dismissal of the depository required whenever the depository does not fulfill any one of its obligations under the pledge agreement. A foreign bank shall appoint and constitute the depository as its attorney in fact for the sole purpose of transferring title to pledged assets to the FDIC as may be required to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assets that may be pledged. Subject to the right of the FDIC to require substitution, a foreign bank may pledge any of the kinds of assets listed in this paragraph (d); such assets must be denominated in United States dollars. A foreign bank shall be deemed to have pledged any such assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee at such time as any such asset is placed with the depository, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Negotiable certificates of deposit that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any state bank, national bank, state or federal savings association, or branch of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement or similar debt instruments that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any agency of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement; provided, that the maturity of any certificate or issuance is not greater than one year; and provided further, that the issuing branch or agency of a foreign bank is not an affiliate of the pledging bank or from the same country as the pledging bank's domicile;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Negotiable certificates of deposit that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any state bank, national bank, state or federal savings association, or branch of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement or similar debt instruments that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any agency of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement; provided, that the maturity of any certificate or issuance is not greater than one year; and provided further, that the issuing branch or agency of a foreign bank is not an affiliate of the pledging bank or from the same country as the pledging bank's domicile;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-negotiable certificates of deposit, subject to the terms specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section other than the requirement of negotiability, that were pledged as collateral to the FDIC on March 18, 2005, until maturity according to the original terms of the existing deposit agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treasury bills, interest bearing bonds, notes, debentures, or other direct obligations of or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commercial paper that is rated P-1 or P-2, or their equivalent by a nationally recognized rating service; provided, that any conflict in a rating shall be resolved in favor of the lower rating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Banker's acceptances that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any state bank, national bank, state or federal savings association, or branch or agency of a foreign bank; provided, that the maturity of any acceptance is not greater than 180 days; and provided further, that the branch or agency issuing the acceptance is not an affiliate of the pledging bank or from the same country as the pledging bank's domicile;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> General obligations of any state of the United States, or any county or municipality of any state of the United States, or any agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the foregoing or any obligation guaranteed by a state of the United States or any county or municipality of any state of the United States; provided, that such obligations have a credit rating within the top two rating bands of a nationally recognized rating service (with any conflict in a rating resolved in favor of the lower rating);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Obligations of the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Notes issued by bank and thrift holding companies, banks, or savings associations organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or notes issued by United States branches or agencies of foreign banks, provided, that the notes have a credit rating within the top two rating bands of a nationally recognized rating service (with any conflict in a rating resolved in favor of the lower rating) and that they are payable in the United States, and provided further, that the issuer is not an affiliate of the foreign bank pledging the note; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Any other asset determined by the FDIC to be acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Pledge agreement. A foreign bank shall not pledge any assets unless a pledge agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the FDIC has been executed by the foreign bank and the depository. The agreement, in addition to other terms not inconsistent with this paragraph (e), shall give effect to the following terms:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Original pledge. The foreign bank shall place with the depository assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section, having an aggregate value in the amount as required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional assets required to be pledged. Whenever the foreign bank is required to pledge additional assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designees pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, it shall deliver (within two business days after the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, unless otherwise ordered) additional assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section, having an aggregate value in the amount required by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Substitution of assets. The foreign bank, at any time, may substitute any assets for pledged assets, and, upon such substitution, the depository shall promptly release any such assets to the foreign bank; provided, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The foreign bank pledges assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section having an aggregate value not less than the value of the pledged assets for which they are substituted and certified as such by the foreign bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The FDIC has not by written notification to the foreign bank, a copy of which shall be provided to the depository, suspended or terminated the foreign bank's right of substitution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Delivery of other documents. Concurrently with the pledge of any assets, the foreign bank will deliver to the depository all documents and instruments necessary or advisable to effectuate the transfer of title to any such assets and thereafter, from time to time, at the request of the FDIC, deliver to the depository any such additional documents or instruments. The foreign bank shall provide copies of all such documents described in this paragraph (e)(4) to the appropriate regional director concurrently with their delivery to the depository.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Acceptance and safekeeping responsibilities of the depository. (i) The depository will accept and hold any assets pledged by the foreign bank pursuant to the pledge agreement for safekeeping free and clear of any lien, charge, right of offset, credit, or preference in connection with any claim the depository may assert against the foreign bank and shall designate any such assets as a special pledge for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee. The depository shall not accept the pledge of any such assets unless, concurrently with such pledge, the foreign bank delivers to the depository the documents and instruments necessary for the transfer of title thereto as provided in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The depository will accept and hold any assets pledged by the foreign bank pursuant to the pledge agreement for safekeeping free and clear of any lien, charge, right of offset, credit, or preference in connection with any claim the depository may assert against the foreign bank and shall designate any such assets as a special pledge for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee. The depository shall not accept the pledge of any such assets unless, concurrently with such pledge, the foreign bank delivers to the depository the documents and instruments necessary for the transfer of title thereto as provided in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The depository shall hold any such assets separate from all other assets of the foreign bank or the depository. Such assets may be held in book-entry form but must at all times be segregated on the records of the depository and clearly identified as assets subject to the pledge agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reporting requirements of the insured branch and the depository--(i) Initial reports. Upon the original pledge of assets as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial reports. Upon the original pledge of assets as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The depository shall provide to the foreign bank and to the appropriate FDIC regional director a written report in the form of a receipt identifying each asset pledged and specifying in reasonable detail with respect to each such asset the complete title, interest rate, series, serial number (if any), principal amount (par value), maturity date and call date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The foreign bank shall provide to the appropriate regional director a written report certified as correct by the foreign bank which sets forth the value of each pledged asset and the aggregate value of all such assets, and which states that the aggregate value of all such assets is at least equal to the amount required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and that all such assets are of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Quarterly reports.

The depository shall release to the foreign bank any pledged assets, as specified in a written notification of the appropriate regional director, upon the terms and conditions provided in such notification, including without limitation the waiver of any requirement that any assets be pledged by the foreign bank in substitution of any released assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Release to the FDIC.

Upon release and transfer of title to all pledged assets specified in the certification, the depository shall be discharged from any further obligation under the pledge agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Interest earned on assets. The foreign bank may retain any interest earned with respect to the assets currently pledged unless the FDIC by written notice prohibits retention of interest by the foreign bank, in which case the notice shall specify the disposition of any such interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Expenses of agreement.
