                                Sec.  73.153  Field strength measurements in support of applications
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In the determination of interference, groundwave field strength  measurements will take precedence over theoretical values, provided such  measurements are properly taken and presented. When measurements of   groundwave signal strength are presented, they shall be sufficiently  complete in accordance with Sec.  73.186 to determine the field strength  at 1 mile in the pertinent directions for that station. The antenna  resistance measurements required by Sec.  73.186 need not be taken or  submitted.  [44 FR 36037, June 20, 1979, as amended at 56 FR 64862, Dec. 12, 1991]</p>
