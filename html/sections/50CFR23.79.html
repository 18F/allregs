A  participating institution may be a botanical garden, arboretum,  zoological park, research institution, or other qualifying institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Willing to transfer confiscated plants from the port where they  were confiscated to their facilities at their own expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Willing to return the plants to the U.S. Government if the  country of export has requested their return. The U.S. Government will  then coordinate the plants' return to the country of export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Willing to accept and maintain a plant shipment as a unit until  it has received authorization from us to incorporate the shipment into  its permanent collection or transfer a portion of it to another  participating institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Participation.

They must provide a brief description of the greenhouse or  display facilities, the names and telephone numbers of any individuals  authorized to accept plants on behalf of the institution, and the  mailing address where the plants should be sent.
