                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pool characteristics. As set forth in the Program Guide, each Pool must have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A minimum number of guaranteed portions of loans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A minimum aggregate principal balance of the guaranteed portions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A maximum percentage of the Pool which an individual guaranteed portion may constitute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A maximum allowable difference between the highest and lowest note interest rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A maximum allowable difference between the remaining terms to maturity of the loans in the Pool;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A minimum weighted average maturity at Pool formation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A maximum allowable difference between the highest and lowest Net Rate on the guaranteed portions that are placed in a WAC Pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment of Pool characteristics. SBA may adjust the Pool characteristics periodically based upon program experience and market conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Increments of guaranteed portion. If the amount of the guaranteed portion of an individual 7(a) guaranteed loan is more than $500,000, a Pool Assembler may elect to divide the guaranteed portion into increments of $500,000 and one increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any guaranteed portion in a Pool to be not more than $500,000. Only one increment from a loan to a specific borrower may be included in a Pool.
