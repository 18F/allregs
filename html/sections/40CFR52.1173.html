This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR  51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an  attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control  measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and  other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as  this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to Clean Air Act section 179(c), EPA has determined  that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area attained the annual 1997  PM2.5 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, April 5, 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Approval--The 1997 annual PM2.5 maintenance plans for  the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe,  Oakland, St. Clair,   Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties), has been approved as submitted on July  5, 2011.
