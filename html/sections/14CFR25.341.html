The dynamic response of the airplane to vertical and lateral continuous turbulence must be taken into account. The dynamic analysis must take into account unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and all significant structural degrees of freedom including rigid body motions.

The value of limit load is that load with the same probability of exceedance in the turbulence field as AU[sigma] of the same load quantity in a linear approximated model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Supplementary gust conditions for wing-mounted engines. For airplanes equipped with wing-mounted engines, the engine mounts, pylons, and wing supporting structure must be designed for the maximum response at the nacelle center of gravity derived from the following dynamic gust conditions applied to the airplane:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A discrete gust determined in accordance with Sec. 25.341(a) at each angle normal to the flight path, and separately,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A pair of discrete gusts, one vertical and one lateral. The length of each of these gusts must be independently tuned to the maximum response in accordance with Sec. 25.341(a). The penetration of the airplane in the combined gust field and the phasing of the vertical and lateral component gusts must be established to develop the maximum response to the gust pair. In the absence of a more rational analysis, the following formula must be used for each of the maximum engine loads in all six degrees of freedom:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11DE14.027
