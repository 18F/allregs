                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The two-parent participation rate for a fiscal year is the average of the State's two-parent participation rates for each month in the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The two-parent participation rate for a fiscal year is the average of the State's two-parent participation rates for each month in the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate applies to two-parent families with two work-eligible individuals. However, if one of the parents is a work-eligible individual with a disability, we will not consider the family to be a two-parent family; i.e., we will not include such a family in either the numerator or denominator of the two-parent rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We determine a State's two-parent participation rate for the month as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of two-parent TANF and SSP-MOE families in which both parents are work-eligible individuals and together they meet the requirements set forth in Sec. 261.32 for the month (i.e., the numerator), divided by,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of two-parent TANF and SSP-MOE families in which both parents are work-eligible individuals during the month, minus the number of such two-parent families that are subject to a penalty for refusing to work in that month (the denominator). However, if a family with a work-eligible individual has been penalized for more than three months of the last 12 months, we will not exclude it from the participation rate calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At State option, we will include in the participation rate calculation families with a work-eligible individual that have been penalized for refusing to

work no more than three of the last 12 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section, a two-parent family includes, at a minimum, all families with two natural or adoptive parents (of the same minor child) who are work-eligible individuals and living in the home, unless both are minors and neither is a head-of-household.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> If the family receives assistance for only part of a month, we will count it as a month of participation if a work-eligible individual in the family (or both work-eligible individuals, if they are both required to work) is engaged in work for the minimum average number of hours in each full week that the family receives assistance in that month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the family receives assistance for only part of a month, we will count it as a month of participation if a work-eligible individual in the family (or both work-eligible individuals, if they are both required to work) is engaged in work for the minimum average number of hours in each full week that the family receives assistance in that month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a State pays benefits retroactively (i.e., for the period between application and approval of benefits), it has the option to consider the family to be receiving assistance during the period of retroactivity.</p>
