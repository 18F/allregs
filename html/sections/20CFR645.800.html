Any exception not specifically  urged shall be deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for  review must be sent to the opposing party at that time. Thereafter, the  decision of the ALJ shall constitute final agency action unless the ARB,  within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, has notified  the parties that the case has been accepted for review. Any case  accepted by the ARB shall be decided   within 120 days of such acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of  the ALJ shall constitute final agency action.</p>
