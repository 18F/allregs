                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer, the manufacturer's DAPIA acting on behalf of HUD, and the manufacturer's IPIA acting on behalf of HUD may agree to permit certain aspects of construction of a manufactured home to be completed to the Construction and Safety Standards on-site in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. The aspects of construction that may be approved to be completed on-site are the partial completion of structural assemblies or systems (e.g., electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, fuel burning, and fire safety systems) and components built as an integral part of the home, when the partial completion on-site is warranted because completion of the partial structural assembly or system during the manufacturing process in the factory would not be practicable (e.g., because of the home design or which could result in transportation damage or if precluded because of road restrictions). Examples of construction that may be completed on-site include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hinged roof and eave construction, unless exempted as installation by Sec. 3285.801(f) of the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards and completed and inspected in accordance with the Manufactured Home Installation Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any work required by the home design that cannot be completed in the factory, or when the manufacturer authorizes the retailer to provide an add-on, not including an attached garage, to the home during installation, when that work would take the home out of conformance with the construction and safety standards and then bring it back into conformance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appliances provided by the manufacturer, installer, retailer, or purchaser, including fireplaces to be installed on site;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Components or parts that are shipped loose with the manufactured home and that will be installed on-site, unless exempted as installation by the installation standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exterior applications such as brick siding, stucco, or tile roof systems; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other construction such as roof extensions (dormers), site-installed windows in roofs, removable or open floor sections for basement stairs, and sidewall bay windows.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer or a licensed contractor or similarly qualified professional with prior authorization from the manufacturer may perform the on-site work in accordance with the DAPIA approvals and site completion instructions. However, the manufacturer is responsible for the adequacy of all on-site completion work regardless of who does the work, and must prepare and provide all site inspection reports, as well as the certification of completion, and must fulfill all of its responsibilities and maintain all records at the factory of origin as required by Sec. 3282.609.</p>
