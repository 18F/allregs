                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under Sec. 75.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Summary schedule of prior audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the FAC;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A management decision was not issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrective action plan. At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in Sec. 75.516, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.</p>
