The Commission will consider the views of the Department of Defense  (DOD) and or the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the importance of  the activities responsible for generating the LLW to the common defense  and security, when evaluating requests based all, or in part, on a  serious and immediate threat to the common defense and security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In making the determination required by Sec. 62.21(a)(2) of  this part, the Commission will consider whether the person submitting  the request--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has identified and evaluated any alternative that could mitigate  the need for emergency access; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has considered all pertinent factors in its evaluation of  alternatives including state-of-the-art technology and impacts on public  health and safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In making the determination required by Sec. 62.21(a)(2) of  this part, the Commission will consider implementation of an alternative  to be unreasonable if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It adversely affects public health and safety, the environment,  or the common defense and security; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It results in a significant curtailment or cessation of  essential services, affecting public health and safety or the common  defense and security; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is beyond the technical and economic capabilities of the  person requesting emergency access; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Implementation of the alternative would conflict with applicable  State or local or Federal laws and regulations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It cannot be implemented in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commission shall make an affirmative determination under  Sec. 62.21(a) of this part only if all of the alternatives that were  considered are found to be unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> As part of its mandated evaluation of the alternatives that were  considered by the generator, the Commission shall consider the  characteristics of the wastes (including: physical properties, chemical  properties, radioactivity, pathogenicity, infectiousness, and toxicity,  pyrophoricity, and explosive potential); condition of current container;  potential for contaminating the disposal site; the technologies or  combination of technologies available for treatment of the waste  (including incinerators; evaporators-crystallizers; fluidized bed  dryers; thin film evaporators; extruders, evaporators; and Compactors);  the suitability of volume reduction equipment to the circumstances  (specific activity considerations, actual volume reduction factors,  generation of secondary wastes, equipment contamination, effluent  releases, worker exposure, and equipment availability); and the  administrative controls which could be applied, in making a  determination whether waste to be delivered for disposal under this part  has been reduced in volume to the maximum extent practicable using  available technology.</p>
