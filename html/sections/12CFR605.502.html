                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Farm Credit Administration has no authority for the original  classification of information for national security purposes. Only those  agencies described in the Executive order may so classify information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Derivative classification. ``Derivative classification'' means  the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or generating in new form  information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed  material consistent with the classification markings that apply to the  source information. Derivative classification includes the  classification of information based on classification guidance. The  duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not  derivative classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mandatory declassification review. ``Mandatory declassification  review'' means the review for declassification of classified information  in response to a request for declassification that meets the  requirements under section 3.5 of the Executive order. All requests for  review for declassification under the mandatory review provisions of the  Executive order shall be handled by the Information Security Officer or  his/her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Handling of classified documents. All documents bearing the  terms ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' shall be  delivered to the Information Security Officer or his/her designee  immediately upon receipt. All potential recipients of such documents  shall be advised of the names of such designees. In the event that the  Information Security Officer or his/her designee is not available to  receive such documents, they shall be sent to the FCA mailroom and  stored in the combination safe and secured unopened until the  Information Security Officer is available. Under no cirumstances shall  classified materials that cannot be delivered be stored other than in  the designated safe. All materials not immediately deliverable or able  to be secured in the designated safe shall be returned to the sender,  under appropriate cover, for redelivery to the FCA at the next earliest  opportunity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reproduction. Reproduction of classified materials shall take  place only in accordance with section 4.2(g) of the Executive order and  any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies be made, they  shall be subject to the same controls as the original document. Records  showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained by the  Information Security Officer or his/her designee, and the log stored  with the original documents. These measures shall not restrict  reproduction for the purposes of Mandatory Review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Storage. In accordance with 32 CFR 2001.43, all classified  documents shall be stored in combination safes located at the primary  headquarters and/or a Field Office, Office of Examination, Farm Credit  Administration. The combinations shall be changed as required by  directives issued by ISOO. The combinations shall be known only to the  Information Security Officer and his/her designees who have appropriate  security clearances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Employee education. All employees who have been granted a  security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials  shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and  shall be required to review the Executive order and appropriate ISOO  directives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Agency terminology. No official of the Farm Credit  Administration shall use the terms ``Top Secret'', ``Secret'', or  ``Confidential'' except in relation to materials classified for national  security purposes. As a Federal regulatory agency, the Farm Credit  Administration maintains certain internal documents that relate to its  examination and supervision of the institutions of the Farm Credit  System. Such documents are limited in use and distribution. Material  that is of a sensitive nature to the Farm Credit Administration may be  designated ``Executive Document.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Nondisclosure agreement. In accordance with 32 CFR 2003.20, the  Farm Credit Administration requires that any person whose position  requires access to classified information must   execute a nondisclosure agreement on Standard Form 312--Classified  Information Nondisclosure Agreement. Persons not executing such  nondisclosure agreements are subject to sanctions of Executive Order  13292. It is the policy of the Farm Credit Administration that any  employee authorized access to classified information holds a personal  responsibility for safeguarding against unlawful disclosures, and such  employees are prohibited from disclosure without consent of the FCA  Information Security Officer. Any such unauthorized disclosure will be  reported to the Information Security Oversight Office, the Department of  Justice, the Department of State, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, and to any other Federal agency for which the Farm Credit  Administration has access to classified information, as such reportings  are subject to interpretation as required by statute and Executive  order. Any employee who knowingly disclosed classified information or  who refuses to cooperate with an investigation may be subject to  mandatory administrative sanctions, including as a minimum, denial of  further access to classified information. Further sanctions could  include demotion or dismissal depending on the circumstances of a  particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Freedom of Information request. All inquiries regarding requests  for classified information under the Freedom of Information Act (5  U.S.C. 552), including those from the news media, shall be referred to  the FCA FOI Officer, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, Farm  Credit Administration, and shall be handled in accordance with  provisions of that statute and applicable regulations.
