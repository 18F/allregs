                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Submission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any manufacturer or importer of a new  microorganism may request, under TSCA section 5(h)(4), an exemption, in  whole or in part, from this part by sending a Letter of Application in  the manner set forth in Sec. 725.25(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General provisions. The Letter of Application should provide  information to show that any activities affected by the requested  exemption will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or  the environment. This information should include data described in the  following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effects of the new microorganism on health and the  environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The magnitude of exposure of human beings and the environment  to the new microorganism.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The benefits of the new microorganism for various uses and the  availability of substitutes for such uses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of granting  or denying the exemption, including effects on the national economy,  small business, and technological innovation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specific requirements. In addition to the requirements of  paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the specific information requirements  of the relevant subpart under which the exemption is sought should be  met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exemption from MCAN reporting under subpart D. Information  requirements are set forth in Sec. Sec. 725.155 and 725.160.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exemption from TERA reporting under subpart E. Information  requirements are set forth in Sec. Sec. 725.255 and 725.260.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Listing a recipient microorganism as eligible for exemption  under subpart G. Information regarding the following criteria should be  addressed in an application to list a recipient microorganism under  Sec. 725.420:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identification and classification of the microorganism using  available genotypic and phenotypic information;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Information to evaluate the relationship of the microorganism to  any other closely related microorganisms which have a potential for  adverse effects on health or the environment;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A history of safe commercial use for the microorganism;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Commercial uses indicating that the microorganism products might  be subject to TSCA;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Studies which indicate the potential for the microorganism to  cause adverse effects to health or the environment; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Studies which indicate the survival characteristics of the  microorganism in the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Processing of the Letter of Application by EPA--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant of the  Application. If, after consideration of the Letter of Application and  any other relevant information available to EPA, the Assistant  Administrator for Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention makes a  preliminary determination that the new microorganism will not present an  unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Assistant  Administrator will propose a rule to grant the exemption using the  applicable procedures in part 750 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial of the application. If the Assistant Administrator  decides that the preliminary determination described in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section cannot be made, the application will be denied by  sending the applicant a written statement with the Assistant  Administrator's reasons for denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Processing of the exemption--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unreasonable risk standard.  Granting a section 5(h)(4) exemption requires a determination that the  activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or  the environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An unreasonable risk determination under the Act is an  administrative judgment that requires balancing of the harm to health or  the environment that a chemical substance may cause and the magnitude  and severity of that harm, against the social and economic effects on  society of EPA action to reduce that harm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A determination of unreasonable risk under section 5(h)(4) of  the Act will examine the reasonably ascertainable economic and social  consequences of granting or denying the exemption after consideration of  the effect on the national economy, small business, technological  innovation, the environment, and public health.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grant of the exemption. The exemption will be granted if the  Assistant Administrator determines, after consideration of all relevant  evidence presented in the rulemaking proceeding described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, that the new microorganism will not present an  unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Denial of the exemption. The exemption will be denied if the  Assistant Administrator determines, after consideration of all relevant  evidence presented in the rulemaking proceeding described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, that the determination described in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section cannot be made. A final decision terminating the  rulemaking proceeding will be published in the Federal Register.  [62 FR 17932, Apr. 11, 1997, as amended at 75 FR 789, Jan. 6, 2010; 77  FR 46292, Aug. 3, 2012]</p>
