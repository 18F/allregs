The IAF will announce any such change at  the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the  determination of the agency to open or close a meeting, or portion of a  meeting, to the public, may be changed only if a majority of the Board  of Directors determines by a recorded vote that IAF business so requires  and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the IAF  publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such  change at the earliest practicable time.</p>
