The Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods  for any actions required or permitted under these rules, necessary to  enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day time limit,  allowing whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers  necessary for the preparation of the decision after closing the record  and the filing of briefs, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Decisions in appeals considered under the SMALL CLAIMS  (EXPEDITED) procedure are rendered by a single Administrative Judge.  Written decisions of appeals considered under this procedure are short  and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. If there has  been a hearing on the appeal, the presiding Administrative Judge may, in  his or her discretion, hear closing oral arguments of the parties and  then render an oral decision on the appeal. Such decision will include  summary findings of fact and conclusions. Whenever such an oral decision  is rendered, the Board subsequently furnishes the parties with a written  transcript of the oral decision for record and payment purposes and to  commence the time period for the filing of a motion for reconsideration  under Rule 33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Decisions of the Board under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED)  procedure shall have no value as precedent. Except in cases of fraud,  decisions rendered under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure may not  be appealed by either party.</p>
