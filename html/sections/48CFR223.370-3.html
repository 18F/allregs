The manual contains mandatory safety requirements for  contractors. When work is to be performed on a Government-owned  installation, the contracting officer may use the ammunition and  explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation as a  substitute for, or supplement to, DoD Manual 4145.26-M, as long as the  contract cites these regulations.
