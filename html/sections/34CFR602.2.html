You may obtain a copy of the list from the Department at any time. The list is also available on the Department's web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Secretary denies continued recognition to a previously recognized agency, or if the Secretary limits, suspends, or terminates the agency's recognition before the end of its recognition period, the Secretary publishes a notice of that action in the Federal Register. The Secretary also makes the reasons for the action available to the public, on request.
