                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Charpy V-notch impact tests. Where required, Charpy V-notch  tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Specification E 23  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 54.01-1), ``Notched Bar Impact  Testing of Metallic Materials'', using the Type A specimen shown in  Figure 4 of the specification. Special attention is drawn to the fact  that the Charpy Keyhole and U-notch specimens are not acceptable  substitutes for the Charpy V-notch specimen and shall not be used to  qualify materials within the scope of this subpart. Each set of Charpy  impact tests shall consist of three specimens. For materials \1/2\-inch  thick or less, the largest possible Charpy specimens for that thickness  shall be cut centered at the material's mid-thickness. For materials  thicker than \1/2\-inch, full size Charpy specimens shall be cut  centered at a location as near as practicable to a point midway between  the material's surface and half-thickness. Except where otherwise  specified, transversely oriented specimens must be used. When  longitudinal specimens are used, the required energy values may not be  less than 1.5 times the values required for transversely oriented  specimens. In all cases the notch shall be cut normal to the material's  surface. Test specimens shall be taken at least one ``t'' from any heat  treated edge (where ``t'' is the material's nominal thickness).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drop weight tests. Where required, drop weight tests shall be  conducted for no-break performance in accordance with ASTM Specification  E 208 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 54.01-1), ``Conducting Drop- Weight Test to Determine Nil-Ductility Transition   Temperature of Ferritic Steels''. For material thicknesses between \1/ 2\-inch and \5/8\-inch, the ASTM E-208 specimen P-3, machined to \1/2\- inch thickness, shall be used with a stop distance of 0.090-inch. In  preparing weld specimens for dropweight testing, weld reinforcement  shall be ground flush, the hard facing bead centered on and transverse  to the weld, and the notch centered on and parallel to the weld axis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retest procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When Charpy V-notch impact specimens are  used and the average value of the three initial specimens fails to meet  the stated requirements by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, or the  value for more than one specimen is below the required average value of  when the value for one specimen is below the minimum value permitted for  a single specimen by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, three  additional specimens from the same material may be tested and the  results combined with those previously obtained to form a new average.  This new average of six specimens must exceed the specified minimum  average. In the event the Charpy retests fail, the material may still be  qualified by exhibiting a no-break performance when tested in accordance  with the drop weight procedure, if applicable. Two drop weight specimens  shall be tested for each Charpy V-notch set of three initial specimens  which failed to qualify. Failure of either or both of these drop weight  specimens will constitute rejection of the material or weldments  represented, except as outlined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When drop weight specimens are used, retests shall be permitted  only within the limits prescribed in ASTM Specification E 208  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 54.01-1), except as outlined in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, for heat treated base material, the required toughness  results are not obtained in the initial test or in the retest, the  material may be reheat treated one time and tested again in accordance  with the initial requirements for the material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternate toughness tests. The Charpy V-notch impact values of  Sec. Sec. 54.05-20(a) and 54.05-25(a) are representative of those which  correlate with the nil-ductility transition temperature determined by  the drop-weight tests for the steels specified in Sec. 54.25-10. For  materials for which there are other data showing suitable correlation  between Charpy V-notch and drop-weight tests, V-notch acceptance limits  different from those tabulated herein may be specially approved by the  Commandant, based upon the actual correlation. In the case of steels for  which the tabulated Charpy V-notch values can be shown to be  inapplicable or in the case of specially considered steels, or as an  alternative to complying with the tabulated impact requirements,  acceptance may be based upon the material exhibiting a no-break  performance when tested in accordance with the drop-weight procedure.  Whenever the drop-weight test is used as an alternative to the Charpy V- notch test, two drop-weight specimens shall be tested for each set of  three Charpy V-notch specimens otherwise required. If the drop-weight  test cannot be performed because of material thickness limitations (less  than one-half inch) or product shape, or is otherwise inapplicable  (because of heat treatment, chemistry, etc.), other tests and/or test  criteria will be specified by the Commandant to assure the adequacy of  the material for the intended application.
