                                Sec. 531.27  Payment in cash or its equivalent required.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standing alone, sections 6 and 7 of the Act require payments of  the prescribed wages, including overtime compensation, in cash or  negotiable instrument payable at par. Section 3(m) provides, however,  for the inclusion in the ``wage'' paid to any employee, under the  conditions which it prescribes of the ``reasonable cost,'' or ``fair  value'' as determined by the Secretary, of furnishing such employee with  board, lodging, or other facilities. In addition, section 3(m) provides  that a tipped employee's wages may consist in part of tips. It is  section 3(m) which permits and governs the payment of wages in other  than cash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It should not be assumed that because the term ``wage'' does not  appear in section 7, all overtime compensation must be paid in cash and  may not be paid in board, lodging, or other facilities. There appears to  be no evidence in either the statute or its legislative history which  demonstrates the intention to provide one rule for the payment of the  minimum wage and another rule for the payment of overtime compensation.  The principles stated in paragraph (a) of this section are considered  equally applicable to payment of the minimum hourly wage required by  section 6 or of the wages required by the equal pay provisions of  section 6(d), and to payment, when overtime is worked, of the  compensation required by section 7. Thus, in determining whether he has  met the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act, the employer  may credit himself with the reasonable cost to himself of board,  lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by him to his  employees when the cost of such board, lodging, or other facilities is  not excluded from wages paid to such employees under the term of a bona  fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the employees. Unless  the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term ``wage'' is used in  this part to designate the amount due under either section 6 or section  7 without distinction. It should be remembered, however, that the wage  paid for a job, within the meaning of the equal pay provisions of  section 6(d), may include remuneration for employment which is not  included in the employee's regular rate of pay under section 7(e) of the  act or is not allocable to compensation for hours of work required by  the minimum wage provisions of section 6. Reference should be made to  parts 778 and 800 of this chapter for a more detailed discussion of the  applicable principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tips may be credited or offset against the wages payable under  the Act in certain circumstances, as discussed later in this subpart.  See also the recordkeeping requirements contained in part 516 of this  chapter.</p>
