                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Amount of recovery. The amount of recovery for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1332(a). See paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1332-1. If, pursuant to the taxpayer's election under section 1335, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year in which he recovers the same war loss property, the fair market value of such property shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be considered an amount equal to the adjusted basis (for determining loss) of such property in the hands of the taxpayer on the date such property was considered as destroyed or seized. This option is exercisable by the taxpayer with respect to each separate war loss property. Also, if the provisions of section 1333 are applicable pursuant to the taxpayer's election, the amount of the recovery of any money or property in respect of war loss property shall be reduced for the purpose of section 1333 (2) and (3) by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to such property, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under section 127(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property, and such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied before the date of the recovery. See 26 CFR (1939) 29.127(b)-1 (Regulations 111).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Elective method; tax adjustment measured by prior benefits. (1) If the taxpayer elects pursuant to section 1335 and in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.1335-1 to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovers any money or property in respect of war loss property, the amount of the recovery in respect of such property for any taxable year shall not be included in income until the taxpayer has recovered an amount equal to his allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property, whether or not such allowable deductions resulted in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. However, for the purposes of section 6012(a)(1), relating to the requirement of individual returns, section 6012(a)(2), relating to the requirement of corporation returns, and section 1312, relating to the mitigation of the effect of the statute of limitations, the entire amount of the recovery shall be deemed to be an item includible in

gross income for the taxable year in which the recovery is made. In lieu of including such amount in gross income, there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year of the recovery an adjustment on account of any tax benefits in all prior taxable years resulting directly or indirectly from the fact that the loss from the destruction or seizure of such property was an allowable deduction. The amount of such adjustment shall be the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing such allowable deductions with respect to the destruction or seizure of such property by an amount equal to that portion of the amount of the recovery which is not included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery. The portion of the amount of the recovery which is in excess of such allowable deductions is included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and is recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033. See section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. Such gain, if recognized, is included in gross income as ordinary income unless section 1231(a) applies to cause such gain to be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than six months. See section 1231(a) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the taxpayer elects pursuant to section 1335 and in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.1335-1 to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovers any money or property in respect of war loss property, the amount of the recovery in respect of such property for any taxable year shall not be included in income until the taxpayer has recovered an amount equal to his allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property, whether or not such allowable deductions resulted in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

gross income for the taxable year in which the recovery is made. In lieu of including such amount in gross income, there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year of the recovery an adjustment on account of any tax benefits in all prior taxable years resulting directly or indirectly from the fact that the loss from the destruction or seizure of such property was an allowable deduction. The amount of such adjustment shall be the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing such allowable deductions with respect to the destruction or seizure of such property by an amount equal to that portion of the amount of the recovery which is not included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery. The portion of the amount of the recovery which is in excess of such allowable deductions is included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and is recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033. See section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. Such gain, if recognized, is included in gross income as ordinary income unless section 1231(a) applies to cause such gain to be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than six months. See section 1231(a) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The determination as to whether and to what extent the amount of the recovery is to be excluded from gross income is to be made upon the basis of the total amount of the recoveries in each taxable year in respect of the same war loss property, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the recovery in any taxable year is excluded from the gross income of such year and is not considered gain on an involuntary conversion to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property (whether or not such deductions resulted in a reduction of a tax of the taxpayer) reduced by the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the recovery in any taxable year which is not excluded from gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is included in gross income and is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. The following provisions apply to this gain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Such gain is recognized or not recognized under the provisions of section 1033, relating to gain on the involuntary conversion of property. For the purpose of applying section 1033, such gain for any taxable year is deemed to be expended in the manner provided in section 1033 to the extent the recovery in such taxable year is so expended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If such gain is recognized it is included in gross income as ordinary income or, if the provisions of section 1231(a) apply and require such treatment, as gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months. In the case of the recovery of the same war loss property, any gain will not be deemed to be recognized under the provisions of section 1231(a) if such property is used for the same purpose for which it was used before it was deemed destroyed or seized under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The determination of the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing the deductions allowable in any prior taxable year with respect to the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which the taxpayer has made a recovery by an amount equal to the part of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery shall be made as provided in this subparagraph. Such total increase shall include the increases described in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, and shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax under subtitle A for the taxable year of the recovery. Proper adjustment of such increases shall be made on account of the application of the

provisions of this subparagraph to intervening taxable years. Proper adjustment shall also be made in the determination of such increases in the case of a taxpayer who has made a valid election under section 1020, relating to the adjustment of basis of property for depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion. The term tax previously determined as used in this subparagraph shall have the same meaning as used in section 1314(a) and shall include any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In computing the amount of the increase in the tax previously determined under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year, the principles of section 1314(a) shall be applicable. See section 1314(a) and the regulations thereunder. However, the computation of the excess profits credit under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year shall not be affected by the adjustment provided in this subparagraph. All credits allowable against the tax for any year shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax previously determined. The increases referred to above include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for each prior taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable deduction (to the extent that it does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures or accruals in such prior taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or section 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or section 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which a net operating loss deduction was allowable, if all or a part of such deduction was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of a net operating loss from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction. In the determination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss shall be recomputed by disregarding the deduction allowable on account of the war loss in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing

the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the recomputation such carryover or carryback shall be redetermined by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of the recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase in the tax previously determined shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which there was allowable a net operating loss deduction attributable to the carryover or carryback to such other taxable year of a net operating loss, and such net operating loss resulted in whole or in part from the deduction allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction and such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the redetermination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss carryover or carryback shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback shall then be recomputed to conform to the redetermination of the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year from which the unused credit is carried over or carried back. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed shall be the amount of the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of

the recovery. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of the recovery shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.
