                            <p class="depth0">According to section 12(a) goods produced in an establishment in or about which oppressive child labor has been employed are barred as ``hot goods'' from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce in the following two situations: First, if they were removed from the establishment while any oppressive child labor was still being employed in or about it; second, if they were removed from an establishment in or about which oppressive child labor was no longer employed but less than 30 days had then elapsed since any such employment of oppressive child labor came to an end. Once any goods have been removed from a producing establishment within the above-mentioned thirty-day period, they are barred at any time theafter from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce so long as they remain ``goods'' for purposes of the Act. \21\ Goods are considered removed from an establishment just as soon as they are taken away from the establishment as that term has been defined. \22\ The statute does not require that this ``removal'' from the establishment be made for the purpose or in the course of a shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce. A ``removal'' within the meaning of the statute also takes place where the goods are removed from the establishment for some other purpose such as storage, the granting of a lien or other security interest, or further processing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\21\ However, section 12(a) contains a provision relieving innocent purchasers from liability thereunder provided certain conditions are met. For a discussion of this provision, see Sec. 570.141.</p><p class="depth0">\22\ For a discussion of the meaning of ``establishment,'' see Sec. 570.109.</p><p class="depth0">\23\ [Reserved]
