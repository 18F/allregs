A designee of the listed entities is  any individual the Federal or state fishery agency or other co-manager  has authorized in writing to perform the listed functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to fishery harvest  activities provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fisheries are managed in accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery  Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP) and implemented in accordance with  a letter of concurrence from NMFS. NMFS will approve an FMEP only if it  clearly defines its intended scope and area of impact and sets forth the  management objectives and performance indicators for the plan. The plan  must adequately address the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Define populations within affected listed ESUs, taking into  account spatial and temporal distribution, genetic and phenotypic  diversity, and other appropriate identifiably unique biological and life  history traits. Populations may be aggregated for management purposes  when dictated by information scarcity, if consistent with survival and  recovery of the listed ESU. In identifying management units, the plan  shall describe the reasons for using such units in lieu of population  units, describe how the management units are defined, given biological  and life history traits, so as to maximize consideration of the  important biological diversity contained within the listed ESU, respond  to the scale and complexity of the ESU, and help ensure consistent  treatment of listed salmonids across a diverse geographic and  jurisdictional range.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Utilize the concepts of ``viable'' and ``critical'' salmonid  population thresholds, consistent with the concepts contained in the  technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations (NMFS,  2000b).'' The VSP paper provides a framework for identifying the  biological requirements of listed salmonids, assessing the effects of  management and conservation actions, and ensuring that such actions  provide for the survival and recovery of listed species. Proposed  management actions must recognize the significant differences in risk  associated with viable and critical population threshold states and  respond accordingly to minimize the long-term risks to population  persistence. Harvest actions impacting populations that are functioning  at or above the viable threshold must be designed to maintain the  population or management unit at or above that level. For populations  shown with a high degree of confidence to be above critical levels but  not yet at viable levels, harvest management must not appreciably slow  the population's achievement of viable function. Harvest actions  impacting populations that are functioning at or below critical  threshold must not be allowed to appreciably increase genetic and  demographic risks facing the population and must be designed to permit  the population's achievement of viable function, unless the plan  demonstrates that the likelihood of survival and recovery of the entire  ESU in the wild would not be appreciably reduced by greater risks to  that individual population.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Set escapement objectives or maximum exploitation rates for each  management unit or population based on its status and on a harvest  program that assures that those rates or objectives are not exceeded.  Maximum exploitation rates must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of  survival and recovery of the ESU. Management of fisheries where  artificially propagated fish predominate must not compromise the  management objectives for commingled naturally spawned populations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Display a biologically based rationale demonstrating that the  harvest management strategy will not appreciably reduce the likelihood  of survival and recovery of the ESU in the wild, over the entire period  of time the proposed harvest management strategy affects the population,  including effects reasonably certain to occur after the proposed actions  cease.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Include effective monitoring and evaluation programs to assess  compliance, effectiveness, and parameter validation. At a minimum,  harvest monitoring programs must collect catch and   effort data, information on escapements, and information on biological  characteristics, such as age, fecundity, size and sex data, and  migration timing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Provide for evaluating monitoring data and making any revisions  of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data show are  needed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Provide for effective enforcement and education. Coordination  among involved jurisdictions is an important element in ensuring  regulatory effectiveness and coverage.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Include restrictions on resident and anadromous species  fisheries that minimize any take of listed species, including time,  size, gear, and area restrictions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Be consistent with plans and conditions established within any  Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal  harvest allocations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids  occurring in its fisheries and provides to NMFS on a regular basis, as  defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence for the FMEP, a report  summarizing this information, as well as the implementation and  effectiveness of the FMEP. The state shall provide NMFS with access to  all data and reports prepared concerning the implementation and  effectiveness of the FMEP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The state confers with NMFS on its fishing regulation changes  affecting listed ESUs to ensure consistency with the approved FMEP.  Prior to approving a new or amended FMEP, NMFS will publish notification  in the Federal Register announcing its availability for public review  and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period on  the draft FMEP of not less than 30 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> NMFS provides written concurrence of the FMEP which specifies  the implementation and reporting requirements. NMFS' approval of a plan  shall be a written approval by NMFS Southwest or Northwest Regional  Administrator, as appropriate. On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate  the effectiveness of the program in protecting and achieving a level of  salmonid productivity commensurate with conservation of the listed  salmonids. If it is not, NMFS will identify ways in which the program  needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible agency does not  make changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will  publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to  withdraw the limit for activities associated with that FMEP. Such an  announcement will provide for a comment period of not less than 30 days,  after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to withdraw the  limit so that the prohibitions would then apply to those fishery harvest  activities. A template for developing FMEPs is available from NMFS  Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to activity  associated with artificial propagation programs provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A state or Federal Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP)  has been approved by NMFS as meeting the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The HGMP has clearly stated goals, performance objectives, and  performance indicators that indicate the purpose of the program, its  intended results, and measurements of its performance in meeting those  results. Goals shall address whether the program is intended to meet  conservation objectives, contribute to the ultimate sustainability of  natural spawning populations, and/or intended to augment tribal,  recreational, or commercial fisheries. Objectives should enumerate the  results desired from the program that will be used to measure the  program's success or failure.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The HGMP utilizes the concepts of viable and critical salmonid  population threshold, consistent with the concepts contained in the  technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations'' (NMFS,  2000b). Listed salmonids may be purposefully taken for broodstock  purposes only if the donor population is currently at or above the  viable threshold and the collection will not impair its function; if   the donor population is not currently viable but the sole objective of  the current collection program is to enhance the propagation or survival  of the listed ESU; or if the donor population is shown with a high  degree of confidence to be above critical threshold although not yet  functioning at viable levels, and the collection will not appreciably  slow the attainment of viable status for that population.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Taking into account health, abundances, and trends in the donor  population, broodstock collection programs reflect appropriate  priorities. The primary purpose of broodstock collection programs of  listed species is to reestablish indigenous salmonid populations for  conservation purposes. Such programs include restoration of similar, at- risk populations within the same ESU, and reintroduction of at-risk  populations to underseeded habitat. After the species' conservation  needs are met and when consistent with survival and recovery of the ESU,  broodstock collection programs may be authorized by NMFS such for  secondary purposes, as to sustain tribal, recreational, and commercial  fisheries.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The HGMP includes protocols to address fish health, broodstock  collection, broodstock spawning, rearing and release of juveniles,  deposition of hatchery adults, and catastrophic risk management.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The HGMP evaluates, minimizes, and accounts for the propagation  program's genetic and ecological effects on natural populations,  including disease transfer, competition, predation, and genetic  introgression caused by the straying of hatchery fish.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The HGMP describes interrelationships and interdependencies with  fisheries management. The combination of artificial propagation programs  and harvest management must be designed to provide as many benefits and  as few biological risks as possible for the listed species. For programs  whose purpose is to sustain fisheries, HGMPs must not compromise the  ability of FMEPs or other management plans to conserve listed salmonids.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Adequate artificial propagation facilities exist to properly  rear progeny of naturally spawned broodstock, to maintain population  health and diversity, and to avoid hatchery-influenced selection or  domestication.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Adequate monitoring and evaluation exist to detect and evaluate  the success of the hatchery program and any risks potentially impairing  the recovery of the listed ESU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> The HGMP provides for evaluating monitoring data and making any  revisions of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data  show are needed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> NMFS provides written concurrence of the HGMP which specifies  the implementation and reporting requirements. For Federally operated or  funded hatcheries, the ESA section 7 consultation will achieve this  purpose.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> The HGMP is consistent with plans and conditions set within any  Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal  harvest allocations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids  occurring in its hatchery program and provides to NMFS on a regular  basis a report summarizing this information, and the implementation and  effectiveness of the HGMP as defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence. The  state shall provide NMFS with access to all data and reports prepared  concerning the implementation and effectiveness of the HGMP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The state confers with NMFS on a regular basis regarding  intended collections of listed broodstock to ensure congruity with the  approved HGMP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prior to final approval of an HGMP, NMFS will publish  notification in the Federal Register announcing its availability for  public review and comment for a period of at least 30 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> NMFS' approval of a plan shall be a written approval by NMFS  Southwest or Northwest Regional Administrator, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the  HGMP in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity  commensurate with the conservation of the listed salmonids. If the HGMP  is not effective, the NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in  which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. If the  responsible agency does not make   changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish  notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to  withdraw the limit on activities associated with that program. Such an  announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days,  after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to withdraw the  limit so that take prohibitions, likeall other activity not within a  limit, would then apply to that program. A template for developing HGMPs  is available from NMFS Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to actions undertaken  in compliance with a resource management plan developed jointly by the  States of Washington, Oregon and/or Idaho and the Tribes (joint plan)  within the continuing jurisdiction of United States v. Washington or  United States v. Oregon, the on-going Federal court proceedings to  enforce and implement reserved treaty fishing rights, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary has determined pursuant to 50 CFR 223.209 and the  government-to-government processes therein that implementing and  enforcing the joint tribal/state plan will not appreciably reduce the  likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The joint plan will be implemented and enforced within the  parameters set forth in United States v. Washington or United States v.  Oregon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In making that determination for a joint plan, the Secretary  has taken comment on how any fishery management plan addresses the  criteria in Sec.  223.203(b)(4), or on how any hatchery and genetic  management plan addresses the criteria in Sec.  223.203(b)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of  any determination whether or not a joint plan, will appreciably reduce  the likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs,  together with a discussion of the biological analysis underlying that  determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the  joint plan in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity  commensurate with conservation of the listed salmonids. If the plan is  not effective, then NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which  the joint plan needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible  agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the new  information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register  announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated  with that joint plan. Such an announcement will provide for a comment  period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final  determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions  would then apply to that joint plan as to all other activity not within  a limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to scientific  research activities provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scientific research activities involving purposeful take is  conducted by employees or contractors of the ODFW, WDFW (Agencies),  IDFG, or CDFG (Agencies), or as a part of a monitoring and research  program overseen by or coordinated with that Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Agencies provide for NMFS' review and approval a list of  all scientific research activities involving direct take planned for the  coming year, including an estimate of the total direct take that is  anticipated, a description of the study design, including a  justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques  to be used, and a point of contact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Agencies annually provide to NMFS the results of  scientific research activities directed at threatened salmonids,  including a report of the direct take resulting from the studies and a  summary of the results of such studies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Scientific research activities that may incidentally take  threatened salmonids are either conducted by   agency personnel, or are in accord with a permit issued by the Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Agencies provide NMFS annually, for its review and approval,  a report listing all scientific research activities it conducts or  permits that may incidentally take threatened salmonids during the  coming year.

If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to  respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time  feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will publish notification in  the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit so  that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all other  activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for a   comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a  final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section  9(a)(1) prohibitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to municipal,  residential, commercial, and industrial (MRCI) development (including  redevelopment) activities provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such development occurs pursuant to city, county, or regional  government ordinances or plans that NMFS has determined are adequately  protective of listed species; or within the jurisdiction of the Metro  regional government in Oregon and pursuant to ordinances that Metro has  found comply with its Urban Growth Management Functional Plan  (Functional Plan) following a determination by NMFS that the Functional  Plan is adequately protective. NMFS approval or determinations about any  MRCI development ordinances or plans, including the Functional Plan,  shall be a written approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional  Administrator, whichever is appropriate. NMFS will apply the following  12 evaluation considerations when reviewing MRCI development ordinances  or plans to assess whether they adequately conserve listed salmonids by  maintaining and restoring properly functioning habitat conditions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that development will  avoid inappropriate areas such as unstable slopes, wetlands, areas of  high habitat value, and similarly constrained sites.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately avoids stormwater  discharge impacts to water quality and quantity or to the hydrograph of  the watershed, including peak and base flows of perennial streams.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan provides adequately  protective riparian area management requirements to attain or maintain  PFC around all rivers, estuaries, streams, lakes, deepwater habitats,  and intermittent streams. Compensatory mitigation is provided, where  necessary, to offset unavoidable damage to PFC due to MRCI development  impacts to riparian management areas.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan avoids stream crossings by  roads, utilities, and other linear development wherever possible, and,  where crossings must be provided, minimize impacts through choice of  mode, sizing, and placement.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects  historical stream meander patterns and channel migration zones and  avoids hardening of stream banks and shorelines.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects wetlands  and wetland functions, including isolated wetlands.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately preserves the  hydrologic capacity of permanent and intermittent streams to pass peak  flows.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions  for landscaping with native vegetation to reduce need for watering and  application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions  to prevent erosion and sediment run-off during construction.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that water supply  demands can be met without impacting flows needed for threatened  salmonids either directly or through groundwater withdrawals and that  any new water diversions are positioned and screened in a way that  prevents injury or death of salmonids.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> MRCI development ordinance or plan provides necessary  enforcement, funding, reporting, and implementation mechanisms and  formal plan evaluations at intervals that do not exceed 5 years.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> MRCI development ordinance and plan complies with all other  state and Federal environmental and natural resource laws and permits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The city, county or regional government provides NMFS with  annual reports regarding implementation and   effectiveness of the ordinances, including: any water quality monitoring  information the jurisdiction has available; aerial photography (or some  other graphic display) of each MRCI development or MRCI expansion area  at sufficient detail to demonstrate the width and vegetation condition  of riparian set-backs; information to demonstrate the success of  stormwater management and other conservation measures; and a summary of  any flood damage, maintenance problems, or other issues.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NMFS finds the MRCI development activity to be consistent with  the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes to the  attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained  presence of a watershed's habitat-forming processes that are necessary  for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of  environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not  impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning  of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of  impaired habitat toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an  approved program for its effectiveness in maintaining and achieving  habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids.  Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which  the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be  identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions,  or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally  targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels  needed to conserve the ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does  not make changes to respond adequately to the new information in the  shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will  publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to  withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then apply to the  program as to all other activity not within a limit. Such an  announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days,  after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the  activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) prohibitions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prior to approving any city, county, or regional government  ordinances or plans as within this limit, or approving any substantive  change in an ordinance or plan within this limit, NMFS will publish  notification in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the  ordinance or plan or the draft changes for public review and comment.  Such an announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than  30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to  the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of the genus  Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to non-Federal forest  management activities conducted in the State of Washington provided  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The action is in compliance with forest practice regulations  adopted and implemented by the Washington Forest Practices Board that  NMFS has found are at least as protective of habitat functions as are  the regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report dated April 29,  1999, and submitted to the Forest Practices Board by a consortium of  landowners, tribes, and state and Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All non-regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report are  being implemented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Actions involving use of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides  are not included within this limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Actions taken under alternative plans are included in this  limit provided that the Washington Department of Natural Resources  (WDNR) finds that the alternate plans protect physical and biological  processes at least as well as the state forest practices rules and  provided that NMFS, or any resource agency or tribe NMFS designates, has  the opportunity to review the plan at every stage of the development and  implementation. A plan may be excluded from this limit if, after such  review, WDNR determines that the plan is not likely to adequately  protect listed salmon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Prior to determining that regulations adopted by the Forest  Practice Board are at least as protective as the   elements of the Forests and Fish Report, NMFS will publish notification  in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the Report and  regulations for public review and comment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> NMFS finds the activities to be consistent with the  conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by contributing to the  attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained  presence of a watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are  necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range  of environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must  not impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the  functioning of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term  progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. Programs must meet this  biological standard in order for NMFS to find they qualify for a  habitat-related limit. NMFS uses the best available science to make  these determinations. NMFS may review and revise previous findings as  new scientific information becomes available. NMFS will evaluate the  effectiveness of the program in maintaining and achieving habitat  function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. If the  program is not adequate, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in  which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be  identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions or  where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally  targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels  needed to conserve the ESU. If Washington does not make changes to  respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish  notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to  withdraw the limit on activities associated with the program. Such an  announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days,  after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the  activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) take prohibitions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> NMFS approval of regulations shall be a written approval by  NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Affirmative Defense. In connection with any action alleging a  violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with  respect to the threatened West Coast salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs (of  the genus Oncorhynchus) listed in Sec.  223.102, any person claiming the  benefit of any limit listed in paragraph (b) of this section or Sec.   223.204(a) shall have a defense where the person can demonstrate that  the limit is applicable and was in force, and that the person fully  complied with the limit at the time of the alleged violation. This  defense is an affirmative defense that must be raised, pleaded, and  proven by the proponent. If proven, this defense will be an absolute  defense to liability under section 9(a)(1)(G) of the ESA with respect to  the alleged violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Severability. The provisions of this section and the various  applications thereof are distinct and severable from one another.
