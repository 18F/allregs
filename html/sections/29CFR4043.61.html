                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Unless a waiver or extension applies with respect to the plan, each contributing sponsor of a plan for which a reportable event under this subpart is going to occur is required to notify the PBGC no later than 30 days before the effective date of the reportable event if the contributing sponsor is subject to advance reporting. If there is a change in contributing sponsor, the reporting obligation applies to the person who is the contributing sponsor of the plan on the notice date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons subject to advance reporting. A contributing sponsor is subject to the advance reporting requirement under paragraph (a) of this section if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Neither the contributing sponsor nor the member of the plan's controlled group to which the event relates is a public company; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contributing sponsor is a member of a controlled group maintaining one or more plans that, in the aggregate (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) have--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vested benefits amounts that exceed the actuarial values of plan assets by more than $50 million; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A funded vested benefit percentage of less than 90 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Funding determinations.
