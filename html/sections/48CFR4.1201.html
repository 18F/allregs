The representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to SAM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When any of the conditions in paragraph (b) of the clause at 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, apply, contractors that represented they were small businesses prior to award of a contract must update the representations and certifications in SAM as directed by the clause. Contractors that represented they were other than small businesses prior to award of a contract may update the representations and certifications in SAM as directed by the clause, if their size status has changed since contract award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Data in SAM is archived and is electronically retrievable. Therefore, when a prospective contractor has completed representations and certifications electronically via SAM, the contracting officer must reference the date of SAM verification in the contract file, or include a paper copy of the electronically-submitted representations and certifications in the file. Either of these actions satisfies contract file documentation requirements of 4.803(a)(11). However, if an offeror identifies changes to SAM data pursuant to the FAR provisions at 52.204-8(d) or 52.212-3(b), the contracting officer must include a copy of the changes in the contract file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The contracting officer shall incorporate the representations and certifications by reference in the contract (see 52.204-19, or for acquisitions of commercial items see 52.212-4(v)).
