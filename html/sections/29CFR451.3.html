                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Organizations which deal with employers. (1) The term ``labor  organization'' includes ``any organization of any kind, any agency, or  employee representation committee, group, association, or plan * * * in  which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole  or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor  disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of  employment, * * *.'' The quoted language is deemed sufficiently broad to  encompass any labor organization irrespective of size or formal  attributes. While it is necessary for employees to participate therein,  such participating employees need not necessarily be the employees of  the employer with whom the organization deals. In determining who are  ``employees'' for purposes of this provision, resort must be had to the  broad definition of ``employee'' contained in section 3(f) of the Act.  \5\ It will be noted that the term includes employees whose work has  ceased for certain specified reasons, including any current labor  dispute. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Sec. 3(f) reads: `` `Employee' means any individual employed by  an employer, and includes any individual whose work has ceased as a  consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or  because of any unfair labor practice or because of exclusion or  expulsion from a labor organization in any manner or for any reason  inconsistent with the requirements of this Act.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To come within the quoted language in section 3(i) the  organization must exist for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing  with employers concerning grievances, etc. In determining whether a  given organization exists wholly or partially for such purpose,  consideration will be given not only to formal documents, such as its  constitution or bylaws, but the actual functions and practices of the  organization as well. Thus, employee committees which regularly meet  with management to discuss problems of mutual interest and handle  grievances are ``labor organizations'', even though they have no formal  organizational structure. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ National Labor Relations Board v. Cabot Carbon Co., 360 U.S.  203. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Since the types of labor organizations described in subparagraph  (2) of this paragraph are those which deal with employers, it is  necessary to consider the definition of ``employer'' contained in  section 3(e) of the Act in determining the scope of the language under  consideration. \7\ The term ``employer'' is broadly defined to include  ``any employer or any group or association of employers engaged in an  industry affecting commerce'' which is ``an employer within the meaning  of any law of the United States relating to the employment of any  employees * * *.'' Such laws would include, among others, the Railway  Labor Act, as amended, the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, the  Labor Management Relations Act, as amended, and the Internal Revenue  Code. The fact that employers may be excluded from the application of  any of the foregoing acts would not preclude their qualification as  employers for purposes of this Act. For example, employers of  agricultural labor who are excluded from the application of the Labor  Management Relations Act, as amended, would appear to be employers  within the meaning of this Act. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> which is, with respect to employees engaged in an industry affecting  commerce, an employer within the meaning of any law of the United States  relating to the employment of any employees or (2) which may deal with  any labor organization concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages,  rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work, and includes  any person acting directly or indirectly as an employer or as an agent  of an employer in relation to an employee but does not include the  United States or any corporation wholly owned by the Government of the  United States or any State or political subdivision thereof.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In defining ``employer,'' section 3(e) expressly excludes the  ``United States or any corporation wholly owned by the Government of the  United States or any State or political   subdivision thereof.'' The term ``political subdivision'' includes,  among others, counties and municipal governments. A labor organization  composed entirely of employees of the governmental entities excluded by  section 3(e) would not be a labor organization for the purposes of the  Act with the exception of a labor organization composed of employees of  the United States Postal Service which is subject to the Act by virtue  of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. (Organizations composed of  Federal government employees that meet the definition of ``labor  organization'' in the Civil Service Reform Act or the Foreign Service  Act are subject to the standards of conduct requirements of those Acts,  5 U.S.C. 7120 and 22 U.S.C. 4117, respectively. In addition, labor  organizations subject to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995  are subject to the standards of conduct provisions of the Civil Service  Reform Act pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 1351(a)(1). The regulations implementing  the standards of conduct requirements are contained in parts 457-459 of  this title.) However, in the case of a national, international or  intermediate labor organization composed both of government locals and  non-government or mixed locals, the parent organization as well as its  mixed and non-government locals would be ``labor organizations'' and  subject to the Act. In such case, the locals which are composed entirely  of government employees would not be subject to the Act, although  elections in which they participate for national officers or delegates  would be so subject. \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ See also, Sec. 452.12 of this chapter which discusses the  election provisions of the Act. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Organizations which may or may not deal with employers.  Regardless of whether it deals with employers concerning terms and  conditions of employment and regardless of whether it is composed of  employees, any conference, general committee, joint or system board, or  joint council engaged in an industry affecting commerce and which is  subordinate to a national or international labor organization is a  ``labor organization'' for purposes of the Act. Included are the area  conferences and the joint councils of the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters and similar units of other national and international labor  organizations.
