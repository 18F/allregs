                            <p class="depth0">Section 7(e) of the Act requires the inclusion in the regular rate  of all remuneration for employment except eight specified types of  payments. Among these excludable payments are discretionary bonuses,  gifts and payments in the nature of gifts on special occasions,  contributions by the employer to certain welfare plans and payments made  by the employer pursuant to certain profit-sharing, thrift and savings  plans. These are discussed in Sec. Sec. 778.211 through 778.214.  Bonuses which do not qualify for exclusion from the regular rate as one  of these types must be totaled in with other earnings to determine the  regular rate on which overtime pay must be based. Bonus payments are  payments made in addition to the regular earnings of an employee. For a  discussion on the bonus form as an evasive bookkeeping device, see  Sec. Sec. 778.502 and 778.503.
