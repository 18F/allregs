                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Extent of SBA guarantee. With respect to Individual  Certificates, SBA guarantees to purchase from the Registered Holder the  guaranteed portion of the loan for an amount equal to the unpaid  principal and accrued interest due as of the date of SBA's purchase,  less deductions for applicable fees. Unlike the SBA guarantee with  respect to pooled loans, SBA does not guarantee timely payment on  Individual Certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What triggers the SBA guarantee. SBA's guarantee to the  Registered Holder may be called upon when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Borrower remains in uncured default for 60 days on payments  of principal or interest due on the note;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Lender fails to send to the FTA on a timely basis payments  it received from the Borrower; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FTA fails to send to the Registered Holder on a timely basis  any payments it has received from the Lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Full faith and credit. SBA's guarantee to the Registered Holder  is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Pool Assemblers</p>
