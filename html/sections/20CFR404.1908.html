                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To have foreign periods of coverage combined with U.S.  periods of coverage for purposes of determining entitlement to and the  amount of benefits payable under title II, an individual must have at  least 6 quarters of coverage, as defined in section 213 of the Social  Security Act, under the U.S. system. As a rule, SSA will accept foreign  coverage information, as certified by the foreign country's agency,  unless otherwise specified by the agreement. No credit will be given,  however, for periods of coverage acquired before January 1, 1937.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For quarters of coverage purposes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally, a quarter of  coverage (QC) will be credited for every 3 months (or equivalent  period), or remaining fraction of 3 months, of coverage in a reporting  period certified to SSA by the other country's agency. A reporting  period used by a foreign country may be one calendar year or some   other period of time. QCs based on foreign periods of coverage may be  credited as QCs only to calendar quarters not already QCs under title  II. The QCs will be assigned chronologically beginning with the first  calendar quarter (not already a QC under title II) within the reporting  period and continuing until all the QCs are assigned, or the reporting  period ends. Example: Country XYZ, which has an annual reporting period,  certifies to SSA that a worker has 8 months of coverage in 1975, from  January 1 to August 25. The worker has no QCs under title II in that  year. Since 8 months divided by 3 months equals 2 QCs with a remainder  of 2 months, the U.S. will credit the worker with 3 QCs. The QCs will be  credited to the first 3 calendar quarters in 1975.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an individual fails to meet the requirements for currently  insured status or the insured status needed for establishing a period of  disability solely because of the assignment of QCs based on foreign  coverage to calendar quarters chronologically, the QCs based on foreign  coverage may be assigned to different calendar quarters within the  beginning and ending dates of the reporting period certified by the  foreign country, but only as permitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p>
