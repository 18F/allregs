                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act, and will be issued for all contracts entered  into under which more than 5 service employees are to be employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As described in subpart B of this part--Wage Determination  Procedures, two types of wage determinations are issued under the Act:  Prevailing in the locality or Collective Bargaining Agreement  (Successorship) wage determinations. The facts related to a specific  solicitation and contract will determine the type of wage determination  applicable to that procurement. In addition, different types of  prevailing wage determinations may be issued depending upon the nature  of the contract. While prevailing wage determinations based upon cross- industry survey data are applicable to most contracts covered by the  Act, in some cases the Department of Labor may issue industry specific  wage determinations for application to specific types of service  contracts. In   addition, the geographic scope of contracts is often different and the  geographic scope of the underlying survey data for the wage  determinations applicable to those contracts may be different.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. The wage rates and fringe benefits  so determined for any class of service employees to be engaged in  furnishing covered contract services in a locality shall be made  applicable by contract to all service employees of such class employed  to perform such services in the locality under any contract subject to  section 2(a) of the Act which is entered into thereafter and before such  determination has been rendered obsolete by a withdrawal, modification,  revision, or supersedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Generally, wage determinations issued for solicitations or  negotiations for any contract where the place of performance is unknown  will contain minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits for the various  geographic localities where the work may be performed which were  identified in the initial solicitation. (See Sec. 4.4(a)(3)(i).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wage determinations will be available for public inspection  during business hours at the Wage and Hour Division, Employment  Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC, and  copies will be made available on request at Regional Offices of the Wage  and Hour Division. In addition, most prevailing wage determinations are  available online from WDOL. Archived versions of SCA wage determinations  that are no longer current may be accessed in the ``Archived SCA WD''  database of WDOL for information purposes only. Contracting officers  should not use an archived wage determination in a contract action  without prior approval of the Department of Labor.
