                            <p class="depth0">An acquisition of voting securities shall be exempt from the  notification requirements of the act if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The securities are acquired by a trust that meets the  qualifications of section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The trust is controlled by a person that employs the  beneficiaries and,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The voting securities acquired are those of that person or an  entity within that person.</p><p class="depth2">Examples: 1. Company A establishes a trust for its employees that  meets the qualifications of section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Company A has the power to designate the trustee of the trust. That  trust then acquires 30% of the voting securities of Company A for in  excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Later, the trust acquires 20% of  the stock of Company B, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company A, for in  excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Neither acquisition is reportable.</p><p class="depth2">2. Assume that in the example above, ``A'' has total assets of $100  million (as adjusted). ``C'' also has total assets of $100 million (as  adjusted) and is not controlled by Company A. The trust controlled by  Company A plans to acquire 40 percent of the voting securities of  Company C for in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Since Company C is  not included within ``A,'' ``A'' must observe the requirements of the  act before the trust makes the acquisition of Company C's shares.
