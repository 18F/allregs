The sale price shall be indicated on each article by tag or other appropriate means, and a list of articles offered for sale and their respective sale prices shall be posted from time to time in the hospital or station area. In its discretion, the board may offer such articles for purchase by other patients or by charitable organizations before offering them for purchase to the general public. No article shall be sold or resold to any officer or employee of the Service. Moneys received from the sale of articles shall be deposited into the Treasury to the credit of the appropriation from which the materials for making such articles were purchased.</p>
