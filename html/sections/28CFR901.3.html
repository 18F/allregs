                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A state may, based upon exigent circumstances, apply for delayed  submission of fingerprints supporting requests for III records by  agencies authorized to access and receive criminal history records under  Public Law 92-544. Such applications must be sent to the Compact Council  Chairman and include information sufficient to fully describe the  emergency nature of the situation in which delayed submission authority  is being sought, the risk to health and safety of the individuals  involved, and the reasons why the submission of fingerprints  contemporaneously with the search request is not feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In evaluating requests for delayed submissions, the Compact  Council must utilize the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The risk to health and safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emergency nature of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon approval of the application by the Compact Council, the  authorized agency may conduct a III name check pending submission of the  fingerprints. The fingerprints must be submitted within the time frame  specified by the Compact Council. For the purposes of this part, ``time  frame'' means the number of days that elapse between the date on which  the name search was conducted and the date on which the state repository  either positively identifies the fingerprint subject or forwards the  fingerprints to the FBI or the date a Federal agency forwards the  fingerprints to the FBI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Once a specific proposal has been approved by the Compact  Council, another state may apply for delayed fingerprint submission  consistent with the approved proposal, provided that the state has a  related Public Law 92-544 approved state statute, by submitting the  application to the FBI Compact Officer, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Module  C-3, Clarksburg, WV 26306-0001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Part 901 is also applicable to any federal agency authorized to  access   criminal history records pursuant to Federal statute or Executive Order  for noncriminal justice purposes.</p>
