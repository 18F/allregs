                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> USAID may compromise a claim pursuant to this section if USAID  cannot collect the full amount because the debtor does not have the  financial ability to pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable  time, or the debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the Government  does not have the ability to enforce collection in full within a  reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings. In evaluating the  acceptability of the offer, the CFO may consider, among other factors,  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Age and health of the debtor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Present and potential income;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inheritance prospects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly  transferred by the debtor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The availability of assets or income which may be realized by  enforced collection proceedings; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State  and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce  collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> USAID may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a  compromise to DOJ, where there is significant doubt concerning the  Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount of  the claim, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide  dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases  will fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal issues  involved, considering fully the availability of witnesses and other  evidentiary data required to support the Government's claim. In  determining the litigative risks involved, USAID will give proportionate  weight to the likely amount of court costs and attorney fees the  Government may incur if it is unsuccessful in litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> USAID may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a  compromise to DOJ, if the cost of collection does not justify the  enforced collection of the full amount of the debt. The amount accepted  in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the  administrative and litigative costs of collection, taking into  consideration the time it will take to effect collection. Costs of  collection may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small  claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of  large claims. In determining whether the cost of collection justifies  enforced collection of the full amount, USAID may consider the positive  effect that enforced collection of the claim may have on the collection  of other similar claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To assess the merits of a compromise offer, USAID may obtain a  current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of  perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Statutory penalties, forfeitures or debts established as an aid  to enforcement and to compel compliance may be compromised where the CFO  determines that the Agency's enforcement policy, in terms of deterrence  and securing compliance (both present and future), will be adequately  served by accepting the offer.</p>
