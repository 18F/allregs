                            <p class="depth0">Each award by the Program shall contain procedures regarding technical, business, and financial reporting and auditing requirements to ensure that awards are being used in accordance with the Program's objectives and applicable Federal cost principles. The purpose of the technical reporting is to monitor ``best effort'' progress toward overall project goals. The purpose of the business reporting is to monitor project performance against the Program's mission as required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) mandate for program evaluation. The purpose of the financial reporting is to monitor the status of project funds. The audit standards to be applied to TIP awards are the ``Government Auditing Standards'' (GAS) issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and any Program-specific audit guidelines or requirements prescribed in the award terms and conditions. To implement paragraph (f) of Sec. 14.25 of this title, audit standards and award terms may stipulate that ``total Federal and non-Federal funds authorized by the Grants Officer'' means the total Federal and non-Federal funds authorized by the Grants Officer annually.</p>
