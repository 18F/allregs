                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General factors. After considering the bases for a decision to terminate collection action under paragraph (b) of this section, CMS may further consider factors such as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The age and health of the debtor if the debtor is an individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Present and potential income of the debtor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for termination of collection action. Bases on which CMS may terminate collection action on a claim include the following--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inability to collect a substantial amount of the claim. CMS may terminate collection action if it determines that it is unable to collect, or to enforce collection, of a significant amount of the claim. In making this determination, CMS will consider factors such as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Judicial remedies available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The debtor's future financial prospects; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exemptions available to the debtor under State or Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inability to locate debtor. In cases involving missing debtors, CMS may terminate collection action if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is no security remaining to be liquidated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable statute of limitations has run; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The prospects of collecting by offset, whether or not an applicable statute of limitations has run, are considered by CMS to be too remote to justify retention of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost of collection exceeds recovery. CMS may terminate collection action if it determines that the cost of further collection action will exceed the amount recoverable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Legal insufficiency. CMS may terminate collection action if it determines that the claim is legally without merit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evidence unavailable. CMS may terminate collection action if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Efforts to obtain voluntary payment are unsuccessful; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence or witnesses necessary to prove the claim are unavailable.</p>
