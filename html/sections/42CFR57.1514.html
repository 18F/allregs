                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For each application for a loan guarantee or interest subsidy, or combination thereof, which is approved by the Secretary under this subpart, an offer to guarantee such loan and/or make interest subsidy payments with respect thereto will be sent to the applicant, setting forth the pertinent terms and conditions for the loan guarantee and/or interest subsidy, and will be conditioned upon the fulfillment of such terms and conditions. The accepted offer will constitute the loan guarantee agreement, the interest subsidy agreement, or the loan guarantee and interest subsidy agreement, as the case may be. Each such agreement shall include the applicable provisions set forth below:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan guarantee. Each agreement pertaining to a loan guarantee shall include the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the loan guarantee evidenced by the agreement shall be incontestable (i) in the hands of the applicant on whose behalf such loan guarantee is made except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such applicant, and (ii) as to any person who makes or contracts to make a loan to such applicant in reliance on such guarantee, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such other person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the applicant shall be permitted to prepay up to 15 percent of the original principal amount of such loan in any calendar year without additional charge. The applicant and the lender may further agree that the applicant shall be permitted to prepay in excess of 15 percent of the original amount of the loan in any calendar year without additional charge, but no such payment in excess of 15 percent shall be made without the prior written approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That if the applicant shall default in making periodic payment, when due, of the principal and interest on the loan guaranteed under the agreement, the holder of the loan shall promptly give the Secretary written notification of such default. The Secretary shall, immediately upon receipt of such notice, provide the holder with written acknowledgement of such receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That if such default in making periodic payment when due of the principal and interest on the guaranteed loan is not cured within 90 days after receipt by the Secretary of notice of such default, the holder of the loan shall have the right to make demand upon the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe, for payment of 90 percent of the amount of the overdue payments of principal and accrued interest, together with such reasonable late charges as are made in accordance with the terms of the credit instrument or security instrument evidencing or securing such loan. The Secretary shall pay such amount from funds available to him for these purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That in the event of exercise by the holder of the loan of any right to accelerate payment of such loan as a result of the applicants default in making periodic payment when due of the principal and interest on the guaranteed loan, the Secretary shall, upon demand by the holder not less than 90 days after receipt by the Secretary of notification of such default, pay to such holder 90 percent of the total amount of principal and of interest on the loan remaining unpaid after the holder has exercised his right to foreclose upon and dispose of the security and has applied the proceeds thereby received to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan, in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the security instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That the Secretary shall not guarantee any funds which are disbursed by a lender following notification by the Secretary to such lender that the Assurance executed by the Applicant under section 799A of the Act is no longer satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest subsidy. Each agreement pertaining to the payment of interest subsidies with respect to a loan shall include the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the holder of the loan shall have a contractual right to receive from the United States interest subsidy payments in amounts sufficient to reduce by up to 3 percent per annum the net effective interest rate determined by the Secretary to be otherwise payable on such loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That payments of interest subsidies pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be made by the Secretary, in accordance with the terms of the loan with respect to which the interest subsidies are paid, directly to the holder of such loan, or to a trustee or agent designated in writing to the Secretary by such holder, until such time as the Secretary is notified in writing by the holder that such loan has been transferred. Pursuant to such written notification of transfer, the Secretary will make such interest payments directly to the new holder (transferee) of the loan: Provided, however, That it shall be the responsibility of the holder to remit any payments of interest subsidy to the new holder which the Secretary may have made to the holder after such transfer and prior to receipt of such written notice, and the Secretary shall not be liable to any party for amounts remitted to the holder prior to receipt of such written notice and acknowledgment in writing by the Secretary of receipt of such notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the holder of the loan will promptly notify the Secretary of any default or prepayment by the applicant with respect to the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event of any exercise by the holder of the loan of the right to accelerate payment of such loan, whether as a result of default on the part of the applicant or otherwise, the Secretary's obligations with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where, during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, the applicant ceases to use the facility for the purposes for which constructed, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease: Provided, however, That where the applicant is continuing to use the

facility for purposes eligible for support under part B of title VII of the act, the Secretary may make a determination, based upon the health manpower needs of the community served by the facility as well as other relevant factors, to continue to make interest subsidy payments in accord with the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined, after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 45 CFR part 83, that the Assurance executed by the applicant under section 704 (or its predecessor, section 799A) of the Act, is no longer satisfactory, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease: Provided, however, That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he determines that a subsequent Assurance submitted by the applicant is satisfactory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined by the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 45 CFR parts 80 and 81, that the applicant has ceased to comply with the Assurance it has executed under 45 CFR 80.4(d) concerning nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease: Provided, however, That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he subsequently determines that the applicant has come into compliance with the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest subsidies are to be paid, it is determined by the Secretary after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, that the applicant has ceased to comply with such title, and its implementing regulations, the Secretary's obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease: Provided, however, That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy payments if he subsequently determines that the applicant has come into compliance with the requirements of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General. In addition to the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, each agreement, whether pertaining to a loan guarantee or interest subsidy or both, shall contain such other provisions as the Secretary finds necessary in order to protect the financial interests of the United States.
