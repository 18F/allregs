Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges  previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the same  rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For  the purpose of this section, any assessment that was determined at a  date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a person's failure  to submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered to have  been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been  filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based  on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the  Board, whichever is earlier.
