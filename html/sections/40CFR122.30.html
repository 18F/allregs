                                Sec. 122.30  What are the objectives of the storm water regulations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 122.30 through 122.37 are written in a ``readable  regulation'' format that includes both rule requirements and EPA  guidance that is not legally binding. EPA has clearly distinguished its  recommended guidance from the rule requirements by putting the guidance  in a separate paragraph headed by the word ``guidance''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the statutory mandate in section 402(p)(6) of the Clean  Water Act, the purpose of this portion of the storm water program is to  designate additional sources that need to be regulated to protect water  quality and to establish a comprehensive storm water program to regulate  these sources. (Because the storm water program is part of the National  Pollutant Discharge   Elimination System (NPDES) Program, you should also refer to Sec. 122.1  which addresses the broader purpose of the NPDES program.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storm water runoff continues to harm the nation's waters. Runoff  from lands modified by human activities can harm surface water resources  in several ways including by changing natural hydrologic patterns and by  elevating pollutant concentrations and loadings. Storm water runoff may  contain or mobilize high levels of contaminants, such as sediment,  suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, pathogens, toxins, oxygen- demanding substances, and floatables.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EPA strongly encourages partnerships and the watershed approach  as the management framework for efficiently, effectively, and  consistently protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems and protecting  public health.
