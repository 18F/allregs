OTS  will notify your Federal Home Loan Bank of the amount of your  assessment. OTS will debit your account for your assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to you, OTS  will directly debit an account you must maintain at your association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Savings and loan holding companies. You may establish an account  at   an insured depository institution and authorize OTS to debit the account  for your semi-annual assessment. If you do not establish an account and  maintain funds in the account sufficient to pay the semi-annual  assessment when due, OTS may charge you a fee to cover its  administrative costs of collecting and billing your assessment. This fee  is in addition to interest on delinquent assessments charged under Sec.  502.45 of this part. OTS will establish the amount of the administrative  fee and publish the amount of the fee in a Thrift Bulletin.</p>
