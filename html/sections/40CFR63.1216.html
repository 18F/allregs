Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must achieve a DRE of 99.99% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:
DRE = [1 - (Wout / Win)] x 100%
Where:
Win = mass feedrate of one POHC in a waste feedstream; and

Wout = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust</p><p class="depth0">emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec.  261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a DRE of 99.9999% for each POHC that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).

You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Alternative to the particulate matter standard--(1) General.

Semivolatile and low volatile metal operating parameter limits must be established to ensure compliance with the alternative emission limitations described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section pursuant to Sec.  63.1209(n), except that semivolatile metal feedrate limits apply to lead, cadmium, and selenium, combined, and low volatile metal feedrate limits apply to arsenic, beryllium, chromium, antimony, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Elective standards for area sources. Area sources as defined under Sec.  63.2 are subject to the standards for cadmium and lead, the standards for arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, the standards for hydrogen chloride and chlorine, and the standards for particulate matter under this section if they elect under Sec.  266.100(b)(3) of this chapter to comply with those standards in lieu of the standards under 40 CFR 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 to control those pollutants.[70 FR 59565, Oct. 12, 2005]</p>
