                                Sec.  73.642  Subscription TV service.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subscription TV service may be provided by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensees and permittees of commercial and noncommercial TV  stations, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees and permittees of low power TV stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A licensee or permittee of a commercial or noncommercial TV  station or a low power TV station may begin subscription TV service upon  installation of encoding equipment having advance FCC approval. However,  the licensee or permittee of a TV broadcast station (not applicable to  low power TV stations) must send a letter to the FCC in Washington, DC,  that subscription TV service will commence at least 30 days prior to  commencement of such service. In that letter, to be entitled ``Notice of  Commencement of STV Operations,'' the licensee or permittee is to state  that it will comply with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through  (e)(3) and Sec.  73.644(c) of this chapter and identify the make and  type of encoding system to be used. A similar notice must be submitted  if the licensee or permittee commences using another type of encoding  system. (See section 644(h).) A notice must also be submitted to the FCC  in Washington, DC, if encoded subscription TV service is to be  discontinued, at least 30 days prior to such discontinuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c))</em> need not be submitted to the FCC, however, the  measurement data must be available to the FCC upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The use of the visual vertical blanking interval or an aural  subcarrier for transmitting subscriber decoder control code signals  during periods of normal non-encoded programming may be used only upon  specific FCC authorization. Letter requests to use either the video  blanking intervals or aural subcarriers during periods of non- subscription programming are to be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A licensee or permittee of a commercial or noncommercial TV  broadcast or low power TV station may not transmit a subscription  service if it has a contract, arrangement, or understanding expressed or  implied, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prevents or hinders it from rejecting or refusing any  subscription TV broadcast program that it reasonably believes to be  unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public interests; or  substituting a subscription or conventional program that, in its  opinion, is of greater local or national importance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delegates to any other person the right to schedule the hours of  transmission of subscription programs. However, this rule does not  prevent a licensee or permittee from entering into an agreement or  arrangement whereby it agrees to schedule a specific subscription TV  broadcast program at a specific time or to schedule a specific number of  hours of subscription programs during the broadcast day (or segments  thereof) or weeks; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deprives it of the right of ultimate decision concerning the  maximum amount of any subscription program charge or fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has provisions that do not comply with the following policies of  the FCC:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unless a satifactory signal is unavailable at the location where  service is desired, subscription TV service must be provided to all  persons desiring it within the Grade A contour of the station  broadcasting subscription programs. Geographic or other reasonable  patterns of installation for new subscription services is permitted and,  for good cause, service may be terminated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Charges, terms and conditions of service to subscribers must be  applied uniformly. However, subscribers may be divided into reasonable  classifications approved by the FCC, and the impositions of different  sets of terms and conditions may be applied to subscribers in different  classifications. Further, for good cause, within such classification,  deposits may be required   from some subscribers and not of others; and, also for good cause, if a  subscription system generally uses a credit-type decoder, cash operated  decoders may be installed for some subscribers.
