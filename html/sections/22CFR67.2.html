                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NED is governed by a bipartisan board of Directors of not fewer  than thirteen and not more than twenty-five members reflecting the  diversity of American society. The officers of the corporation are  Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board, who shall be members of the  Board, a President, Secretary and Treasurer, and such other officers as  the Board of Directors may from time to time appoint. Meetings of the  Board of Directors are held at times determined by the Board, but in no  event fewer than four times each year. A current list of members of the  Board of Directors and a schedule of upcoming meetings is available from  NED's office at 1101 15th Street, NW; Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005- 5000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All major policy and funding decisions are made by the Board of  Directors. The primary statement of NED's operating philosophy, general  principles and priorities is contained in the National Endowment for  Democracy's Statement of Principles and Objectives, adopted by the Board  of Directors in December 1984. Copies of this statement as well as other  general information concerning the organization are available from NED  on request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a grantmaking organization, NED does not carry out programs  directly. All grants made by the corporation shall be by a two-thirds  vote of   those voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Board may from time to time adopt, upon a two-thirds  vote of those voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present,  procedures to address emergency funding requests between meetings of the  Board. In addition, ``[a]ny Board member who is an officer or director  of an organization seeking to receive grants from the Corporation must  abstain from consideration of and any vote on such grant'' (Article VI,  Section 6). Copies of the bylaws are available from NED's offices.  [51 FR 40164, Nov. 5, 1986. Redesignated and amended at 64 FR 54541,  Oct. 7, 1999]</p>
