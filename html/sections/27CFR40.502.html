The premises may consist of more than one building, or portions of buildings, which need not be contiguous or located in the same city, town, village, or State. The manufacturer must designate a central location as a repository for the records required under this subpart. The application for the permit filed under Sec. 40.492 must describe the buildings or portions of buildings by street address (number, street, city or equivalent, and State). The permit application must include a diagram, in duplicate, showing the following information, if applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identification of each building by a letter, number, or similar designation if the factory is in more than one building and each building is not identifiable by a separate street address; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The particular floor or floors, or room or rooms, comprising the factory if the factory consists of, or includes, a portion of a building or portions of buildings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permits issued prior to June 21, 2012.
