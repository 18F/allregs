                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Emergency special assessment imposed on June 30, 2009. On June 30, 2009, the FDIC shall impose an emergency special assessment of 20 basis points on each insured depository institution based on the institution's assessment base calculated pursuant to Sec. 327.5 for the second assessment period of 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Emergency special assessments after June 30, 2009. After June 30, 2009, if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to fall to a level that that the Board believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a

level which shall be close to zero or negative at the end of a calendar quarter, an emergency special assessment of up to 10 basis points may be imposed by a vote of the Board on all insured depository institutions based on each institution's assessment base calculated pursuant to Sec. 327.5 for the corresponding assessment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Estimation process. For purposes of any emergency special assessment under this paragraph (b), the FDIC shall estimate the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund for the applicable calendar quarter end from available data on, or estimates of, insurance fund assessment income, investment income, operating expenses, other revenue and expenses, and loss provisions, including provisions for anticipated failures. The FDIC will assume that estimated insured deposits will increase during the quarter at the average quarterly rate over the previous four quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Imposition and announcement of emergency special assessments. Any emergency special assessment under this paragraph (b) shall be on the last day of a calendar quarter and shall be announced by the end of such quarter. As soon as practicable after announcement, the FDIC will have a notice published in the Federal Register of the emergency special assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Invoicing of any emergency special assessments. The FDIC shall advise each insured depository institution of the amount and calculation of any emergency special assessment imposed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. This information shall be provided at the same time as the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the assessment period in which the emergency special assessment was imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment of any emergency special assessment. Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation any emergency special assessment imposed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section in compliance with and subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 327.3, 327.6 and 327.7 of subpart A, and the provisions of subpart B. The payment date for any emergency special assessment shall be the date provided in Sec. 327.3(b)(2) for the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the calendar quarter in which the emergency special assessment was imposed.

Time t is the end of a year within the</p><p class="depth0">multi-year period over which the model was estimated (as</p><p class="depth0">explained below). The dependent variable takes a value of 1 if</p><p class="depth0">a downgrade occurs and 0 if it does not.</p><p class="depth0">The explanatory variables (regressors) in the model are six financial ratios and a weighted average of the ``C,'' ``A,'' ``M,'' ``E'' and ``L'' component ratings. The six financial ratios included in the model are:</p><p class="depth0">Leverage ratio</p><p class="depth0">Loans past due 30-89 days/Gross assets</p><p class="depth0">Nonperforming assets/Gross assets</p><p class="depth0">Net loan charge-offs/Gross assets</p><p class="depth0">Net income before taxes/Risk-weighted assets</p><p class="depth0">Brokered deposits/domestic deposits above the 10 percent threshold, adjusted for the asset growth rate factor</p><p class="depth0">Table A.1 defines these six ratios along with the weighted average of CAMELS component ratings. The adjusted brokered deposit ratio (Bi,T) is calculated by multiplying the ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits above the 10 percent threshold by an asset growth rate factor that ranges from 0 to 1 as shown in Equation 2 below. The asset growth rate factor (Ai,T) is calculated by subtracting 0.4 from the four-year cumulative gross asset growth rate (expressed as a number rather than as a percentage), adjusted for mergers and acquisitions, and multiplying the remainder by 3\1/3\. The factor cannot be less than 0 or greater than 1.</p><p class="depth0">Equation 2[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04MR09.016</p><p class="depth0">The component rating for sensitivity to market risk (the ``S'' rating) is not available for years prior to 1997. As a result, and as described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated using a weighted average of five component ratings excluding the ``S'' component. Delinquency and non-accrual data on government guaranteed loans are not available before 1993 for Call Report filers and before the third quarter of 2005 for TFR filers. As a result, and as also described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated without deducting delinquent or past-due government guaranteed loans from either the loans past due 30-89 days to gross assets ratio or the nonperforming assets to gross assets ratio. Reciprocal deposits are not presently reported in the Call Report or TFR. As a result, and as also described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated without deducting reciprocal deposits from brokered deposits in determining the adjusted brokered deposit ratio.</p><p class="depth0">Table A.1--Definitions of Regressors------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Regressor                           Description------------------------------------------------------------------------Leverage ratio (%)................

Derivation of Uniform Amount and Pricing Multipliers</p><p class="depth0">The uniform amount and pricing multipliers used to compute the annual base assessment rate in basis points, PiT, for any such institution i at a given time T will be determined from the Statistical Model, the minimum and maximum downgrade probability cutoff values, and minimum and maximum initial base assessment rates in Risk Category I as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 4
PiT = [alpha]0 + [alpha]1 *</p><p class="depth0">diT subject to Min <=PiT <=Min + 4
where [alpha]0 and [alpha]1 are a constant term and a scale factor used to convert diT (the estimated downgrade probability for institution i at a given time T from the Statistical Model) to an assessment rate, respectively, and Min is the minimum initial base assessment rate expressed in basis points. (PiT is expressed as an annual rate, but the actual rate applied in any quarter will be PiT/4.) The maximum initial base assessment rate is 4 basis points above the minimum (Min + 4)</p><p class="depth0">Solving equation 4 for minimum and maximum initial base assessment rates simultaneously,

The FDIC may, from time to time, but no more frequently than annually, re-estimate the Statistical Model with updated data and publish a new formula for determining initial base assessment rates--equation 7--based on updated uniform amounts and pricing multipliers. However, the minimum and maximum downgrade probability cutoff values will not change without additional notice-and-comment rulemaking. The period covered by the analysis will be lengthened by one year each year; however, from time to time, the FDIC may drop some earlier years from its analysis.</p><p class="depth0">VI.

In addition, the bank must place a hold on the deposit account that alerts the bank's employees to an attempted withdrawal. If the cash collateral is held at another bank or at multiple banks, a security agreement must be in place and each bank must have an account control agreement in place.\6\ For the exclusion to apply to a revolving line of credit, the cash collateral must be equal to or greater than the amount of the total loan commitment (the aggregate funded and unfunded balance of the loan).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ An account control agreement, for purposes of this Appendix, means a written agreement between the lending bank (the secured party), the borrower, and the bank that holds the deposit account serving as collateral (the depository bank), that the depository bank will comply with instructions originated by the secured party directing disposition of the funds in the deposit account without further consent by the borrower (or any other party).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Asset-Based and Floor Plan Lending Exclusions</p><p class="depth0">The FDIC retains the authority to verify that banks have sound internal controls and administration practices for asset-based and floor plan loans that are excluded from a bank's reported higher-risk C&I; loans and securities totals.

Fully secured is defined as a 100 percent or lower LTV ratio after applying the appropriate discounts (determined by the loan agreement) to the collateral. If an over advance (including a seasonal over advance) causes the LTV to exceed 100 percent, the loan may not be excluded from higher-risk C&I; loans owed by a higher-risk C&I; borrower. Additionally, the bank must have the ability to withhold funding of a draw or advance if the loan amount exceeds the amount allowed by the collateral formula.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ An asset is self-liquidating if, in the event the borrower defaults, the asset can be easily liquidated and the proceeds of the sale of the assets would be used to pay down the loan.

This loan agreement must establish a maximum percentage advance, which cannot exceed 85 percent, against eligible accounts receivable, include a maximum dollar amount due from any one account debtor, address the financial strength of debtor accounts, and define eligible receivables. The definition of eligible receivables must consider the receivable quality, the turnover and dilution rates of receivables pledged, the aging of accounts receivable, the concentrations of debtor accounts, and the performance of the receivables related to their terms of sale.</p><p class="depth0">Concentration of debtor accounts is the percentage value of receivables associated with one or a few customers relative to the total value of receivables. Turnover of receivables is the velocity at which receivables are collected. The dilution rate is the uncollectible accounts receivable as a percentage of sales.</p><p class="depth0">Ineligibles must be established for any debtor account where there is concern that the debtor may not pay according to terms. Monthly accounts receivable agings must be received in sufficient detail to allow the bank to compute the required ineligibles.

When an appraisal is obtained, or there is a readily determinable market price for the inventory, however, up to 85 percent of the net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) or the market price of the inventory may be financed. Inventory must be valued or appraised by an independent third-party appraiser using NOLV, fair value, or forced sale value (versus a ``going concern'' value), whichever is appropriate, to arrive at a net realizable value. Appraisals are to be prepared in accordance with industry standards, unless there is a readily available and determinable market price for the inventory (e.g., in the case of various commodities), from a recognized exchange or third-party industry source, and a readily available market (e.g., for aluminum, crude oil, steel, and other traded commodities); in that case, inventory may be valued using current market value. When relying upon current market value rather than an independent appraisal, the reporting bank's management must update the value of inventory as market prices for the product change. Valuation updates must be as frequent as needed to ensure compliance with margin requirements. In addition, appropriate mark-to-market reserves must be established to protect against excessive inventory price fluctuations. An asset has a readily identifiable and publicly available

market price if the asset's price is quoted routinely in a widely disseminated publication that is readily available to the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A bank's lending policy or procedures must address the maintenance of an inventory loan agreement with the borrower. This loan agreement must establish a maximum percentage advance rate against acceptable inventory, address acceptable appraisal and valuation requirements, and define acceptable and ineligible inventory. Ineligibles must be established for inventory that exhibit characteristics that make it difficult to achieve a realizable value or to obtain possession of the inventory. Monthly inventory agings must be received in sufficient detail to allow the bank to compute the required ineligibles. At a minimum, ineligible inventory must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Slow moving, obsolete inventory and items turning materially slower than industry average;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inventory with value to the client only, which is generally work in process, but may include raw materials used solely in the client's manufacturing process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consigned inventory or other inventory where a perfected security interest cannot be obtained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Off-premise inventory subject to a mechanic's or other lien; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Specialized, high technology or other inventory subject to rapid obsolescence or valuation problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The bank must maintain documentation of borrowing base certificate reviews and collateral trend analyses to demonstrate that collateral values are actively, routinely and consistently monitored. A borrowing base certificate is a form prepared by the borrower that reflects the current status of the collateral. A new borrowing base certificate must be obtained within 30 days before or after each draw or advance on a loan. A bank is required to validate the borrowing base through asset-based tracking reports. The borrowing base validation process must include the bank requesting from the borrower a list of accounts receivable by creditor and a list of individual items of inventory and the bank certifying that the outstanding balance of the loan remains within the collateral formula prescribed by the loan agreement. Any discrepancies between the list of accounts receivable and inventory and the borrowing base certificate must be reconciled with the borrower. Periodic, but no less than annual, field examinations (audits) must also be performed by individuals who are independent of the credit origination or administration process. There must be a process in place to ensure that the bank is correcting audit exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">Floor Plan Lending Conditions</p><p class="depth0">Floor plan loans may include, but are not limited to, loans to finance the purchase of various vehicles or equipment including automobiles, boat or marine equipment, recreational vehicles (RV), motorized watersports vehicles such as jet skis, or motorized lawn and garden equipment such as tractor lawnmowers. Floor plan loans that meet all the following conditions are excluded from a bank's higher-risk C&I; loan totals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The loan is managed by a loan officer or a group of loan officers at the reporting bank who are experienced in floor plan lending and monitoring collateral to ensure the borrower remains in compliance with floor plan limits and repayment requirements. Loan officers must have experience in reviewing certain items, including but not limited to: Collateral reports, floor plan limits, floor plan aging reports, vehicle inventory audits or inspections, and LTV ratios. The bank must obtain and review financial statements of the borrower (e.g., tax returns, company-prepared financial statements, or dealer statements) on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that adequate controls are in place. (A ``dealer statement'' is the standard format financial statement issued by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and used by nationally recognized automobile dealer floor plan lenders.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For automobile floor plans, each loan advance must be made against a specific automobile under a borrowing base certificate held as collateral at no more than 100 percent of (i) dealer invoice plus freight charges (for new vehicles) or (ii) the cost of a used automobile at auction or the wholesale value using the prevailing market guide (e.g., NADA, Black Book, Blue Book). The advance rate of 100 percent of dealer invoice plus freight charges on new automobiles, and the advance rate of the cost of a used automobile at auction or the wholesale value, may only be used where there is a manufacturer repurchase agreement or an aggressive curtailment program in place that is tracked by the bank over time and subject to strong controls. Otherwise, permissible advance rates must be lower than 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Advance rates on vehicles other than automobiles must conform to industry standards for advance rates on such inventory, but may never exceed 100 percent of dealer invoice plus freight charges on new vehicles or 100 percent of the cost of a used vehicle at auction or its wholesale value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each loan is self-liquidating (i.e., if the borrower defaulted on the loan, the collateral could be easily liquidated and the proceeds of the sale of the collateral would be used to pay down the loan advance).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vehicle inventories and collateral values are closely monitored, including the

completion of regular (at least quarterly) dealership automotive or other vehicle dealer inventory audits or inspections to ensure accurate accounting for all vehicles held as collateral. The lending bank or a third party must prepare inventory audit reports and inspection reports for loans to automotive dealerships, or loans to other vehicle dealers, and the lending bank must review the reports at least quarterly. The reports must list all vehicles held as collateral and verify that the collateral is in the dealer's possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Floor plan aging reports must be reviewed by the bank as frequently as required under the loan agreement, but no less frequently than quarterly. Floor plan aging reports must reflect specific information about each automobile or vehicle being financed (e.g., the make, model, and color of the automobile or other vehicle, and origination date of the loan to finance the automobile or vehicle). Curtailment programs should be instituted where necessary and banks must ensure that curtailment payments are made on stale automotive or other vehicle inventory financed under the floor plan loan.</p><p class="depth0">Detailed Reports</p><p class="depth0">Examples of detailed reports that must be provided to the asset-based and floor plan lending bank include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Borrowing Base Certificates: Borrowing base certificates, along with supporting information, must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The accounts receivable balance (rolled forward from the previous certificate);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sales (reported as gross billings) with detailed adjustments for returns and allowances to allow for proper tracking of dilution and other reductions in collateral;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Detailed inventory information (e.g., raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Detail of loan activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accounts Receivable and Inventory Detail: A listing of accounts receivable and inventory that is included on the borrowing base certificate.

Monthly accounts payable agings must be received to monitor payable performance and anticipated working capital needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Covenant Compliance Certificates: A listing of each loan covenant and the borrower's compliance with each one. Borrowers must submit Covenant Compliance Certificates, generally on a monthly or quarterly basis (depending on the terms of the loan agreement) to monitor compliance with the covenants outlined in the loan agreement. Non-compliance with any covenants must be promptly addressed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dealership Automotive Inventory or Other Vehicle Inventory Audits or Inspections: The bank or a third party must prepare inventory audit reports or inspection reports for loans to automotive dealerships and other vehicle dealerships. The bank must review the reports at least quarterly. The reports must list all vehicles held as collateral and verify that the collateral is in the dealer's possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Floor Plan Aging Reports: Borrowers must submit floor plan aging reports on a monthly or quarterly basis (depending on the terms of the loan agreement).

Higher-Risk Consumer Loans</p><p class="depth0">Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Higher-risk consumer loans are defined as all consumer loans where, as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years (the two-year PD) is greater than 20 percent, excluding those consumer loans that meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan. \8 9\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ For the purposes of this rule, consumer loans consist of all loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties as well as loans and leases made to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures, as defined in the instructions to the Call Report, Schedule RC-C, as the instructions may be amended from time to time. Higher-risk consumer loans include purchased credit-impaired loans that meet the definition of higher-risk consumer loans.</p><p class="depth0">\9\ The FDIC has the flexibility, as part of its risk-based assessment system, to change the 20 percent threshold for identifying higher-risk consumer loans without further notice-and-comment rulemaking as a result of reviewing data for up to the first two reporting periods after the effective date of this rule. Before making any such change, the FDIC will analyze the potential effect of changing the PD threshold on the distribution of higher-risk consumer loans among banks and the resulting effect on assessments collected from the industry. The FDIC will provide banks with at least one quarter advance notice of any such change to the PD threshold through a Financial Institution Letter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Higher-risk consumer loans exclude:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The maximum amounts recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Loans fully secured by cash collateral. To exclude a loan based on cash collateral,

the cash must be in the form of a savings or time deposit held by a bank. The lending bank (or lead or agent bank in the case of a participation or syndication) must, in all cases, (including instances in which cash collateral is held at another bank or banks) have a perfected first priority security interest under applicable state law, a security agreement in place, and all necessary documents executed and measures taken as required to result in such perfection and priority. In addition, the lending bank must place a hold on the deposit account that alerts the bank's employees to an attempted withdrawal. For the exclusion to apply to a revolving line of credit, the cash collateral must be equal to, or greater than, the amount of the total loan commitment (the aggregate funded and unfunded balance of the loan).</p><p class="depth0">Banks must determine the PD of a consumer loan as of the date the loan was originated, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of the date it was refinanced. The two-year PD must be estimated using an approach that conforms to the requirements detailed herein.</p><p class="depth0">Loans Originated or Refinanced Before April 1, 2013, and all Acquired</p><p class="depth0">Loans</p><p class="depth0">For loans originated or refinanced by a bank before April 1, 2013, and all acquired loans regardless of the date of acquisition, if information as of the date the loan was originated or refinanced is not available, then the bank must use the oldest available information to determine the PD. If no information is available, then the bank must obtain recent, refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party to determine the PD. Refreshed data is defined as the most recent data available, and must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the loan. In addition, for loans acquired on or after April 1, 2013, the acquiring bank shall have six months from the date of acquisition to determine the PD.</p><p class="depth0">When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question or in the previous calendar year. If the acquiring bank cannot or does not verify the information provided by the original lender, the acquiring bank must obtain the necessary information from the borrower or other appropriate third party to make its own determination of whether the purchased assets should be classified as a higher-risk consumer loan.</p><p class="depth0">Loans That Meet Both Higher-Risk Consumer Loans and Nontraditional</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Loans Definitions</p><p class="depth0">A loan that meets both the nontraditional mortgage loan and higher-risk consumer loan definitions at the time of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, must be reported only as a nontraditional mortgage loan. If, however, the loan ceases to meet the nontraditional mortgage loan definition but continues to meet the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan, the loan is to be reported as a higher-risk consumer loan.</p><p class="depth0">General Requirements for PD Estimation</p><p class="depth0">Scorable Consumer Loans</p><p class="depth0">Estimates of the two-year PD for a loan must be based on the observed, stress period default rate (defined herein) for loans of a similar product type made to consumers with credit risk comparable to the borrower being evaluated. While a bank may consider additional risk factors beyond the product type and credit score (e.g., geography) in estimating the PD of a loan, it must at a minimum account for these two factors. The credit risk assessment must be determined using third party or internal scores derived using a scoring system that qualifies as empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound as defined in 12 CFR 202.2(p), as it may be amended from time to time, and has been approved by the bank's model risk oversight and governance process and internal audit mechanism. In the case of a consumer loan with a co-signer or co-borrower, the PD may be determined using the most favorable individual credit score.</p><p class="depth0">In estimating the PD based on such scores, banks must adhere to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The PD must be estimated as the average of the two, 24-month default rates observed from July 2007 to June 2009, and July 2009 to June 2011, where the average is calculated according to the following formula and DRt is the observed default rate over the 24-month period beginning in July of year t:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31OC12.028</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The default rate for each 24-month period must be calculated as the number of active loans that experienced at least one default event during the period divided by the total number of active loans as of the observation date (i.e., the beginning of the 24-month period). An ``active'' loan is defined as any loan that was open and not in default as of the observation date, and on which a payment was made within the 12 months prior to the observation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The default rate for each 24-month period must be calculated using a stratified random sample of loans that is sufficient in size to derive statistically meaningful results for the product type and credit score (and any additional risk factors) being evaluated. The product strata must be as homogenous as possible with respect to the factors that influence default, such that products with distinct risk characteristics are evaluated separately. The loans should be sampled based on the credit score as of the observation date, and each 24-month default rate must be calculated using a random sample of at least 1,200 active loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Credit score strata must be determined by partitioning the entire credit score range generated by a given scoring system into a minimum of 15 bands. While the width of the credit score bands may vary, the scores within each band must reflect a comparable level of credit risk. Because performance data for scores at the upper and lower extremes of the population distribution is likely to be limited, however, the top and bottom bands may include a range of scores that suggest some variance in credit quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Each credit score will need to have a unique PD associated with it. Therefore, when the number of score bands is less than the number of unique credit scores (as will almost always be the case), banks must use a linear interpolation between adjacent default rates to determine the PD for a particular score. The observed default rate for each band must be assumed to correspond to the midpoint of the range for the band. For example, if one score band ranges from 621 to 625 and has an observed default rate of 4 percent, while the next lowest band ranges from 616 to 620 and has an observed default rate of 6 percent, a 620 score must be assigned a default rate of 5.2 percent, calculated as[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31OC12.029</p><p class="depth0">When evaluating scores that fall below the midpoint of the lowest score band or above the midpoint of the highest score band, the interpolation must be based on an assumed adjacent default rate of 1 or 0, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The credit scores represented in the historical sample must have been produced by the same entity, using the same or substantially similar methodology as the methodology used to derive the credit scores to which the default rates will be applied. For example, the default rate for a particular vendor score cannot be evaluated based on the score-to-default rate relationship for a different vendor, even if the range of scores under both systems is the same. On the other hand, if the current and historical scores were produced by the same vendor using slightly different versions of the same scoring system and equivalent scores represent a similar likelihood of default, then the historical experience could be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A loan is to be considered in default when it is 90 + days past due, charged-off, or the borrower enters bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0">Unscorable Consumer Loans</p><p class="depth0">For unscorable consumer loans--where the available information about a borrower is insufficient to determine a credit score--the bank will be unable to assign a PD to the loan according to the requirements described above. If the total outstanding balance of the unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type (including, but not limited to, student loans) exceeds 5 percent of the total outstanding balance for that product type, including both foreign and domestic loans, the excess amount shall be treated as higher risk (the de minimis approach). Otherwise, the total outstanding balance of unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type will not be considered higher risk. The consumer product types used to determine whether the 5 percent test is satisfied shall correspond to the product types listed in the table used for reporting PD estimates.</p><p class="depth0">A bank may not develop PD estimates for unscorable loans based on internal data.</p><p class="depth0">If, after the origination or refinance of the loan, an unscorable consumer loan becomes scorable, a bank must reclassify the loan using a PD estimated according to the general requirements above. Based upon that PD, the loan will be determined to be either higher risk or not, and that determination will remain in effect until a refinancing occurs, at which time the loan must be re-evaluated. An unscorable loan must be reviewed at least annually to determine if a credit score has become available.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative Methodologies</p><p class="depth0">A bank may use internally derived default rates that were calculated using fewer observations or score bands than those specified above under certain conditions. The bank must submit a written request to the FDIC either in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under the requested approach. The request must explain in detail how the proposed approach differs from the rule specifications and the bank must provide support for the statistical appropriateness of the proposed methodology. The request must include, at a minimum, a table with the default rates and number of observations used in each score and product segment. The FDIC will evaluate the proposed methodology and may request additional information from the bank, which the bank must provide. The bank may report using its proposed approach while the FDIC evaluates the methodology. If, after reviewing the request, the FDIC determines that the bank's methodology is unacceptable, the bank will be required to amend its Call Reports and report according to the generally applicable specifications for PD estimation. The bank will be required to submit amended information for no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination.</p><p class="depth0">Foreign Consumer Loans</p><p class="depth0">A bank must estimate the PD of a foreign consumer loan according to the general requirements described above unless doing so would be unduly complex or burdensome (e.g., if a bank had to develop separate PD mappings for many different countries).

The FDIC may grant a bank tentative approval to use the methodology while the FDIC considers it in more detail. If the FDIC ultimately disapproves the methodology, the bank may be required to amend its Call Reports; however, the bank will be required to amend no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination. In the amended Call Reports, the bank must treat any loan whose PD had been estimated using the disapproved methodology as an unscorable domestic consumer loan subject to the de minimis approach described above.</p><p class="depth0">Basel II Approach</p><p class="depth0">A bank that is required to calculate PDs for foreign consumer loans under the requirements of the Basel II capital framework may estimate the two-year PD of a foreign consumer loan based on the one-year PD used for Basel II capital purposes.\10\ The bank must submit a written request to the FDIC in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under that methodology. The request must explain in detail how one-year PDs calculated under the Basel II framework are translated to two-year PDs that meet the requirements above. While the range of acceptable approaches is potentially broad, any proposed methodology must meet the following requirements:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ Using these Basel II PDs for this purpose does not imply that a bank's PFR has approved use of these PDs for the Basel II capital framework. If a bank's PFR requires it to revise its Basel II PD methodology, the bank must use revised Basel II PDs to calculate (or recalculate if necessary) corresponding PDs under this Basel II approach.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The bank must use data on a sample of loans for which both the one-year Basel II PDs and two-year final rule PDs can be calculated. The sample may contain both foreign and domestic loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The bank must use the sample data to demonstrate that a meaningful relationship exists between the two types of PD estimates, and the significance and nature of the relationship must be determined using accepted statistical principles and methodologies. For example, to the extent that a linear relationship exists in the sample data, the

bank may use an ordinary least-squares regression to determine the best linear translation of Basel II PDs to final rule PDs. The estimated equation should fit the data reasonably well based on standard statistics such as the coefficient of determination; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The method must account for any significant variation in the relationship between the two types of PD estimates that exists across consumer products based on the empirical analysis of the data. For example, if the bank is using a linear regression to determine the relationship between PD estimates, it should test whether the parameter estimates are significantly different by product type.</p><p class="depth0">The bank may report using this approach (if it first notifies the FDIC of its intention to do so), while the FDIC evaluates the methodology. If, after reviewing the methodology, the FDIC determines that the methodology is unacceptable, the bank will be required to amend its Call Reports. The bank will be required to submit amended information for no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination.</p><p class="depth0">Refinance</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of higher-risk consumer loans, a refinance includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Extending new credit or additional funds on an existing loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Replacing an existing loan with a new or modified obligation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Consolidating multiple existing obligations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disbursing additional funds to the borrower.

A material increase in the amount of a line of credit is defined as a 10 percent or greater increase in the quarter-end line of credit limit; however, a temporary increase in a credit card line of credit is not a material increase;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Increasing or decreasing the interest rate (except as noted herein for credit card loans); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rescheduling principal or interest payments to create or increase a balloon payment or extend the legal maturity date of the loan by more than six months.</p><p class="depth0">A refinance for this purpose does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A re-aging, defined as returning a delinquent, open-end account to current status without collecting the total amount of principal, interest, and fees that are contractually due, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The re-aging is part of a program that, at a minimum, adheres to the re-aging guidelines recommended in the interagency approved Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy;\11\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ Among other things, for a loan to be considered for re-aging, the following must be true: (1) The borrower must have demonstrated a renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan; (2) the loan must have existed for at least nine months; and (3) the borrower must have made at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent cumulative amount.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The program has clearly defined policy guidelines and parameters for re-aging, as well as internal methods of ensuring the reasonableness of those guidelines and monitoring their effectiveness; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The bank monitors both the number and dollar amount of re-aged accounts, collects and analyzes data to assess the performance of re-aged accounts, and determines the effect of re-aging practices on past due ratios;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Modifications to a loan that would otherwise meet this definition of refinance, but result in the classification of a loan as a TDR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any modification made to a consumer loan pursuant to a government program, such as the Home Affordable Modification Program or the Home Affordable Refinance Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Deferrals under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A contractual deferral of payments or change in interest rate that is consistent with the terms of the original loan agreement (e.g., as allowed in some student loans);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided above, a modification or series of modifications to a closed-end consumer loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> An advance of funds, an increase in the line of credit, or a change in the interest rate that is consistent with the terms of the loan agreement for an open-end or revolving line of credit (e.g., credit cards or home equity lines of credit);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For credit card loans:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Replacing an existing card because the original is expiring, for security reasons, or because of a new technology or a new system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reissuing a credit card that has been temporarily suspended (as opposed to closed);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Temporarily increasing the line of credit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Providing access to additional credit when a bank has internally approved a higher credit line than it has made available to the customer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Changing the interest rate of a credit card line when mandated by law (such as in the case of the Credit CARD Act).</p><p class="depth0">4. Nontraditional mortgage loans</p><p class="depth0">Nontraditional mortgage loans include all residential loan products that allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal or interest and include all interest-only products, teaser rate mortgages, and negative amortizing mortgages, with the exception of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or reverse mortgages. A teaser-rate mortgage loan is defined as a mortgage with a discounted initial rate where the lender offers a lower rate and lower payments for part of the mortgage term. A mortgage loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the teaser rate has expired. An interest-only loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the loan begins to amortize.</p><p class="depth0">Banks must determine whether residential loans meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, as refinance is defined in this Appendix for purposes of higher-risk consumer loans. When a bank acquires a residential loan, it must determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender. If this information is unavailable, the bank must obtain refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party. Refreshed data for residential loans is defined as the most recent data available. The data, however, must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the residential loan. The acquiring bank must also determine whether an acquired loan is higher risk not later than three months after acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, however, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year or the previous calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question.</p><p class="depth0">5. Higher-Risk Securitizations</p><p class="depth0">Higher-risk securitizations are defined as securitizations or securitization exposures (except securitizations classified as trading book), where, in aggregate, more than 50 percent of the assets backing the securitization meet either the criteria for higher-risk C & I loans or securities, higher-risk consumer loans, or nontraditional mortgage loans, except those classified as trading book. A securitization is as defined in 12 CFR part 325, Appendix A, Section II(B)(16), or in 12 CFR 324.2, as applicable, as they may be amended from time to time. A higher-risk securitization excludes the maximum amount that is recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions.</p><p class="depth0">A bank must determine whether a securitization is higher risk based upon information as of the date of issuance (i.e., the date the securitization is sold on a market to the public for the first time). The bank must make this determination within the time limit that would apply under this Appendix if the bank were directly acquiring loans or securities of the type underlying the securitization. In making the determination, a bank must use one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For a securitization collateralized by a static pool of loans, whose underlying collateral changes due to the sale or amortization of these loans, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, owned by the securitization on the date of issuance of the securitization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For a securitization collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans, whose underlying collateral may change by the purchase of additional assets, including purchases made during a ramp-up period, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the highest amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, allowable under the portfolio guidelines of the securitization.</p><p class="depth0">A bank is not required to evaluate a securitization on a continuous basis when the securitization is collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans; rather, the bank is only required to evaluate the securitization once.</p><p class="depth0">A bank is required to use the information that is reasonably available to a sophisticated investor in reasonably determining whether a securitization meets the 50 percent threshold. Information reasonably available to a sophisticated investor includes, but is not limited to, offering memoranda, indentures, trustee reports, and requests for information from servicers, collateral managers, issuers, trustees, or similar third parties. When determining whether a revolving trust or similar securitization meets the threshold, a bank may use established criteria, model portfolios, or limitations published in the offering memorandum, indenture, trustee report, or similar documents.</p><p class="depth0">Sufficient information necessary for a bank to make a definitive determination may not, in every case, be reasonably available to the bank as a sophisticated investor. In such a case, the bank may exercise its judgment in making the determination. In some cases, the bank need not rely upon all of the aforementioned pieces of information to make a higher-risk determination if fewer

documents provide sufficient data to make the determination.</p><p class="depth0">In cases in which a securitization is required to be consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and a bank has access to the necessary information, a bank may opt for an alternative method of evaluating the securitization to determine whether it is higher risk. The bank may evaluate individual loans in the securitization on a loan-by-loan basis and only report as higher risk those loans that meet the definition of a higher-risk asset; any loan within the securitization that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk asset need not be reported as such. When making this evaluation, the bank must follow the provisions of section I.B herein. Once a bank evaluates a securitization for higher-risk asset designation using this alternative evaluation method, it must continue to evaluate all securitizations that it has consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and for which it has the required information, using the alternative evaluation method. For securitizations for which the bank does not have access to information on a loan-by-loan basis, the bank must determine whether the securitization meets the 50 percent threshold in the manner previously described for other securitizations.</p><p class="depth0">B.

A bank may opt to apply the definition of higher-risk C&I; loans and securities in this Appendix to all of its C&I; loans and securities, but, if it does so, it must also apply the definition of a higher-risk C&I; borrower in this Appendix without regard to when the loan is originally made or refinanced (i.e., whether made or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).</p><p class="depth0">For consumer loans (other than securitizations of consumer loans) originated or purchased prior to April 1, 2013, a bank must determine whether the loan met the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan no later than June 30, 2013.</p><p class="depth0">For all securitizations issued before April 1, 2013, banks must either (1) continue to use the transition guidance or (2) apply the definitions in this Appendix to all of its securitizations.

Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 327--Description of the Loss</p><p class="depth0">Severity Measure</p><p class="depth0">The loss severity measure applies a standardized set of assumptions to an institution's balance sheet to measure possible losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution's failure. To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other unsecured liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities.\1\ The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage ratio reaches 2 percent.\2\ In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ In most cases, the model would yield reductions in liabilities and assets prior to failure. Exceptions may occur for institutions primarily funded through insured deposits, which the model assumes to grow prior to failure.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Of course, in reality, runoff and capital declines occur more or less simultaneously as an institution approaches failure.
