                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requirement of the exemption is that an employee must commute  each day from his permanent residence to the farm where he is employed.  Thus, the exemption does not apply to a migrant worker who travels to  different areas of the country during the harvesting seasons. This would  be true even though the worker may remain in the area for a considerable  period of time. On the other hand, if a migrant worker actually changes  his place of residence and thereafter commutes daily from his permanent  residence, the exemption applies from the date of the change of  residence if the other tests are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fact that a worker may live on the farm where the operations  are performed would not be a reason for disqualification. For example,  if the other tests for the exemption are met, members of a tractor  driver's family who reside on the farm could be employed in picking  cotton within the terms of the exemption. Such family members would be  considered to be commuting daily from their permanent residence despite  the fact that their residence may be located on the farm at which they  are employed.</p>
