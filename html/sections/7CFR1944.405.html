                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment of salaries of personnel as authorized in the Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment of necessary and reasonable office expenses such as office rental, office utilities, and office equipment rental. The purchase of office equipment is permissible when the grantee determines it to be more economical than renting. As a general rule, these types of expenses would be classified as indirect costs in multiple funded organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Purchase of office supplies such as paper, pens, pencils, and trade magazines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of necessary employee benefit costs including but not limited to items such as Worker's Compensation, employer's share of social security, health benefits, and a reasonable tax deferred pension plan for permanent employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Purchase, lease, or maintenance of power or specialty tools such as a power saw, electric drill, sabre saw, ladders, and scaffolds, which are needed by the participating families. The participating families, however, are expected to provide their own hand tools such as hammers and handsaws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment of liability insurance and special purpose audit costs associated with self-help activities. These would be considered direct costs, even though the grantee's general liability insurance cost and the cost of audits for the organization are generally indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment of reasonable fees for training of grantee personnel including board members. This may include the cost of travel and per diem to attend in or out-of-State training as authorized by the board of directors and, when necessary, for the employee to do the current job. These costs are generally direct costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment of services rendered by a sponsor or other organization after the grant is closed and when it is determined the sponsor can provide the necessary services which will result in an overall reduction in the cost of assistance. Typically, this will be limited to new grantees and an existing grantee for the period of time that its size or activity does not justify a full staff. A full staff is a full or part-time director, project worker, secretary-bookkeeper, and a construction supervisor. This type of cost is generally direct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Payment of certain consulting and legal costs required in the administration of the grant if such service is not available without cost. This does not include legal expenses for claims against the Federal Government. (Legal costs that may be incurred by the organization for the benefit of the participating families may be paid with prior approval of the State Director).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payments of the cost of an accountant to set up an accounting system and perform audits that may be required. Generally, these costs are indirect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Payments of reasonable expenses of board members for attending regular or special board meetings. These costs are indirect.</p>
