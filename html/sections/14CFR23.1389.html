                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The intensities prescribed in this section must be provided by new equipment with each light cover and color filter in place. Intensities must

be determined with the light source operating at a steady value equal to the average luminous output of the source at the normal operating voltage of the airplane. The light distribution and intensity of each position light must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Position lights. The light distribution and intensities of position lights must be expressed in terms of minimum intensities in the horizontal plane, minimum intensities in any vertical plane, and maximum intensities in overlapping beams, within dihedral angles L, R, and A, and must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intensities in the horizontal plane. Each intensity in the horizontal plane (the plane containing the longitudinal axis of the airplane and perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the airplane) must equal or exceed the values in Sec. 23.1391.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intensities in any vertical plane. Each intensity in any vertical plane (the plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane) must equal or exceed the appropriate value in Sec. 23.1393, where I is the minimum intensity prescribed in Sec. 23.1391 for the corresponding angles in the horizontal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals. No intensity in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values in Sec. 23.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used with main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima specified in Sec. Sec. 23.1391 and 23.1393, if the overlap intensities in relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal clarity. When the peak intensity of the left and right position lights is more than 100 candles, the maximum overlap intensities between them may exceed the values in Sec. 23.1395 if the overlap intensity in Area A is not more than 10 percent of peak position light intensity and the overlap intensity in Area B is not more than 2.5 percent of peak position light intensity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rear position light installation. A single rear position light may be installed in a position displaced laterally from the plane of symmetry of an airplane if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The axis of the maximum cone of illumination is parallel to the flight path in level flight; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is no obstruction aft of the light and between planes 70 degrees to the right and left of the axis of maximum illumination.
