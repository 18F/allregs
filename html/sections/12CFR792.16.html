                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In unusual circumstances, the time limits for responding to your  request (or your appeal) may be extended by NCUA. If NCUA extends the  time, it will provide you with written notice setting forth the reasons  for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to  be dispatched. Our notice will not specify a date that would result in  an extension for more   than 10 working days, except as set forth in paragraph (c) of this  section. The unusual circumstances that can delay NCUA's response to  your request are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for, and collect the requested records from  field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the  office processing the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another agency having substantial interest in  the determination of the request or among two or more components of NCUA  having a substantial interest in the subject matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If NCUA sends you an extension notice, it will also advise you  that you can either limit the scope of your request so that it can be  processed within the statutory time limit or agree to an alternative  time frame for processing your request.
