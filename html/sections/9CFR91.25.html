                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. A general space requirement for any individual animal in stalls or crates on ocean vessels shall be six inches more in height, depth, and width than the measurements of the animal concerned. The number of animals in each stall, pen or other container, the cubic inches of air available for each animal, and the ventilation capability of the transporting carrier are other criteria used to determine final space requirements for each animal. Guidelines of space requirements for storage of animals in pens are listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of

this section. Final determination of space needed and manner of loading of animals for export shipment will be made by the inspector or the APHIS veterinarian at the port of embarkation, based upon the size and type of animals presented, weather, destination, route, and means of transportation employed for the export shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Space guidelines:

Containers used aboard containerized ocean vessels measure 8 feet in width outside but vary from 7 feet 3 inches to 7 feet 9 inches in width inside and from 17 feet to 40 feet in length. For such containers the space requirements and minimum pen widths shown in the following charts shall be used whenever the length of the animal exceeds the width of the container. For ready measurement of dairy cattle only, the distance from the withers to the pin bone multiplied by 1.65 gives the approximate total length. Length of other cattle and large animals will require measurement of their total length. Other animals larger than those shown in the following charts shall be stowed subject to the approval of the inspector or the APHIS veterinarian at the port of embarkation. Maximum inside length of container pens shall be 12 feet 9 inches.

The pavement shall have a broom or rough finish. Steel angle bars may be used for footlocks if they are mounted into the flooring in such a way that, at the same time, the bars serve as gutterways. The angle bars shall not be less than 2 inches by 2 inches and \5/16\ inches in thickness, and spaced on 12 inch centers running for and aft on the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Horses and cattle. Flooring shall be laid athwartship and secured by placing ends beneath the under side of foot and rump boards or under a 2x4 strip nailed along these boards. Floors may be either of two types, flush or raised. The flush type shall be constructed of not less than 1 thick lumber laid flat on the deck. The raised type shall be constructed of not less than 2 thick lumber nailed to scantlings of at least 2x3 dimensions laid 2 feet 6 inches apart. If desired, flooring may be laid in portable sections. Flooring will not be required on ships with wooden decks provided footlocks are secured to the decks. Cement or composite material diagonally scored one-half inch deep may be used on iron decks instead of wooden flooring if the footlocks are molded in the same and bolted to the deck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horses and cattle.

Provisions shall be made for drainage of urine and surface water from all parts of the vessel used for carriage of animals including sufficient scuppers. A walkway shall provide easy access to the scuppers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Horses and cattle. In pens for horses or cattle, there shall be four footlocks of 1x4 lumber laid fore and aft with flat side down, and so placed as to provide in-between spaces of 12, 14, 26, and 14 inches, beginning at inside of the footboard. Additional footlocks shall be added at 14 inch intervals in pens having a depth of 9 feet or more. They shall be well secured with nails of a length that will permit 1 inch clinch in 1 inch flooring and 2 inch penetration in 2 inch flooring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horses and cattle.
