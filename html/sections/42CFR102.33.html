                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible survivors may be able to receive a death benefit under this Program if the Secretary determines that an otherwise eligible deceased smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact sustained a covered injury and died as a direct result of the injury.

Annual and lifetime caps may apply to the death benefits provided. The method and amount of death benefits are described in Sec.  102.82. As provided in Sec.  102.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover death benefits paid to requesters from third-party payors. Death benefits may be paid under two different calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The standard calculation, described in Sec.  102.82(c), is based upon the death benefit available under the PSOB Program and is available to all eligible survivors (except for surviving dependents younger than the age of 18 who are not also surviving eligible children). In the event that death benefits were paid under the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased person, no death benefits may be paid under the standard calculation. In addition, death benefits under this standard calculation are secondary to disability benefits under the PSOB Program. Any death benefit paid under the standard calculation will be reduced by the total amount of benefits for lost employment income paid to the smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact during his or her lifetime and to his or her estate after death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The alternative calculation, described in Sec.  102.82(c), is calculated based on the person's employment income at the time of the covered injury. This calculation is only available to surviving dependents who are younger than the age of 18. The legal guardian(s) of such surviving dependents must select the death benefit as calculated under this alternative calculation before it will be paid. The payment of a death benefit as calculated under this alternative calculation is secondary to other benefits received (compensation for loss of employment income, death benefits (including PSOB Program death benefits), disability benefits, or retirement benefits on behalf of the dependent(s) or his or her legal guardian or life insurance benefits on behalf of the dependent(s)).</p>
