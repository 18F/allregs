Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power reactors shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 km) in radius and the ingestion pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power reactor shall be determined in relation to the local emergency response needs and capabilities as they are affected by such conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes, and jurisdictional boundaries. The size of the EPZs also may be determined on a case-by-case basis for gas-cooled reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 MW thermal. The plans for the ingestion pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the food ingestion pathway.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ Emergency planning zones (EPZs) are discussed in NUREG-0396, EPA 520/1-78-016, ``Planning Basis for the Development of State and Local Government Radiological Emergency Response Plans in Support of Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants,'' December 1978.</p><p class="depth2">\5\ If the State and local emergency response plans have been previously provided to the NRC for inclusion in the facility docket, the applicant need only provide the appropriate reference to meet this requirement.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the applicant, other than an applicant for a combined license, proposes to construct or alter a production or utilization facility, the application shall state the earliest and latest dates for completion of the construction or alteration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the proposed activity is the generation and distribution of electric energy under a class 103 license, a list of the names and addresses of such regulatory agencies as may have jurisdiction over the rates and services incident to the proposed activity, and a list of trade and news publications which circulate in the area where the proposed activity will be conducted and which are considered appropriate to give reasonable notice of the application to those municipalities, private utilities, public bodies, and cooperatives, which might have a potential interest in the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the application contains Restricted Data or other defense information, it shall be prepared in such manner that all Restricted Data and other defense information are separated from the unclassified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)(1)</em> For an application for an operating license or combined license for a production or utilization facility, information in the form of a report, as described in Sec. 50.75, indicating how reasonable assurance will be provided that funds will be available to decommission the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an application for an operating license or combined license for a production or utilization facility, information in the form of a report, as described in Sec. 50.75, indicating how reasonable assurance will be provided that funds will be available to decommission the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or before July 26, 1990, each holder of an operating license for a production or utilization facility in effect on July 27, 1990, shall submit information in the form of a report as described in Sec. 50.75 of this part, indicating how reasonable assurance will be provided that funds will be available to decommission the facility.
