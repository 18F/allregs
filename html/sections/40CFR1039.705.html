                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply separately for calculating emission credits for NOX, NOX+NMHC, or PM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each participating family, calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard. Calculate positive emission credits for a family that has an FEL below the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family that has an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the nearest kilogram (kg), using consistent units throughout the following equation:
Emission credits (kg) = (Std - FEL) x (Volume) x (AvgPR) x (UL) x (10-3)
Where:
Std = the emission standard, in grams per kilowatt-hour, that applies</p><p class="depth2">under subpart B of this part for engines not participating in</p><p class="depth2">the ABT program of this subpart (the ``otherwise applicable</p><p class="depth2">standard'').FEL = the family emission limit for the engine family, in grams per</p><p class="depth2">kilowatt-hour.Volume = the number of engines eligible to participate in the averaging,</p><p class="depth2">banking, and trading program within the given engine family</p><p class="depth2">during the model year, as described in paragraph (c) of this</p><p class="depth2">section.AvgPR = the average maximum engine power of all the engine</p><p class="depth2">configurations within an engine family, calculated on a sales-</p><p class="depth2">weighted basis, in kilowatts.UL = the useful life for the given engine family, in hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In your application for certification, base your showing of compliance on projected production volumes for engines whose point of first retail sale is in the United States. As described in Sec.  1039.730, compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined at the end of the model year based on actual production volumes for engines whose point of first retail sale is in the United States. Do not include any of the following engines to calculate emission credits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines exempted under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR part 1068.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exported engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engines not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded under Sec.  1039.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engines in families that include only stationary engines, except for engines in families certified to standards that are identical to standards applicable under this part 1039 to nonroad engines of the same type for the same model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other engines, where we indicate elsewhere in this part 1039 that they are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart.
