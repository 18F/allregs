If the project is funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Federal share shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OSM is authorized to conduct fire control projects on lands owned or controlled by the United States. However, upon application by another Federal agency having jurisdiction for lands owned or controlled by the United States, or a State or Indian tribe having an approved abandoned mine reclamation program and agreements with Federal agencies to conduct such projects on Federal lands within its boundaries, OSM may enter into an agreement with either the other Federal agency or State or Indian tribe to control or extinguish fires in coal formations. There are no cost sharing requirements for this type of project.
