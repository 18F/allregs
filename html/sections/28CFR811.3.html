Lack of notice does not excuse a failure to  register because sex offenders have an independent obligation to  register. Persons who have been convicted or found not guilty by reason  of insanity of a sex offense or who have been determined to be a sexual  psychopath should report to CSOSA in order to ascertain whether they are  required to register.</p>
