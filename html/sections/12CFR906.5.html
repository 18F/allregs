                            <p class="depth0">The Finance Board conducts its Monthly Survey of Rates and Terms on  Conventional One-Family Non-farm Mortgage Loans in the following manner:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial survey. Each month, the Finance Board samples savings  institutions, commercial banks, and mortgage loan companies, and asks  them to report the terms and conditions on all conventional mortgages  (i.e., those not federally insured or guaranteed) used to purchase  single-family homes that each such lender closes during the last five  working days of the month. In most cases, the information is reported  electronically in a format similar to Finance Board Form FHFB 10-91. The  initial weights are based on lender type and lender size. The data also  is weighted so that the pattern of weighted responses matches the actual  pattern of mortgage originations by lender type and by region. The  Finance Board tabulates the data and publishes standard data tables late  in the following month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustable-rate mortgage index. The weighted data, tabulated and  published pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, is used to compile  the Finance Board's adjustable-rate mortgage index, entitled the  ``National Average Contract Mortgage Rate for the Purchase of Previously  Occupied Homes by Combined Lenders.'' This index is the successor to the  index maintained by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board and is used  for determining the movement of the interest rate on renegotiable-rate  mortgages and on some other adjustable-rate mortgages.
