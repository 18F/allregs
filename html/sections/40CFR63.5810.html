                            <p class="depth0">You must use one of the following methods in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to meet the standards for open molding or centrifugal casting operations in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart. You may use any control method that reduces organic HAP emissions, including reducing resin and gel coat organic HAP content, changing to nonatomized mechanical application, using covered curing techniques, and routing part or all of your emissions to an add-on control. You may use different compliance options for the different operations listed in Table 3 or 5

to this subpart. The necessary calculations must be completed within 30 days after the end of each month. You may switch between the compliance options in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. When you change to an option based on a 12-month rolling average, you must base the average on the previous 12 months of data calculated using the compliance option you are changing to, unless you were previously using an option that did not require you to maintain records of resin and gel coat use. In this case, you must immediately begin collecting resin and gel coat use data and demonstrate compliance 12 months after changing options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Demonstrate that an individual resin or gel coat, as applied, meets the applicable emission limit in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart. (1) Calculate your actual organic HAP emissions factor for each different process stream within each operation type. A process stream is defined as each individual combination of resin or gel coat, application technique, and control technique. Process streams within operations types are considered different from each other if any of the following four characteristics vary: the neat resin plus or neat gel coat plus organic HAP content, the gel coat type, the application technique, or the control technique. You must calculate organic HAP emissions factors for each different process stream by using the appropriate equations in Table 1 to this subpart for open molding and for centrifugal casting, or site-specific organic HAP emissions factors discussed in Sec. 63.5796. The emission factor calculation should include any and all emission reduction techniques used including any add-on controls. If you are using vapor suppressants to reduce HAP emissions, you must determine the vapor suppressant effectiveness (VSE) by conducting testing according to the procedures specified in appendix A to subpart WWWW of 40 CFR part 63. If you are using an add-on control device to reduce HAP emissions, you must determine the add-on control factor by conducting capture and control efficiency testing using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.5850. The organic HAP emissions factor calculated from the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, or a site-specific emissions factor, is multiplied by the add-on control factor to calculate the organic HAP emissions factor after control. Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the add-on control factor used in the organic HAP emissions factor equations.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25AU05.013

It is not necessary that all your process streams, considered individually, demonstrate compliance to use this option for some process streams. However, for any individual resin or gel coat you use, if any of the process streams that include that resin or gel coat are to be used in any averaging calculations described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, then all process streams using that individual resin or gel coat must be included in the averaging calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Demonstrate that, on average, you meet the individual organic HAP emissions limits for each combination of operation type and resin application method or gel coat type. Demonstrate that on average you meet the individual organic HAP emissions limits for each unique combination of operation type and resin application method or gel coat type shown in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Group the process streams described in paragraph (a) to this section

by operation type and resin application method or gel coat type listed in Table 3 to this subpart and then calculate a weighted average emission factor based on the amounts of each individual resin or gel coat used for the last 12 months. To do this, sum the product of each individual organic HAP emissions factor calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus usage that corresponds to the individual factors and divide the numerator by the total amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in that operation type as shown in Equation 2 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25AU05.014

If all emissions factors are equal to or less than their corresponding emission limits, then you are in compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Demonstrate compliance with a weighted average emission limit. Demonstrate each month that you meet each weighted average of the organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart that apply to you. When using this option, you must demonstrate compliance with the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all your open molding operations, and then separately demonstrate compliance with the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all your centrifugal casting operations. Open molding operations and centrifugal casting operations may not be averaged with each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each month calculate the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all open molding operations and the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all centrifugal casting operations for your facility for the last 12-month period to determine the organic HAP emissions limit you must meet. To do this, multiply the individual organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart for each open molding (centrifugal casting) operation type by the amount of neat resin plus or neat gel coat plus used in the last 12 months for each open molding (centrifugal casting) operation type, sum these results, and then divide this sum by the total amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in open molding (centrifugal casting) over the last 12 months as shown in Equation 3 of this section.

If each 12-month rolling average organic HAP emissions factor is less than or equal to the corresponding 12-month rolling average organic HAP emissions limit, then you are in compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Meet the organic HAP emissions limit for one application method and use the same resin(s) for all application methods of that resin type. This option is limited to resins of the same type. The resin types for which this option may be used are noncorrosion-resistant, corrosion-resistant and/or high strength, and tooling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For any combination of manual resin application, mechanical resin application, filament application, or centrifugal casting, you may elect to meet the organic HAP emissions limit for any one of these application methods and use the same resin in all of the resin application methods listed in this paragraph (d)(1). Table 7 to this subpart presents the possible combinations based on a facility selecting the application process that results in the highest allowable organic HAP content resin. If the resin organic HAP content is below the applicable value shown in Table 7 to this subpart, the resin is in compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may also use a weighted average organic HAP content for each application method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Calculate the weighted average organic HAP content monthly. Use Equation 2 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except substitute organic HAP content for organic HAP emissions factor. You are in compliance if the weighted average organic HAP content based on the last 12 months of resin use is less than or

equal to the applicable organic HAP contents in Table 7 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You may simultaneously use the averaging provisions in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to demonstrate compliance for any operations and/or resins you do not include in your compliance demonstrations in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. However, any resins for which you claim compliance under the option in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section may not be included in any of the averaging calculations described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You do not have to keep records of resin use for any of the individual resins where you demonstrate compliance under the option in paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless you elect to include that resin in the averaging calculations described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
