Safety 4/4H EVOH/PE laminate, Ansell Edmont Neoprene number 865, and Solvex Nitrile Rubber number 275 gloves have been tested in accordance with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) F739 method and found by EPA to satisfy the consent orders and Sec. 721.63(a)(2)(i) requirements for dermal protection to 100 percent PMN substance. Gloves and other dermal protection may not be used for a time period longer than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of each work shift. For additional dermal protection materials, a company must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval for each type of material tested prior to use of that material as worker dermal protection. However, for the purposes of determining the imperviousness of gloves, up to 1 year after the commencement of commercial manufacture or import, the employer may use the method described in Sec. 721.63(a)(3)(ii), thereafter, they must use the method described in Sec. 721.63(a)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program.
