If this publication does not contain the coordinates for said other community, the coordinates of the main post office thereof shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where no authorized transmitter sites are available for use as reference points in both communities for the pertinent channels, the distance between the two communities listed in the above publication shall be used. If said publication does not contain such distance, the separation between the two communities shall be determined by the distance between the coordinates thereof as set forth in the publication. Where such coordinates are not contained in the publication, the coordinates of the main post offices of said communities shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the distance between the reference point in a community to which a channel is proposed to be assigned and the reference point in another community or communities does not meet the minimum separation requirements of Sec.  73.610, the channel may be assigned to such community upon a showing that a transmitter site is available that would meet the minimum separation requirements of Sec.  73.610 and the minimum field strength requirements of Sec.  73.685. In such cases, where a station is not authorized in the community or communities to which measurements from the proposed channel assignment must be made pursuant to Sec.  73.610 a showing should also be made that the distance between suitable transmitter sites in such other community or communities and the proposed transmitter site for the new channel meet the Commission's minimum spacing and coverage requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Station separations in licensing proceedings shall be determined by the distance between the coordinates of the proposed transmitter site in one community and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The coordinates of an authorized transmitter site for the pertinent channel in the other community; or, where such transmitter site is not available for use as a reference point,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The coordinates of the other community as set forth in the Index to The National Atlas of the United States of America; or if not contained therein,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The coordinates of the main post office of such other community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition, where there are pending applications in other communities which, if granted, would have to be considered in determining station separations, the coordinates of the transmitter sites proposed in such applications must be used to determine whether the requirements with respect to minimum separations between the proposed stations in the respective cities have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In measuring assignment and station separations involving cities listed in the Table in combination, where there is no authorized transmitter site in any of the combination cities on the channel involved, separation measurements shall be made from the reference point which will result in the lowest separation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To calculate the distance between two reference points see paragraph (c), Sec.  73.208. However, distances shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a kilometer.
