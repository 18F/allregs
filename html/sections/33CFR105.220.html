They  must enable the Facility Security Officer (FSO) to identify any related  security deficiencies that need to be addressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A drill or exercise required by this section may be satisfied  with the implementation of security measures required by the FSP as the  result of an increase in the MARSEC Level, provided the facility reports  attainment to the cognizant COTP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drills. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FSO must ensure that at least one security drill  is conducted every 3 months. Security drills may be held in conjunction  with non-security drills, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drills must test individual elements of the FSP, including  response to security threats and incidents. Drills should take into  account the types of operations of the facility, facility personnel  changes, the type of vessel the facility is serving, and other relevant  circumstances. Examples of drills include unauthorized entry to a  restricted area, response to alarms, and notification of law enforcement  authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a vessel is moored at the facility on the date the facility  has planned to conduct any drills, the facility cannot require the  vessel or vessel personnel to be a part of or participate in the  facility's scheduled drill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exercises. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exercises must be conducted at least once each  calendar year, with no more than 18 months between exercises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exercises may be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full scale or live;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tabletop simulation or seminar;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Combined with other appropriate exercises; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A combination of the elements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through  (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exercises may be facility-specific or part of a cooperative  exercise program with applicable facility and vessel security plans or  comprehensive port exercises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each exercise must test communication and notification  procedures, and elements of coordination, resource availability, and  response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exercises are a full test of the security program and must  include substantial and active participation of FSOs, and may include  government authorities and vessels visiting the facility. Requests for  participation of Company and Vessel Security Officers in joint exercises  should consider the security and work implications for the vessel.
