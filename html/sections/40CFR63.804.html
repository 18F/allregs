Any period for which data collection is required and the operation of the CEMS is not otherwise exempt and for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. The owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The owner or operator of an existing or new affected source subject to Sec.  63.802(a)(4) or (b)(4) shall comply with those provisions by using either of the methods presented in Sec.  63.804(h)(1) and (2) if complying with Sec.  63.802(a)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(i) or by using the method presented in Sec.  63.804(h)(3) if complying with Sec.  63.802(a)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate total formaldehyde emissions from all finishing materials and contact adhesives used at the facility using Equation 5 and maintain a value of Ftotal no more than 400 pounds per rolling 12 month period.

An affected source is in violation of the standard whenever a coating or contact adhesive that is not low-formaldehyde, as demonstrated by records or by a sample of the coating or contact adhesive, is used. Use of a noncompliant coating or contact adhesive is a separate violation for each day the noncompliant coating or contact adhesive is used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compliance certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the company that owns or operates the affected source.
