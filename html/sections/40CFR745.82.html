                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart applies to all renovations performed for compensation in target housing and child-occupied facilities, except for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a written determination has been made by an inspector or risk assessor (certified pursuant to either Federal regulations at Sec. 745.226 or a State or Tribal certification program authorized pursuant to Sec. 745.324) that the components affected by the renovation are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 milligrams/per square centimeter (mg/cm\2\) or 0.5% by weight, where the firm performing the renovation has obtained a copy of the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator, using an EPA recognized test kit as defined in Sec. 745.83 and following the kit manufacturer's instructions, has tested each component affected by the renovation and determined that the components are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 mg/cm\2\ or 0.5% by weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair treads and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only one of the individual components, unless the individual components appear to have been repainted or refinished separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator has collected a paint chip sample from each painted component affected by the renovation and a laboratory recognized by EPA pursuant to section 405(b) of TSCA as being capable of performing analyses for lead compounds in paint chip samples has determined that the samples are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 mg/cm\2\ or 0.5% by weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair treads and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only one of the individual components, unless the individual components appear to have been repainted or refinished separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The information distribution requirements in Sec. 745.84 do not apply to emergency renovations, which are renovation activities that were not planned but result from a sudden, unexpected event (such as non-routine failures of equipment) that, if not immediately attended to, presents a safety or public health hazard, or threatens equipment and/or property with significant damage. Interim controls performed in response to an elevated blood lead level in a resident child are also emergency renovations. Emergency renovations other than interim controls are also exempt from the warning sign, containment, waste handling, training, and certification requirements in Sec. Sec. 745.85, 745.89, and 745.90 to the extent necessary to respond to the emergency. Emergency renovations are not exempt from the cleaning requirements of Sec. 745.85(a)(5), which must be performed by certified renovators or individuals trained in accordance with Sec. 745.90(b)(2), the cleaning verification requirements of Sec. 745.85(b), which must be performed by certified renovators, and the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 745.86(b)(6) and (b)(7).
