                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing the petition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General procedures. Within the 90-day  period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which  the alien obtained permanent residence, the alien and the alien's spouse  who filed the original immigrant visa petition or fiance/fiancee  petition through which the alien obtained permanent residence must file  a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with the  Service. The petition shall be filed within this time period regardless  of the amount of physical presence which the alien has accumulated in  the United States. Before Form I-751 may be considered as properly  filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under Sec. 103.7(b)  of this chapter and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(5) of  this section, and it must be properly signed by the alien and the  alien's spouse. If the joint petition cannot be filed due to the  termination of the marriage through annulment, divorce, or the death of  the petitioning spouse, or if the petitioning spouse refuses to join in  the filing of the petition, the conditional permanent resident may apply  for a waiver of the requirement to file the joint petition in accordance  with the provisions of Sec. 216.5 of this part. Upon receipt of a  properly filed Form I-751, the alien's conditional permanent resident  status shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as  the director has adjudicated the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dependent children. Dependent children of a conditional  permanent resident who acquired conditional permanent resident status  concurrently with the parent may be included in the joint petition filed  by the parent and the parent's petitioning spouse. A child shall be  deemed to have acquired conditional residence status concurrently with  the parent if the child's residence was acquired on the same date or  within 90 days thereafter. Children who cannot be included in a joint  petition filed by the parent and parent's petitioning spouse due to the  child's not having acquired conditional resident status concurrently  with the parent, the death of the parent, or other reasons may file a  separate Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Physical presence at time of filing. A petition may be filed  regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United  States. However, if the alien is outside the United States at the time  of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her  spouse and dependent children, to   comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act.  Furthermore, if the documentation submitted in support of the petition  includes affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides  of the marital relationship, the petitioner must arrange for the  affiants to be present at the interview, at no expense to the  government. Once the petition has been properly filed, the alien may  travel outside the United States and return if in possession of  documentation as set forth in Sec. 211.1(b)(1) of this chapter,  provided the alien and the petitioning spouse comply with the interview  requirements described in Sec. 216.4(b). An alien who is not physically  present in the United States during the filing period but subsequently  applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in  accordance with Sec. 235.11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Documentation. Form I-751 shall be accompanied by evidence that  the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the  immigration laws of the United States. Such evidence may include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation showing joint ownership of property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Birth certificates of children born to the marriage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides  of the marital relationship, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not  entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Termination of status for failure to file petition. Failure to  properly file Form I-751 within the 90-day period immediately preceding  the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained lawful  permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic  termination of the alien's permanent residence status and the initiation  of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States. In such  proceedings the burden shall be on the alien to establish that he or she  complied with the requirement to file the joint petition within the  designated period. Form I-751 may be filed after the expiration of the  90-day period only if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the  director, in writing, that there was good cause for the failure to file  Form I-751 within the required time period. If the joint petition is  filed prior to the jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in  removal proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and  approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's permanent  residence status, remove the conditional basis of such status and cancel  any outstanding notice to appear in accordance with Sec. 239.2 of this  chapter. If the joint petition is not filed until after jurisdiction  vests with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate  the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interview--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authority to waive interview. The director of the  regional service center shall review the Form I-751 filed by the alien  and the alien's spouse to determine whether to waive the interview  required by the Act. If satisfied that the marriage was not for the  purpose of evading the immigration laws, the regional service center  director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so  satisfied, then the regional service center director shall forward the  petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the place of  the alien's residence so that an interview of both the alien and the  alien's spouse may be conducted. The director must either waive the  requirement for an interview and adjudicate the petition or arrange for  an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was  properly filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Location of interview. Unless waived, an interview on the Form  I-751 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other officer so  designated by the district director at the district office, files  control office or suboffice having jurisdiction over the residence of  the joint petitioners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Termination of status for failure to appear for interview. If  the conditional resident alien and/or the petitioning spouse fail to  appear for an interview in connection with the joint petition required  by section 216(c) of the Act,   the alien's permanent residence status will be automatically terminated  as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained  permanent residence. The alien shall be provided with written  notification of the termination and the reasons therefor, and a notice  to appear shall be issued placing the alien under removal proceedings.  The alien may seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status  in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to establish  compliance with the interview requirements. If the alien submits a  written request that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview  be waived, and the director determines that there is good cause for  granting the request, the interview may be rescheduled or waived, as  appropriate. If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the  petitioners, the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview  within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjudication of petition. The director shall adjudicate the  petition within 90 days of the date of the interview, unless the  interview is waived in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  In adjudicating the petition the director shall determine whether--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The qualifying marriage was entered into in accordance with the  laws of the place where the marriage took place;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The qualifying marriage has been judicially annulled or  terminated, other than through the death of a spouse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The qualifying marriage was entered into for the purpose of  procuring permanent residence status for the alien; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A fee or other consideration was given (other than a fee or  other consideration to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a  lawful petition) in connection with the filing of the petition through  which the alien obtained conditional permanent residence. If derogatory  information is determined regarding any of these issues, the director  shall offer the petitioners the opportunity to rebut such information.  If the petitioners fail to overcome such derogatory information the  director may deny the joint petition, terminate the alien's permanent  residence, and issue a notice to appear to initiate removal proceedings.  If derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is  determined during the course of the interview, such information shall be  forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no  unresolved derogatory information is determined relating to these  issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the  alien's permanent residence status removed, regardless of any action  taken or contemplated regarding other possible grounds for removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decision--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval. If the director approves the joint  petition he or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the  alien and shall require the alien to report to the appropriate office of  the Service for processing for a new Permanent Resident Card (if  necessary), at which time the alien shall surrender any Permanent  Resident Card previously issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial. If the director denies the joint petition, he or she  shall provide written notice to the alien of the decision and the  reason(s) therefor and shall issue a notice to appear under section 239  of the Act and 8 CFR part 239. The alien's lawful permanent resident  status shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written  decision. The alien shall also be instructed to surrender any Permanent  Resident Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from  the decision of the director; however, the alien may seek review of the  decision in removal proceedings. In such proceedings the burden of proof  shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance of the  evidence, that the facts and information set forth by the petitioners  are not true or that the petition was properly denied.
