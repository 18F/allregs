                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If a licensee or permittee whose renewal application has been denied  or whose license or permit has been revoked desires a hearing, he shall  file a request for a hearing with the Director, Industry Operations. In  the case of the revocation of a license or permit, he may include a  request for a stay of the effective date of the revocation. On receipt  of the request the Director, Industry Operations shall advise the  licensee or permittee whether the stay of the effective date of the  revocation is granted. If the stay of the effective date of the  revocation is granted, the Director, Industry Operations shall refer the  matter to an administrative law judge who shall set a time and place  (see Sec. 555.77) for a hearing and shall serve notice of the hearing  upon the licensee or permittee and the Director, Industry Operations at  least 10 days in advance of the hearing date. If the stay of the  effective date of the revocation is denied, the licensee or permittee  may request an immediate hearing. In this event, the Director, Industry  Operations shall immediately refer the matter to an administrative law  judge who shall set a date and place for a hearing, which date shall be  no later than 10 days from the date the licensee or permittee requested  an immediate hearing. The hearing will be held in accordance with the  applicable provisions of part 71 of this chapter. Within a reasonable  time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as  possible, the administrative law judge shall render his decision. He  shall certify to the complete record of the proceeding before him and  shall immediately forward the complete certified record, together with  two copies of his decision, to the Director, Industry Operations, serve  one copy of his decision on the licensee or permittee or his counsel,  and transmit a copy to the attorney for the Government.
