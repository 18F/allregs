                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains the rules that the Department of Justice follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this subpart should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB Guidelines''). Additionally, the Department's ``FOIA Reference Guide'' and its attachments contain information about the specific procedures particular to the Department with respect to making FOIA requests and descriptions of the types of records maintained by different Department components. This resource is available at http://www.justice.gov/oip/04--3.html. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under subpart D of part 16 as well as under this subpart. As a matter of policy, the Department makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As referenced in this subpart, component means each separate bureau, office, division, commission, service, center, or administration that is designated by the Department as a primary organizational entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department has a decentralized system for processing requests, with each component handling requests for its records.</p>
