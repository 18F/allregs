                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Before issuing a certificate or placement of load line  marks on a vessel, the assigning and issuing authority shall make an  initial or periodic survey of the vessel as required by this subchapter.  A load line survey report shall be made, reflecting information and  facts based on initial surveys, including required and special elements  as may be deemed necessary by the assigning authority or the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial survey. An initial survey shall be made before the  vessel is put in service or the first time the assigning authority is  requested to survey a vessel. The survey shall include a complete  examination of its structure and equipment insofar as required by the  applicable requirements in this subchapter. This survey shall be such as  to ensure that the arrangements, materials, scantlings, and subsequent  placement of load line marks fully comply with applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodical survey. A periodical survey shall be made at  intervals not exceeding five (5) years from an initial or previous  periodic survey. The survey shall be similar to the initial survey  insofar as extent and purpose are concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the load line marks are found to be correct for the condition  the vessel is then in, the assigning and issuing authority shall issue a  new load line certificate, valid for such time as the condition of the  vessel then warrants but in no case for a period of longer than 5 years.  If, after a survey has been passed, a loadline certificate can not be  issued before the current certificate expires, the current certificate  may be extended by an endorsement in accordance with the requirements  contained in Sec. 42.07-45(d). This endorsement of the assigning  authority shall be placed on the back of the certificate, as shown on  the forms in subpart 42.50. However, if there have been alterations  which affect the vessel's freeboards, such extension shall not be  granted. This prohibition is the same as in Article 19(2) of the 1966  Convention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The periodical survey, including certificate extension or  reissue, for a vessel holding an international load line exemption  certificate for more than one voyage, shall be the same as for any other  vessel covered by this section except for load line marks. However,  other conditions specified in the exemption certificate shall be  verified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annual surveys for endorsements. Vessels subject to initial and  periodic surveys shall have annual surveys,   within 3 months either way of the certificate's anniversary date. The  annual surveys shall be made by and prove satisfactory to the assigning  and issuing authority prior to executing the required annual  endorsements on load line certificates or exemption certificates. The  scope shall be as defined in Sec. 42.09-40 and such as to ensure that  the applicable load line marks are found to be correct for the condition  the vessel is then in.
