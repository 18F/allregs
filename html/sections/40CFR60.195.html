Sec. 60.192 and 60.193 as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The emission rate (Ep) of total fluorides from potroom groups shall be computed for each run using the following equation:

The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 8 hours and 6.80 dscm (240 dscf) for potroom groups and at least 4 hours and 3.40 dscm (120 dscf) for anode bake plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The monitoring devices of Sec. 60.194(a) shall be used to determine the daily weight of aluminum and anode produced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aluminum production rate (P) shall be determined by dividing 720 hours into the weight of aluminum tapped from the affected facility during a period of 30 days before and including the final run of a performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aluminum equivalent production rate (Pe) for anodes shall be determined as 2 times the average weight of anode produced during a representative oven cycle divided by the cycle time. An owner or operator may establish a multiplication factor other than 2 by submitting production records of the amount of aluminum produced and the concurrent weight of anodes consumed by the potrooms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
