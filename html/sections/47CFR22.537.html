                            <p class="depth0">The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria  for the channels listed in Sec. 22.531. These criteria permit channel  assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging  receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of  such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the  operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting  assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not  overlap   the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter controlled  by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier has agreed in  writing to accept any interference that may result from operation of the  proposed transmitter; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap  the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter  controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant  agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the  protected co-channel transmitter; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The area and/or population to which service would be provided by  the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed  that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section,  protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a  current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed  pending applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VHF service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the VHF  channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the service  contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:  d = 1.243 x h\0.40\ x p\0.20\  where d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30  must be used as the value for h in the above formula.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than  27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever  is more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service  contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is  routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function  of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate  the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c)  of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station  radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial  at 2.5[deg] intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> VHF interfering contour. For paging stations transmitting on the  VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the  interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:  d = 6.509 x h\0.28\ x p\0.17\  where d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30  must be used as the value for h in the above formula.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than  27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever  is more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering  contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is  routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function  of angle.
