                                Sec. 301.7701-13  Pre-1970 domestic building and loan association.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962,  and before July 12, 1969, the term ``domestic building and loan  association'' means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic  savings and loan association, a Federal savings and loan association,  and any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings  and loan or similar association under Federal or State law which meets  supervisory test (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the  business operations test (described in paragraph (c) of this section),  and each of the various assets tests (described in paragraphs (d), (e),  (f), and (h) of this section). For the definition of the term ``domestic  building and loan association'', for taxable years beginning after July  11, 1969, see Sec. 301.7701-13A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Supervisory test. A domestic building and loan association must  be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section  401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724 (a)) or (2) subject  by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority  having supervision over such associations. An ``insured institution'' is  one the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Business operations test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An association must  utilize its assets so that substantially all of its business consists of  acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans described  in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section. The  requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the  business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the  public and investing in the prescribed   loans includes ancillary or incidental activities which are directly and  primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as  advertising for savings, appraising property on which loans are to be  made by the association, and inspecting the progress of construction in  connection with construction loans. Even though an association meets the  supervisory test in paragraph (b) and all the assets tests described in  paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, it will nevertheless not  qualify as a domestic building and loan association if any substantial  part of its business consists of activities which are not directly and  primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as brokering  mortgage paper, selling insurance, or subdividing real estate. However,  an association will meet the business operations test for a taxable year  if it meets the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this  paragraph (c), relating respectively to acquiring the savings of the  public, and investing in loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquiring the savings of the public. The requirement that  substantially all of an association's business (other than investing in  loans) must consist of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily  will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material  respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or  supervisory authority. In addition, such requirement will be considered  to be met if more than 85 percent of the dollar amount of the total  deposits and withdrawable shares of the association are held during the  taxable year by the general public as opposed to amounts deposited by  family or related business groups or persons who are officers or  directors of the association. The percentage specified in this  subparagraph shall be computed as of the close of the taxable year, or  at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the  amounts of deposits held during the year. Such average shall be  determined by computing the percentage specified either as of the close  of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during  the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly,  quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Investing in loans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The requirement that  substantially all of an association's business (other than acquiring the  savings of the public) must consist of investing in the loans described  in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section  ordinarily will be considered to be met for a taxable year if the  association meets both the gross income test described in subdivision  (ii) of this subparagraph, and the sales activity test described in  subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, if an association does  not meet the requirements of both subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this  subparagraph, it will nevertheless meet the investing in loans  requirement if it is able to demonstrate that substantially all its  business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) consisted of  investing in the prescribed loans. Transactions which are necessitated  by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring  business activities for profit will not be considered a substantial part  of an association's business. Thus, for example, an association would  meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it  failed to meet the gross income test because of receipt of a non- recurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances, or it failed  to meet the sales activity test because of sales made to achieve  necessary liquidity to meet abnormal withdrawals from savings accounts.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, however, the acquisition of loans  in anticipation of their sale to other financial institutions does not  constitute ``investing'' in loans, even though such acquisition and sale  resulted from an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the  association's area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross income test. The gross income test is met if more than 85  percent of the gross income of an association consists of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest or dividends on assets defined in subparagraph (2),  (3), or (4) of paragraph (d) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of  paragraph (d) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Income attributable to the portion of property used in the  association's business as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> of this section which have at some time been held  by the association, or for which firm commitments have been issued,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Gain or loss on the sale of governmental obligations defined in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Income, gain, or loss attributable to foreclosed property (as  defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section), but not including such  income, gain, or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations  thereunder, is not included in gross income.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, gross income shall be computed  without regard to gains or losses on the sale of the portion of property  used in the association's business (described in paragraph (d)(5) of  this section), without regard to gains or losses on the rented portion  of property used as the principal or branch office of the association  (described in such paragraph), and without regard to gains or losses on  the sale of participations and loans (other than governmental  obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Examples of  types of income which would cause an association to fail to meet the  gross income test, if in the aggregate they exceed 15 percent of gross  income, are the excess of gains over losses on sale of real estate  (other than foreclosed property); rental income (other than on  foreclosed property and the portion of property used in the  association's business); premiums, commissions, and fees (other than  commitment fees) on loans which have never been held by the association;  and insurance brokerage fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sales activity test: in general. The sales activity test is  met for a taxable year if the association meets both the sales of whole  loans test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and the  sales of whole loans and participations test described in subdivision  (v) of this subparagraph. For the purposes of this subdivision and  subdivisions (iv), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term loan means loan as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this  section, other than foreclosed property defined in such paragraph and  governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of a loan shall be determined in accordance with the  rules contained in paragraph (l) (1) and (2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The term loans acquired for investment during the taxable year  means the amount of loans outstanding as of the close of the taxable  year, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of loans outstanding as  of the beginning of such year, and increased by the lesser of (1) the  amount of repayments made on loans during the taxable year or (2) an  amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding as of the  beginning of the taxable year. For this purpose, repayments do not  include repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by  the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term sales of participations means sales by an association  of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of the  regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of  participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of  State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The term sales of whole loans means sales of loans other than  sales of participations as defined in subdivision (d) of this  subdivision, but in determining the amount of sales of whole loans, the  following sales shall be disregarded: Sales of loans made to other  financial institutions pursuant to an arrangement whereunder the  association simultaneously enters in a bona fide agreement to repurchase  such loans within a period of 18 months from the time of sale if such  arrangement conforms to the rules and regulations of applicable  supervisory authorities; sales made to the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corporation or to a corporation defined in paragraph (d)(4) of  this section (relating to deposit insurance company securities); and  sales made in the course of liquidation of the association pursuant to  Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sales of whole loans test. The sales of whole loans test is met  for a taxable year if the amount of sales of whole loans during the  taxable year does not exceed the greater of (a) 15 percent of the amount  of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year, or (b) 20  percent of the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of the  taxable year. However, the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation  specified in subdivision (b) of the previous sentence shall be reduced  by the number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth  of a percentage point) which is equal to the sum of the 2 percentages  obtained by dividing, for each of the 2 preceding taxable years, the  amount of sales of whole loans during each such taxable year by the  amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of such taxable year. For  example, if the amounts of sales of whole loans made by a calendar year  association in 1965 and 1966 were 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively,  of loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, the amount of  sales of whole loans allowed under such subdivision (b) for 1967 would  be an amount equal to 13 percent (20 percent minus 7 percentage points)  of loans outstanding at the beginning of 1967. In computing the  reduction to the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in  such subdivision (b), sales of whole loans made before January 1, 1964,  shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sales of whole loans and participations test. The sales of whole  loans and participations test is met if the sum of the amount of sales  of whole loans and the amount of sales of participations during the  taxable year does not exceed 100 percent of the amount of loans acquired  for investment during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Sales activity tests: special rules--(a) Carryover of sales.  The amount specified in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph as the  maximum amount of sales of whole loans shall be increased by the amount  by which 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment by  the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the amount  of sales of whole loans made during such preceding taxable years; and  the amount specified in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph as the  maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations shall be  increased by the amount by which the amount of loans acquired for  investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years  exceeds the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and participations  made during such preceding taxable years. For example, if 15 percent of  the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 and 1966 exceeded  the amount of sales of whole loans during such years by $250,000, the  amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision  (iv)(a) of this subparagraph would be increased by $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of preceding year's base. If the amount of loans acquired  for investment by the association during the preceding taxable year  exceeds such amount for the current taxable year, the 15 percent  limitation provided in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph and the  100 percent limitation provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph  shall be based upon such preceding taxable year's amount. However, the  maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under subdivision  (iv)(a) and the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and  participations permitted under subdivision (v) in any taxable year shall  be reduced by the amount of the increase in such sales allowed for the  preceding taxable year solely by reason of the application of the  provisions of the previous sentence. For example, assuming no carryover  of sales under subdivision (a) of this subdivision, if the amount of  loans acquired for investment by a calendar year association was  $1,000,000 in 1965, under subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph the  association could make sales of whole loans in 1966 of $150,000 (15  percent of $1,000,000) even though the amount of its loans acquired for  investment during 1966 was only $800,000. However, the amount of sales  of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(a) of this  subparagraph would be reduced to the extent that the amount of the sales  of whole loans made by the association during 1966 exceeded $120,000 (15  percent of $800,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples illustrating sales activity test. The provisions of  subdivisions (iii)   through (vi) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following  examples in each of which it is assumed that the association is a  calendar year taxpayer which is operated in all material respects in  conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State  supervisory authorities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Association made sales of whole loans in 1964 and 1965  which were 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of the amounts of  loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, and which were 25  percent and 17 percent, respectively, of the amounts of loans acquired  for investment in each such year. The amount of X's loans outstanding at  the beginning of 1966 was $1 million, and the amount of its loans  acquired for investment for such year was $300,000. The maximum amount  of sales of whole loans which X may make under the percentage of  beginning loans limitation for 1966 is $30,000, which is 3 percent (20  percent reduced by the sum of 10 percent and 7 percent) of $1 million.  The maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under the  percentage of loans acquired for investment limitation for 1966 is  $45,000 (15 percent of $300,000). X may therefore sell whole loans in an  amount up to $45,000 in 1966 and meet the sales of whole loans test. It  is assumed that the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 did  not exceed $300,000, so that the preceding year's base cannot be used to  increase the amount of sales permitted in 1966.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in the previous example, except  that the amount of loans acquired for investment in the preceding year  (1965) was $320,000. Since such amount is greater than the $300,000  amount of loans acquired for investment in 1966, X may base its 15  percent limitation for 1966 on the $320,000 amount and sell whole loans  in an amount up to $48,000 (15 percent of $320,000) and still meet the  sales of whole loans test. However, to the extent that the amount of  sales of whole loans exceeds $45,000 (15 percent of the $300,000 amount  of loans acquired for investment in 1966), the maximum amount of sales  computed under the percentage of loans acquired for investment  limitation (but not the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation) for  1967 must be reduced.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Y Association made no sales of whole loans in 1964 and  1965, and made sales of participations in the 2 years in amounts which,  in the aggregate, were $50,000 less than the amounts of loans acquired  for investment for such years. At the beginning of 1966 the amount of  Y's loans outstanding was $1 million, and the amount of its loans  acquired for investment in such year was $100,000. Although the maximum  amount of sales of whole loans which Y could make under the sales of  whole loans test is $200,000 (20 percent of $1 million), nevertheless,  in order to meet the sales of whole loans and participations test, the  sum of the amounts of sales of whole loans and sales of participations  may not exceed $150,000 (100 percent of the $100,000 amount of loans  acquired for investment in 1966 plus a carryover of sales from the  previous two years of $50,000). It is assumed that the amount of loans  acquired for investment in 1965 did not exceed $100,000, so that the  preceding year's base cannot be used to increase the amount of sales  permitted in 1966.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Reporting requirements. In the case of income tax returns for  taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with  the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for the  taxable year in each of the categories described in subdivision (ii) of  this subparagraph; and, for the taxable year and the two preceding  taxable years, the amount of loans (described in subdivision (iii)(a) of  this subparagraph) outstanding at the beginning of the year and at the  end of the year, the amount of repayments on loans (not including  repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the  association), the amount of sales of whole loans, and the amount of  sales of participations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3)  of this paragraph (c), are applicable to taxable years ending after  October 31, 1964. However, at the option of the taxpayer, for a taxable  year beginning before November 1, 1964, and ending after October 31,  1964, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph  (except the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in  subdivision (iv)(b) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c)) shall  apply only to the part year falling after October 31, 1964, as if such  part year constituted a taxable year. In such case, the following rules  shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the ``loans acquired for investment'' for such  part year shall be equal to the loans acquired for investment during the  entire taxable year within which falls such part year, multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such part year  and the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The increase in sales of whole loans and participations  permitted by subdivision (vi) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c),  (relating to carryover of sales and use of preceding year's base) shall  be the amount of such increase computed under such subdivision,  multiplied by the fraction specified in subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph.  If, treating the part year as a taxable year, the association meets all  the requirements of this paragraph for such part year it will be  considered to have met the business operations test for the entire  taxable year, providing it operated in all material respects in  conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State  supervisory authorities for the entire taxable year. The 20 percent of  beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (iv)(b) of  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), shall be applied only on the  basis of a taxable year and not the part year. For taxable years  beginning after October 16, 1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, an  association will be considered to have met the business operations test  if it operated in all material respects in conformity with applicable  rules and regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> 90 percent of assets test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. At least 90 percent  of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan  association must consist of the assets defined in subparagraphs (2)  through (10) of this paragraph (d). For purposes of this paragraph, it  is immaterial whether the association originated the loans defined in  subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d), or purchased or  otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph  (j) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this  paragraph, and paragraph (k) of this section for the determination of  amount and character of loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cash. The term ``cash'' means cash on hand, and time or demand  deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial  institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Governmental obligations. The term ``governmental obligations''  means obligations of the United States, a State or political subdivision  of a State, and stock or obligations of a corporation which is an  instrumentality of the United States, a State, or political subdivision  of a State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deposit insurance company securities. The term ``deposit  insurance company securities'' means certificates of deposit in, or  obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which  specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share  accounts of member associations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Property used in the association's business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The  term ``property used in the association's business'' means land,  buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests,  leasehold improvements, and other assets used by the association in the  conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and  investing in the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this  paragraph (d). Real property held for the purpose of being used  primarily as the principal or branch office of the association  constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is  reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use  by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such  occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of  the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has  as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more  than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the  principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used  in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or  sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not  constitute property used in the association's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property rented to others. Except as provided in the second  sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, property or a portion  thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute property  used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental value of  the rented portion of a single piece of real property (including  appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office of the  association constitutes less than 50 percent of the   fair rental value of such piece of property, or if such property has an  adjusted basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be  considered used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50  percent or more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and  such property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation  of its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted  basis of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in  the association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the  same ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental  value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the  association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In  the case of all property other than real property used or to be used as  the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental  value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of  the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be  considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion  constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such  property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as  required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Passbook loan. The term ``passbook loan'' means a loan to the  extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in  the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect  to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Home loan. The term ``home loan'' means a loan secured by an  interest in--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Improved residential real property consisting of a structure or  structures containing, in the aggregate, no more than 4 family units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph and such plan is held out and  advertised as such. A loan secured by a cooperative apartment building  containing more than 4 family units does not constitute a home loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Church loan. The term ``church loan'' means a loan secured by an  interest in real property which is used primarily for church purposes,  or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. For the  purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``church purposes'' means the  ministration of sacerdotal functions, the conduct of religious worship  and closely associated activities designed primarily to provide  fellowship among members of the congregation, or the instruction of  religion. Thus, a parish hall would normally qualify as property used  primarily for church purposes, whereas a building used primarily to  furnish education, other than the instruction of religion, would not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Multifamily loan. The term ``multifamily loan'' means a loan,  other than one defined in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph (d),  (relating to a home loan), secured by an interest in improved  residential real property or a construction loan or improvement loan for  such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Nonresidential real property loan. The term ``nonresidential  real property loan'' means a loan, other than one defined in  subparagraph (7), (8), or (9) of this paragraph (d), (relating  respectively to a home loan, church loan, and multifamily loan) secured  by an interest in real property, or a construction loan or improvement  loan for such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> 18 percent of assets test. Not more than 18 percent of the  amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association  may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2)  through (9) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, the sum of the  amounts of the nonresidential real property loans and the assets other  than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 18  percent of total assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> 36 or 41 percent of assets test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 36 percent test. Unless  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, not more than 36  percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and  loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in  subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus,  unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, the sum of the  amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential real property loans, and  assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not  exceed 36 percent of total assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, if  this subparagraph applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans,  nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined  in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 41 percent of total  assets. See section 593(b)(5) and the regulations thereunder for the  effect of application of this subparagraph on the allowable addition to  the reserves for bad debts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Taxable years for which 41 percent of assets test applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  First taxable year. For an association's first taxable year beginning  after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of paragraph (f)  for its first taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Years other than first and second taxable years. For any taxable  year of an association beginning after October 16, 1962, other than its  first and second taxable years beginning after such date, subparagraph  (2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h)  of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(2), and (h)  of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the  requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this  section for the second preceding taxable year.  Thus, in years other than its first and second taxable years beginning  after October 16, 1962, an association may apply the 41 percent of  assets test for 2 consecutive years, but only if it met the 36 percent  test (and all other tests) for the year previous to the 2 consecutive  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (f) and this paragraph may  be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed  that the association at all times meets all the requirements of  paragraphs (b) through (e) and (h) of this section and files its returns  on a calendar year basis.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An association has 41 percent of its assets invested in  assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of  paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963 and 1964. Because  1963 is its first taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, the 41  percent of assets test applies, and the association therefore qualifies  as a domestic building and loan association for 1963. Because 1964 is  its second taxable year beginning after such date and the 41 percent of  assets test applied for its first taxable year, the 41 percent of assets  test applies for 1964 and it therefor qualifies for such year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An association has 36 percent of its assets invested in  assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of  paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1964, and 41 percent as  of the close of 1965, 1966, and 1967. The association qualifies in 1965  because, as a result of having met the 36 percent of assets test for the  immediately preceding taxable year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test  applies to 1965. It qualifies in 1966 because as a result of having met  the 41 percent of assets test in the immediately preceding taxable year  (1965) and the 36 percent of assets test in the second preceding   taxable year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test applies to 1966. The  association would not qualify in 1967, however, because, although it met  the 41 percent of assets test for the immediately preceding taxable year  (1966), it did not meet the 36 percent of assets test in the second  preceding taxable year (1965), and therefore the 41 percent of assets  test does not apply to 1967.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. An association has more than 41 percent of its assets  invested in assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through  (8) of paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963, and 41  percent invested in such assets as of the close of 1964. The association  does not qualify in either year. It does not qualify in 1963 because it  exceeded the 41 percent limitation, and it does not qualify in 1964  because the 41 percent of assets test does not apply to 1964 since the  association did not meet either the 41 percent of assets test or the 36  percent of assets test in the prior year (1963).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> 3 percent of assets test. Not more than 3 percent of the amount  of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may  consist of stock of any corporation, unless such stock is property which  is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The stock which constitutes  property defined in such paragraph (d) is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stock representing a withdrawable account in another financial  institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United  States or of a State or political subdivision thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock which was security for a loan and which, by reason of  having been bid in at foreclosure or otherwise having been reduced to  ownership or possession of the association, is a loan within the  definition of such term in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its  exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50  percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or  branch office of the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Definition of certain terms. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Loan. The term ``loan'' means debt, as the term ``debt'' is used  in section 166 and the regulations thereunder. The term ``loan'' also  includes a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c)) which  is owned by the taxpayer, and any property (referred to in this section  as ``foreclosed property'') which was security for the payment of any  indebtedness and which has been bid in at foreclosure, or otherwise been  reduced to ownership or possession of the association by agreement or  process of law, whether or not such property was acquired subsequent to  December 31, 1962.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Secured. A loan will be considered as ``secured'' only if the  loan is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of  trust, or land contract) which makes the interest of the debtor in the  property described therein specific security for the payment of the  loan, provided that such instrument is of such a nature that, in the  event of default, the interest of the debtor in such property could be  subjected to the satisfaction of the loan with the same priority as a  mortgage or deed of trust in the jurisdiction in which the property is  situated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest. The word ``interest'' means an interest in real  property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property  is situated, constitutes either (i) an interest in fee in such property,  (ii) a leasehold interest in such property extending or renewable  automatically for a period of at least 30 years, or at least 10 years  beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an  interest in such property, (iii) a leasehold interest in property  described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section (relating to certain  home loans) extending for a period of at least 2 years beyond the date  scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such  property or (iv) a leasehold interest in such property held subject to a  redeemable ground rent defined in section 1055(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Real property. The term ``real property'' means any property  which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is  situated, constitutes real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Improved real property. The term ``improved real property''  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Land on which is located any building of a permanent nature  (such as a house, apartment house, office building, hospital, shopping  center,   warehouse, garage, or other similar permanent structure), provided that  the value of such building is substantial in relation to the value of  such land;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any building lot or site which, by reason of installations and  improvements that have been completed in keeping with applicable  governmental requirements and with general practice in the community, is  a building lot or site ready for the construction of any building of a  permanent nature within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Real property which, because of its state of improvement,  produces sufficient income to maintain such real property and retire the  loan in accordance with the terms thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Construction loan. The term ``construction loan'' means a loan,  the proceeds of which are to be disbursed to the borrower (either by the  association or a third party) as construction work progresses on real  property which is security for the loan, which property is, or from the  proceeds of such loan will become, improved real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Improvement loan. The term ``improvement loan'' means a loan  which, by its terms and conditions, requires that the proceeds of the  loan be used for altering, repairing, or improving real property. If  more than 85 percent of the proceeds of a single loan are to be used for  such purposes, the entire loan will qualify. If 85 percent or less of  the proceeds of a loan are to be used for such purposes, an allocation  of its adjusted basis is required. Examples of loans which constitute  improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of painting a house,  adding a new room to a house, remodeling the lobby of an apartment  building, and purchasing and installing storm windows, storm doors, and  awnings. Examples of loans which do not constitute improvement loans are  loans made for the purpose of purchasing draperies, and removable  appliances, such as refrigerators, ranges, and washing machines. It is  not necessary that a loan be secured by the real property which is  altered, repaired, or improved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Residential real property. The term ``residential real  property'' means real property which consists of one or more family  units. A family unit is a building or portion thereof which contains  complete living facilities which are to be used on other than a  transient basis by only one family consisting of one or more persons.  Thus, an apartment which is to be used on other than a transient basis  by one family, which contains complete facilities for living, sleeping,  eating, cooking, and sanitation constitutes a family unit. Hotels,  motels, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming houses,  hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes, and parks and courts for mobile  homes do not normally constitute residential real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em>, is  made, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being  secured:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> First by the portion of property, if any, defined in  subparagraph (6), (7), or (8) of paragraph (d) of this section to the  extent of the loan value thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph  (9) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value  thereof; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph  (10) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value  thereof.  To the extent that the amount of a loan exceeds the amount treated as  being secured by property defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of  paragraph (d) of this section, such loan shall be treated as property  not defined in paragraph (d) of this section. If the loan value of any  one category of property defined in paragraph (d) of this section  exceeds 85 percent of the amount of the loan for which it is security  then the entire loan shall be treated as a loan secured by such  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loans of $40,000 or less. Notwithstanding the provisions of  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in the case of loans amounting to  $40,000 or less as of the time of a determination, made on the security  of property which is a combination of two or more categories or property  defined in subparagraph (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this  section, all such loans for any taxable   year may, at the option of the association, be treated for the purposes  of this section as being secured by the category of property the loan  value of which constitutes the largest percentage of the total loan  value of the property except to the extent that the loan is treated as  property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Home loans of $20,000 or less. Notwithstanding the provisions  of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, if a loan amounting  to $20,000 or less as of the time of a determination, is secured partly  by property of a category described in subparagraph (7) of paragraph (d)  of this section (relating to a home loan), the amount of the loan shall,  for the purposes of this section, be treated as a loan described in such  subparagraph except to the extent that the loan is treated as property  not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment subsequent to time of determination. The amount of a  loan outstanding as of any time subsequent to the time of a  determination shall be treated, for the purposes of this section, as  being secured by each of the categories of property in the same ratio  that the amount which was treated as being secured by each category bore  to the total amount of the loan at the time as of which the  determination was last made with respect to such loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time of determination--(i) In general. The determination of the  amount of a loan which is treated as being secured by each of the  categories of property shall be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As of the time a loan is made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As of the time a loan is increased;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> As of the time any portion of the property which was security  for the loan is released; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> As of any time required by applicable Federal or State  regulatory authorities for reappraisal or reanalysis of such loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. In the case of loans outstanding with respect to  which no event described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph has  occurred in a taxable year beginning on or after October 17, 1962, the  determination of the amounts of such loans which are treated as being  secured by each of the categories of property may be made, at the option  of the association, as of the close of the first taxable year beginning  on or after such date, providing the determinations with respect to all  such loans are made as of such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Loan value. The loan value of property which is security for a  loan is the maximum amount at the time as of which the determination is  made which the association is permitted to lend on such property under  the rules and regulations of applicable Federal and State regulatory  authorities. Such loan value shall not exceed the fair market value of  such property at such time as determined under such rules and  regulations. However, in the case of loans made incidentally with and as  a part of a bona fide salvage operation, the loan value of the security  property shall be considered to be the face amount of the loan where the  loan can be shown by the association to have been made for the primary  purpose of recovering the investment of the association, and where such  salvage operation is in conformity with rules and regulations of  applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples, in each of which it is assumed  that X Savings and Loan Association files its return on a calendar year  basis, illustrate the application of the rules in this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 1963, X makes a single loan of $1 million to M  Corporation which loan is secured by real property which is a  combination of homes, apartments, and stores.

The  loan will be treated under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph as a loan secured by residential real property containing four  or fewer family units to the extent of $23,000, and by nonresidential  property to the extent of $17,000, as of the time the loan is made.  However, if X exercises the option to treat all loans of $40,000 or less  in accordance with subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, this loan would be treated as a home loan to the extent of  the full $40,000 because the loan value of the residential portion is  larger than the loan value of the nonresidential part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Computation of percentages--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The percentages  specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section shall, except as  provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l), be computed by  comparing the amount of the assets described in each paragraph as of the  close of the taxable year with the total amount of assets as of the  close of the taxable year. The amount of the assets in any category and  the total amount of assets shall be determined with reference to their  adjusted basis under Sec. 1.1011-1, or by such other method as is in  accordance with sound accounting principles, provided such method is  used in valuing all the assets in a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of certain assets and reserves. For purposes of this  paragraph (l):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reserves for bad debts established pursuant to section 593, or  corresponding provisions of prior law, and the regulations thereunder  shall not constitute a reduction of total assets, but shall be treated  as a surplus or net worth item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The adjusted basis of a ``loan in process'' does not include  the unadvanced portion of such loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Advances made by the association for taxes, insurance, etc.,  on loans shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan with  respect to which the advances are made (irrespective of whether the  advances are secured by the property securing the loan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Interest receivable included in gross income shall be treated  as being in the same category as the loan or asset with respect to which  it is earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The unamortized portion of premiums paid on mortgage loans  acquired by the association shall be considered part of the acquisition  cost of such loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Prepaid Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation premiums  shall be treated as being governmental obligations defined in paragraph  (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Accounts receivable (other than accrued interest receivable),  and prepaid expenses and deferred charges other than those referred to  in subdivision (v) or (vi) of this subparagraph, shall be disregarded  both as separate categories and in the computation of total assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this  section) shall   be treated as having the same character as the loan for which it was  given as security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alternative method. At the option of the taxpayer, the  percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may  be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the  taxable year.

The  method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable year to all  categories of assets, but the method may be changed from year to year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acquisition of certain assets. For the purpose of the annual  computation of percentages under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  (l)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assets which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable  year of the taxpayer and ending in the next year, are acquired directly  or indirectly through borrowing and then repaid or disposed of within  such period, shall be considered assets other than those defined in  paragraph (d) of this section, unless both the acquisition and  disposition are established to the satisfaction of the district director  to have been for bona fide purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of cash shall not include amounts received directly  or indirectly from another financial institution (other than a Federal  Home Loan Bank or a similar institution organized under State law) to  the extent of the amount of cash which an association has on deposit or  holds as a withdrawable account in such other financial institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reporting requirements.

If the alternative method of  computing percentages under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l) is  selected, such statement shall show such information as of the end of  each month, each quarter, or semiannually and the manner of calculating  the averages. With respect to taxable years beginning after October 16,  1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, taxpayers shall maintain  adequate records to establish to the satisfaction of the district  director that it meets the various assets tests specified in this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example.

For taxable  years beginning before October 17, 1962, the term ``domestic building  and loan association'' means a domestic building and loan association, a  domestic savings and loan association, and a Federal savings and loan  association substantially all the business of which is confined to  making loans to members.  [32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7622, 44 FR 28661, May  16, 1979]    Sec. 301.7701-13A  Post-1969 domestic building and loan association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, the  term ``domestic building and loan association'' means a domestic  building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association,  a Federal savings and loan association, and any other savings  institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar  association under Federal or State law which meets the supervisory test  (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the business operations  test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), and the assets test  (described in paragraph (d) of this section). For the definition of the  term ``domestic building and loan association'' for taxable years  beginning after October 16, 1962, and before July 12, 1969, see Sec.  301.7701-13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Supervisory test. A domestic building and loan association must  be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section  401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724(a)) or (2) subject by  law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having  supervision over such associations. An ``insured institution'' is one  the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Business operations test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An association must  utilize its assets so that its business consists principally of  acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans. The  requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the  business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the  public and investing in loans includes ancillary or incidental  activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition  and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on  which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the  progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even  though an association meets the supervisory test described in paragraph  (b) of this section and the assets test described in paragraph (d) of  this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building  and loan association if it does not   meet the requirements of both paragraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph  (c), relating, respectively, to acquiring the savings of the public and  investing in loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquiring the savings of the public. The requirement that an  association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist  principally of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be  considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in  conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank  Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory  authority. Alternatively, such requirement will be considered to be met  if more than 75 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits,  withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association are held  during the taxable year by the general public, as opposed to amounts  deposited or held by family or related business groups or persons who  are officers or directors of the association. However, the preceding  sentence shall not apply if the dollar amount of other obligations of  the association outstanding during the taxable year exceeds 25 percent  of the dollar amount of the total deposits, withdrawable shares, and  other obligations of the association outstanding during such year. For  purposes of this paragraph, the term ``other obligations'' means notes,  bonds, debentures, or other obligations, or other securities (except  capital stock), issued by an association in conformity with the rules  and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially  equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. The term  ``other obligations'' does not include an advance made by a Federal Home  Loan Bank under the authority of section 10 or 10b of the Federal Home  Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430, 1430b) as amended and supplemented. Both  percentages specified in this paragraph shall be computed either as of  the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, on the  basis of the average of the dollar amounts of the total deposits,  withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association held  during the taxable year. Such averages shall be determined by computing  each percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of  the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and  by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual  percentages obtained. The method selected must be applied uniformly for  the taxable year to both percentages, but the method may be changed from  year to year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Investing in loans--(i) In general. The requirement that an  association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public)  must consist principally of investing in loans will be considered to be  met for a taxable year only if more than 75 percent of the gross income  of the association consists of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest or dividends on assets defined in paragraphs (1), (2),  and (3) of paragraph (e) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest on loans,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Income attributable to the portion of property used in the  association's business, as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> So much of the amount of premiums, discounts, commissions, or  fees (including late charges and penalties) on loans which have at some  time been held by the association, or for which firm commitments have  been issued, as is not in excess of 20 percent of the gross income of  the association,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Income, gain or loss attributable to foreclosed property, as  defined in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, but not including such  income, gain or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations  thereunder, is not included in gross income.  Examples of types of income which would cause an association to fail to  meet the requirements of this paragraph if, in the aggregate, they equal  or exceed 25 percent of gross income, are: The excess of gains over  losses from sales of real property (other than foreclosed property);  rental income (other than on foreclosed property and the portion of  property used in the association's business); premiums, commissions, and  fees (other than commitment fees) on loans which have never   been held by the association; and insurance brokerage fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation of gross income. For purposes of this paragraph,  gross income is computed without regard to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the portion of property  used in the association's business as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the rented portion of  property used as the principal or branch office of the association, as  defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> of  this section, the term ``sales of participations'' means sales by an  association of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of  the regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of  participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of  State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reporting requirement. In the case of income tax returns for  taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, there is required to be  filed with the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for  the taxable year in each of the categories described in paragraph  (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> 60 percent of assets test. At least 60 percent of the amount of  the total assets of a domestic building and loan association must  consist of the assets defined in paragraph (e) of this section. The  percentage specified in this paragraph is computed as of the close of  the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, may be computed on  the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year.  Such average is determined by making the appropriate computation  described in this section either as of the close of each month, as of  the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and  by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual  percentage obtained for each category of assets defined in paragraph (e)  of this section. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the  taxable year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed  from year to year. For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial  whether the association originated the loans defined in paragraphs (4)  through (8) and (10) of paragraph (e) of this section or purchased or  otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph  (f) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this  paragraph and in paragraph (e) of this section, and for the  determination of amount and character of loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assets defined. The assets defined in this paragraph are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash. The term ``cash'' means cash on hand, and time or demand  deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial  institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Governmental obligations. The term ``governmental obligations''  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obligations of the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligations of a State or political subdivision of a State, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stock or obligations of a corporation which is an  instrumentality of the United States, a State, or a political  subdivision of a State,  other than obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross  income under section 103 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deposit insurance company securities. The term ``deposit  insurance company securities'' means certificates of deposit in, or  obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which   specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share  accounts of member associations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Passbook loan. The term ``passbook loan'' means a loan to the  extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in  the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect  to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Residential real property loan. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Church loan. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Urban renewal loan. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Institutional loan. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Foreclosed property. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Educational loan. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Property used in the association's business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  The term ``property used in the association's business'' means land,  buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests,  leasehold improvements, and other assets used by the association in the  conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and  investing in loans. Real property held for the purpose of being used  primarily as the principal or branch office of the association  constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is  reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use  by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such  occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of  the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has  as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more  than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the  principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used  in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or  sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not  constitute property used in the association's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property rented to others. Except as provided in the second  sentence of paragraph (11)(i) of this paragraph (e), property or a  portion thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute  property used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental  value of the rented portion of a single piece of real property  (including appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office  of the association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental  value of such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted  basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered  used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or  more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and such  property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of  its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis  of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in the  association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same  ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental  value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the  association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In  the case of all property other than real property used or to be used as  the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental  value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of  the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be  considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion  constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such  property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as  required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Regular or residual interest in a REMIC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If for  any calendar quarter at least 95 percent of a REMIC's assets (as  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii) or Sec. 1.6049- 7(f)(3) of this chapter) are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through  (e)(11) of this section, then for that calendar quarter all the regular  and residual interests in that REMIC are treated as assets defined in  this paragraph (e). If less than 95 percent of a REMIC's assets are  assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section, the  percentage of each REMIC regular or residual interest treated as an  asset defined in this paragraph (e) is equal to the percentage of the  REMIC's assets that are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through  (e)(11) of this section.   See Sec. Sec. 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.6049-7(f)(3) of this chapter  for information required to be provided to regular and residual interest  holders if the 95 percent test is not met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loans secured by manufactured housing. For purposes of  paragraph (e)(12)(i) of this section, a loan secured by manufactured  housing treated as a single family residence under section 25(e)(10) is  an asset defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rules.
