They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Knowledge of the wastewater. You may use knowledge of the wastewater stream and/or the process to determine the annual average mass flow rate. You

shall use the maximum expected annual average production capacity of the dyeing/finishing operation(s), knowledge of the process, and/or mass balance information to either estimate directly the average wastewater mass flow rate for the compliance period or estimate the total wastewater mass flow for the compliance period and then factor the total mass by the percentage of time in the compliance period the operating scenario is expected to represent. Where you use knowledge to determine the annual average mass flow rate, you shall provide sufficient information to document the mass flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Historical records. You may use historical records to determine the average annual mass flow rate. Derive the highest annual average mass flow rate of wastewater from historical records representing the most recent 5 years of operation, or if the dyeing/finishing operation(s) has(have) been in service for less than 5 years but at least 1 year, from historical records representing the total operating life of the process unit. Where historical records are used to determine the annual average mass flow rate, you shall provide sufficient information to document the mass flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Measurement of mass flow rate. If you elect to measure mass flow rate, you shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Measurements shall be made at the point of determination, or at a location downstream of the point of determination with adjustments for mass flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Where measurement data are used to determine the annual average mass flow rate, you shall provide sufficient information to document the mass flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustment for flow rates determined downstream of the point of determination. You shall make corrections to the average annual mass flow rate of a wastewater stream when it is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where either wastewater streams from outside of the affected dyeing/finishing operation or group of dyeing/finishing operations have been mixed with the affected wastewater stream or one or more wastewater streams have been treated. You shall make corrections for such changes in the annual average mass flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wastewater treatment. You shall document that the wastewater is either discharged to a POTW or onsite secondary wastewater treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determine the mass of organic HAP in the affected wastewater. Determine the total mass of organic HAP, WW, contained in the wastewater streams characterized by the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, using Equation 7 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29MY03.010

The wastewater allowance for this fraction of organic HAP that is not emitted from the affected dyeing/finishing operation(s) may be taken for each compliance period that the operating scenario, as defined in Sec. 63.4371, does not change from conditions during the performance test in a way that could increase the fraction of organic HAP emitted (e.g., an increase in process temperature or decrease in process pressure or a change in the type or mass fraction of organic

HAP entering the dyeing/finishing operation.) The allowance, WW, must be calculated by multiplying the fraction of organic HAP applied in affected processes that is discharged to the wastewater determined from the most recent performance test by the mass of organic HAP in the dyeing and finishing materials applied during the compliance period, A, as calculated in Equation 4A of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If you are determining the fraction of organic HAP applied in your dyeing/finishing affected source that is discharged to the wastewater, to demonstrate compliance with the equivalent emission rate option of Sec. 63.4291(c)(4), then you must determine it according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section. You must include in the determination only wastewater streams generated by dyeing/finishing operations in your affected source. You shall determine the mass of organic HAP from the average organic HAP concentration and mass flow rate of each wastewater stream generated by each dyeing/finishing operation (or group of dyeing/finishing operations discharging to a common wastewater stream) in your affected source. You shall consider the actual or anticipated production over the compliance period and include all wastewater streams generated by the affected dyeing/finishing operation(s) during this period. A performance test of the organic HAP loading to the wastewater shall be conducted for each operating scenario, as defined in Sec. 63.4371, during the compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Procedure to determine average organic HAP concentration. You must determine the average organic HAP concentration of each wastewater stream according to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures to determine mass flow rate. For each operating scenario, as defined in Sec. 63.4371, for which you have determined the organic HAP content of the wastewater stream, you shall determine the annual average mass flow rate of the wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The annual average mass flow rate for the wastewater stream shall be representative of actual or anticipated operation of the dyeing/finishing operation(s) generating the wastewater over the compliance period. You must determine the annual average mass flow rate of each wastewater stream according to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wastewater treatment. You shall document that the wastewater is either discharged to a POTW or onsite secondary wastewater treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determine the mass of organic HAP in the affected wastewater. Determine the total mass of organic HAP, WW, contained in the wastewater streams characterized by the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, using Equation 7 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determine the fraction of organic HAP applied that is discharged to the wastewater. Determine the fraction of organic HAP applied in your dyeing/finishing affected source that is discharged to the wastewater, i.e., divide WW by the mass of organic HAP in the dyeing and finishing materials applied during the compliance period, A, as calculated in Equation 4A of this section. One of the conditions that must be met to demonstrate compliance with the equivalent emission rate option is that the fraction of organic HAP applied in your dyeing/finishing affected source that is discharged to the wastewater must be at least 90 percent.</p>
