                                Sec. 20.2106-1  Estates of nonresidents not citizens; taxable estate;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The taxable estate of a nonresident who was not a citizen of the  United States at the time of his death is determined by adding the value  of that part of his gross estate which, at the time of his death, is  situated in the United States and, in the case of an estate to which  section 2107 (relating to expatriation to avoid tax) applies, any  amounts includible in his gross estate under section 2107(b), and then  subtracting from the sum thereof the total amount of the following  deductions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The deductions allowed in the case of estates of decedents who  were citizens or residents of the United States under sections 2053 and  2054 (see Sec. Sec. 20.2053-1 through 20.2053-9 and Sec. 20.2054-1)  for expenses, indebtedness and taxes, and for losses, to the extent  provided in Sec. 20.2106-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A deduction computed in the same manner as the one allowed under  section 2055 (see Sec. Sec. 20.2055-1 through 20.2055-5) for  charitable, etc., transfers, except--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the deduction is allowed only for transfers to corporations  and associations created or organized in the United States, and to  trustees for use within the United States, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the provisions contained in paragraph (c)(2) of Sec.  20.2055-2 relating to termination of a power to consume are not  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject to the special rules set forth at Sec. 20.2056A-1(c),  the amount which would be deductible with respect to property situated  in the United States at the time of the decedent's death under the  principles of section 2056. Thus, if the surviving spouse of the  decedent is a citizen of the United States at the time of the decedent's  death, a marital deduction is allowed with respect to the estate of the  decedent if all other applicable requirements of section 2056 are  satisfied. If the surviving spouse of the decedent is not a citizen of  the United States at the time of the decedent's death, the provisions of  section 2056, including specifically the provisions of section 2056(d)  and (unless section 2056(d)(4) applies) the provisions of section 2056A  (QDOTs) must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> provides that no deduction is allowed under  paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section unless the executor discloses  in the estate tax return the value of that part of the gross estate not  situated in the United States. See Sec. 20.2105-1. Such part must be  valued as of the date of the decedent's death, or if the alternate  valuation method under section 2032 is   elected, as of the applicable valuation date.
