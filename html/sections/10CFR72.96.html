                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An ISFSI which is owned and operated by DOE must not be located  at any site within which there is a candidate site for a HLW repository.  This limitation shall apply until such time as DOE decides that such  candidate site is no longer a candidate site under consideration for  development as a HLW repository.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An MRS must not be sited in any State in which there is located  any site approved for site characterization for a HLW repository. This  limitation shall apply until such time as DOE decides   that the candidate site is no longer a candidate site under  consideration for development as a repository. This limitation shall  continue to apply to any site selected for construction as a repository.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an MRS is located, or is planned to be located, within 50  miles of the first HLW repository, any Commission decision approving the  first HLW repository application must limit the quantity of spent fuel  or high-level radioactive waste that may be stored. This limitation  shall prohibit the storage of a quantity of spent fuel containing in  excess of 70,000 metric tons of heavy metal, or a quantity of solidified  high-level radioactive waste resulting from the reprocessing of such a  quantity of spent fuel, in both the repository and the MRS until such  time as a second repository is in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA (101 Stat. 1330-232,  42 U.S.C. 10162(b)) may not be constructed in the State of Nevada. The  quantity of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste that may  be stored at an MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA shall be  subject to the limitations in Sec. 72.44(g) of this part instead of the  limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
