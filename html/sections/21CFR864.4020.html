                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Analyte specific reagents (ASR's) are antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reaction with substances in a specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens. ASR's that otherwise fall within this definition are not within the scope of subpart E of this part when they are sold to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In vitro diagnostic manufacturers; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organizations that use the reagents to make tests for purposes other than providing diagnostic information to patients and practitioners, e.g., forensic, academic, research, and other nonclinical laboratories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. (1) Class I (general controls). Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section,

these devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements in part 807, subpart E of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class I (general controls). Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section,

these devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements in part 807, subpart E of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class II (special controls/guidance documents), when the analyte is used in blood banking tests that have been classified as class II devices (e.g., certain cytomegalovirus serological and treponema pallidum nontreponemal test reagents). Guidance Documents:</p><p class="depth3">1. ``Specifications for Immunological Testing for Infectious Disease; Approved Guideline,'' NCCLS Document I/LA18-A, December 1994.</p><p class="depth3">2. ``Assessment of the Clinical Accuracy of Laboratory Tests Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Plots; Tentative Guideline,'' NCCLS Document KGP10-T, December 1993.</p><p class="depth3">3. ``Review Criteria for Assessment of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Direct Detection of Mycobacterium spp,'' FDA, July 6, 1993, and its ``Attachment 1,'' February 28, 1994.</p><p class="depth3">4. ``Draft Review Criteria for Nucleic Acid Amplification-Based In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Direct Detection of Infectious Microorganisms,'' FDA, July 6, 1993.</p><p class="depth3">5.
