                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of evaluating conditions in Sec.  4.114, the term ``substantial weight loss'' means a loss of greater than 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer; and the term ``minor weight loss'' means a weight loss of 10 to 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer. The term ``inability to gain weight'' means that there has been substantial weight loss with inability to regain it despite appropriate therapy. ``Baseline weight'' means the average weight for the two-year-period preceding onset of the disease.
