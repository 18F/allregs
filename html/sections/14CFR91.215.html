This requirement applies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All aircraft. In Class A, Class B, and Class C airspace areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All aircraft.

While in the airspace as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or in all controlled airspace, each person operating an aircraft equipped with an operable ATC transponder maintained in accordance with Sec. 91.413 of this part shall operate the transponder, including Mode C equipment if installed, and shall reply on the appropriate code or as assigned by ATC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ATC authorized deviations. Requests for ATC authorized deviations must be made to the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the concerned airspace within the time periods specified as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For operation of an aircraft with an operating transponder but without operating automatic pressure altitude reporting equipment having a Mode C

capability, the request may be made at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For operation of an aircraft with an inoperative transponder to the airport of ultimate destination, including any intermediate stops, or to proceed to a place where suitable repairs can be made or both, the request may be made at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For operation of an aircraft that is not equipped with a transponder, the request must be made at least one hour before the proposed operation.
