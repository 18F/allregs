                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the CPSIA  provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended  primarily for children 12 and younger may not contain more than 600 ppm  of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or intended primarily  for children 12 and younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On  August 14, 2011, the limit will be further reduced to 100 ppm, unless  the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible to  meet this lower limit. Section 101(b)(2) of the CPSIA further provides  that the lead limits do not apply to component parts of a product that  are not accessible to a child. This section specifies that a component  part is not accessible if it is not physically exposed by reason of a  sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through  reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product including  swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the  aging of the product, as determined by the Commission. Paint, coatings,  or electroplating may not be considered to be a barrier that would  render lead in the substrate to be inaccessible to a child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em> of the CPSIA provides that if the Commission  determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain  electronic devices to comply with the lead limits, the Commission must  issue requirements by regulation to eliminate or minimize the potential  for exposure to and accessibility of lead in such electronic devices and  establish a compliance schedule unless the Commission determines that  full compliance is not technologically feasible within a schedule set by  the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certain accessible lead-containing component parts in children's  electronic devices unable to meet the lead limits set forth in paragraph  (a) of this section due to technological infeasibility are granted the  exemptions that follow in paragraph (d) of this section below, provided  that use of lead is necessary for the proper electronic functioning of  the component part and it is not technologically feasible for the  component part to meet the lead content limits set forth in paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions for lead as used in certain electronic components  parts in children's electronic devices include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lead blended into the glass of cathode ray tubes, electronic  components, and fluorescent tubes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lead used as an alloying element in steel. The maximum amount of  lead shall be less than 0.35% by weight (3,500 ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lead used in the manufacture of aluminum. The maximum amount of  lead shall be less than 0.4% by weight (4,000 ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lead used in copper-based alloys. The maximum amount of lead  shall be less than 4% by weight (40,000 ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Lead used in lead-bronze bearing shells and bushings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Lead used in compliant pin connector systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lead used in optical and filter glass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Lead oxide in plasma display panels (PDP) and surface conduction  electron emitter displays (SED) used in structural elements; notably in  the front and rear glass dielectric layer, the bus electrode, the black  stripe, the address electrode, the barrier ribs, the seal frit and frit  ring, as well as in print pastes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Lead oxide in the glass envelope of Black Light Blue (BLB)  lamps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Components of electronic devices that are removable or  replaceable, such as battery packs and light bulbs that are inaccessible  when the product is assembled in functional form or are otherwise  granted an exemption, are not subject to the lead limits in paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Commission staff is directed to reevaluate and report to the  Commission on the technological feasibility of compliance with the lead  limits in paragraph (a) of this section for children's electronic  devices, including the technological feasibility of making accessible  component parts inaccessible, and the status of the exemptions, no less  than every five years after publication of a final rule in the Federal  Register on children's electronic devices.
