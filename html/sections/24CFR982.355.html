                                Sec. 982.355  Portability: Administration by receiving PHA.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a family moves under portability (in accordance with Sec.  982.353(b)) to an area outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, another PHA  (the ``receiving PHA'') must administer assistance for the family if a  PHA with an HCV program has jurisdiction in the area where the unit is  located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section, a  PHA with jurisdiction in the area where the family wants to lease a unit  must issue a voucher to the family. If there is more than one such PHA,  the initial PHA may choose the receiving PHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Portability procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The receiving PHA does not  redetermine eligibility for a portable family that was already receiving  assistance in the initial PHA's HCV program. However, for a portable  family that was not already receiving assistance in the PHA's HCV  program, the initial PHA must determine whether the family is eligible  for admission to the receiving PHA's HCV program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The initial PHA must advise the family how to contact and  request assistance from the receiving PHA. The initial PHA must promptly  notify the receiving PHA to expect the family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The family must promptly contact the receiving PHA, and comply  with receiving PHA procedures for incoming portable families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The initial PHA must give the receiving PHA the most recent HUD  Form 50058 (Family Report) for the family, and related verification  information. If the receiving PHA opts to conduct a new reexamination,  the receiving PHA may not delay issuing the family a voucher or  otherwise delay approval of a unit unless the recertification is  necessary to determine income eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the portable family requests assistance from the receiving  PHA, the receiving PHA must promptly inform the initial PHA whether the  receiving PHA will bill the initial PHA for assistance on behalf of the  portable family, or will absorb the family into its own program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The receiving PHA must issue a voucher to the family. The term  of the receiving PHA voucher may not expire before the expiration date  of any initial PHA voucher. The receiving PHA must determine whether to  extend the voucher term. The family must submit a request for approval  of the tenancy to the receiving PHA during the term of the receiving PHA  voucher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The receiving PHA must determine the family unit size for the  portable family. The family unit size is determined in accordance with  the subsidy standards of the receiving PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The receiving PHA must promptly notify the initial PHA if the  family has leased an eligible unit under the program, or if the family  fails to submit a request for approval of the tenancy for an eligible  unit within the term of the voucher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To provide tenant-based assistance for portable families, the  receiving PHA must perform all PHA program functions, such as  reexaminations of family income and composition. At any time, either the  initial PHA or the receiving PHA may make a determination to deny or  terminate assistance to the family in accordance with Sec. Sec. 982.552  and 982.553.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> When the family has a right to lease a unit in the receiving  PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures in accordance with Sec.  982.353(b), the receiving PHA must provide assistance for the family.  Receiving PHA procedures and preferences for selection among eligible  applicants do not apply, and the receiving PHA waiting list is not used.  However, the receiving PHA may deny or terminate assistance for family  action or inaction in accordance with Sec. Sec. 982.552 and 982.553.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Absorption by the receiving PHA. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If funding is available  under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program when the  portable family is received, the receiving PHA may absorb the family  into the receiving   PHA's HCV program. After absorption, the family is assisted with funds  available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD may require that the receiving PHA absorb all or a portion  of the portable families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Portability Billing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To cover assistance for a portable  family, the receiving PHA may bill the initial PHA for housing  assistance payments and administrative fees. This paragraph (e)  describes the billing procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for  the full amount of the housing assistance payments made by the receiving  PHA for the portable family. The amount of the housing assistance  payment for a portable family in the receiving PHA program is determined  in the same manner as for other families in the receiving PHA program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for 80  percent of the initial PHA on-going administrative fee for each unit  month that the family receives assistance under the tenant-based  programs from the receiving PHA. If both PHAs agree, the PHAs may  negotiate a different amount of reimbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HUD may reduce the administrative fee to an initial or receiving  PHA if the PHA does not comply with HUD portability requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In administration of portability, the initial PHA and the  receiving PHA must comply with financial procedures required by HUD,  including the use of HUD-required billing forms. The initial and  receiving PHA must comply with billing and payment deadlines under the  financial procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A PHA must manage the PHA's HCV program in a manner that ensures  that the PHA has the financial ability to provide assistance for  families that move out of the PHA program under the portability  procedures that have not been absorbed by the receiving PHA, as well as  for families that remain in the PHA program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When a portable family moves out of the HCV program of a  receiving PHA that has not absorbed the family, the PHA in the new  jurisdiction to which the family moves becomes the receiving PHA, and  the first receiving PHA is no longer required to provide assistance for  the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Portability funding. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD may transfer funds for assistance  to portable families to the receiving PHA from funds available under the  initial PHA ACC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental  units) to the initial PHA for funds transferred to a receiving PHA for  portability purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental  units) to the receiving PHA for absorption of portable families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HUD may require the receiving PHA to absorb portable families.
