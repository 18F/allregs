(See Sec.  23.47.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You may export a native plant under this certificate only when specifically approved for export and listed on the certificate, inventory sheet, or an approved species list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You may export a specimen under a higher-taxon name only if you identified the taxon in your application and we approved it on this certificate.
