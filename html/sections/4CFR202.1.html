                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The official seal of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Board) is described as follows: The American Eagle, right facing, with left wing outstretched and pointing forward with right wing partially shown, is superimposed over a background suggesting the American Flag; upon a blue field, which fills background space above the Eagle's outstretched wing, are thirteen gold, five-pointed stars; the lower half of the background, filling the space beneath the Eagle's outstretched wing, is vertically striped in alternating colors of red and gold. The entire image is circumscribed by a gold boundary with 18 equally spaced ``gear'' teeth; that image is further encircled by a ring bearing the gold-colored words ``RECOVERY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY'' centered at its top, and the word ``BOARD'' is centered at its bottom and separated from the top-centered words by two laurel branches to its left and right.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board also has developed an alternate, monochromatic version of the seal in which the above-described blue field and red-and-gold stripes are replaced by a white field and white-and-gold stripes. A reproduction of the official seal in black and white appears as follows:
