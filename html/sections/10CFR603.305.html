                            <p class="depth0">The contracting officer may use a fixed-support TIA if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The agreement is to support or stimulate RD&D; with outcomes that are well defined, observable, and verifiable;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The resources required to achieve the outcomes can be estimated well enough to ensure the desired level of cost sharing (see example in Sec. 603.560(b)); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agreement does not require a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing. In cases where the agreement does require a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing, a fixed-support TIA is not practicable because the agreement has to specify cost principles or standards for costs that may be charged to the project; require the recipient to track the costs of the project; and provide access for audit to allow verification of the recipient's compliance with the mandatory cost sharing. A fixed-support TIA may not be used if there is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A requirement (e.g., in statute or policy determination) for a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, otherwise elects to include in the TIA a requirement for a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing.</p>
