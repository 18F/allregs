This denial constitutes a final administrative  decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Director, Bureau of Prisons, denies an inmate's  request, the Director shall provide the inmate with a written notice and  statement of reasons for the denial within 20 workdays after receipt of  the referral from the Office of General Counsel. A denial by the  Director constitutes a final administrative decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Because a denial by the General Counsel or Director, Bureau of  Prisons, constitutes a final administrative decision, an inmate may not  appeal the denial through the Administrative Remedy Procedure.
