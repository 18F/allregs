Likewise, the  contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate  (e.g., where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all  performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the  system).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any  terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage,  or injury to third parties.</p>
