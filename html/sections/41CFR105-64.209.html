If so, the system manager will notify you of the  existence of the record and disclose the information,   but only to the extent that the information does not identify a  confidential source. If disclosure of information could reasonably be  expected to identify a confidential source, the record will not be  disclosed to you unless it is possible to delete all such information. A  confidential source is a person or persons who furnished information  during Federal investigations with the understanding that his or her  identity would remain confidential.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 105	64.3_Denial of Access to Records</p>
