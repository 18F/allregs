                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The in vivo bioavailability of a drug product is measured if  the product's rate and extent of absorption, as determined by comparison  of measured parameters, e.g., concentration of the active drug  ingredient in the blood, urinary excretion rates, or pharmacological  effects, do not indicate a significant difference from the reference  material's rate and extent of absorption. For drug products that are not  intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavailability may be  assessed by measurements intended to reflect the rate and extent to  which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the  site of action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statistical techniques used shall be of sufficient sensitivity  to detect differences in rate and extent of absorption that are not  attributable to subject variability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A drug product that differs from the reference material in its  rate of absorption, but not in its extent of absorption, may be  considered to be bioavailable if the difference in the rate of  absorption is intentional, is appropriately reflected in the labeling,  is not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations  on chronic use, and is considered medically insignificant for the drug  product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Two drug products will be considered bioequivalent drug products  if they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives  whose rate and extent of absorption do not show a significant difference  when administered at the same molar dose of the active moiety under  similar experimental conditions, either single dose or multiple dose.  Some pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives may be  equivalent in the extent of their absorption but not in their rate of  absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because such  differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected  in the labeling, are not essential to the attainment of effective body  drug concentrations on chronic use, and are considered medically  insignificant for the particular drug product studied.
