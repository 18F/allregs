Such a statement may also be used for 2017 and 2018 model year vehicles only if the application for certification for those vehicles is based upon data carried over from a prior model year, as allowed under this subpart. No 2019 and later model year vehicles may be waived from testing for N2O emissions. Such a statement must be based on previous emission tests, development tests, or other appropriate information and good engineering judgment. Vehicles certified to N2O standards using a compliance statement in lieu of submitting test data are not required to collect and submit N2O emission data under the in-use verification testing requirements of Sec. 86.1845.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaporative/Refueling testing. Vehicles of each evaporative/refueling family will be divided into evaporative/refueling emission control systems. Applicability of the refueling test requirements of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with the applicability of the refueling loss standards under the provisions of Sec. 86.1810.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Testing at low altitude. One EDV in each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/refueling emission control system combination must be tested in accordance with the evaporative/refueling test procedure requirement of subpart B of this part. The configuration of the EDV will be determined under the provisions of Sec. 86.1828-01. The EDV must also be tested for exhaust emission compliance using the FTP and SFTP procedures of subpart B of this part. In lieu of testing natural gas or

hydrogen fueled vehicles to demonstrate compliance with the evaporative and refueling emission standards specified in this subpart, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation of appropriate testing and/or design parameters, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles comply with applicable emission standards. This same testing exemption applies for vehicles fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, except that refueling tests are required for systems that allow venting during the refueling operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Testing at high altitude. For high-altitude evaporative and/or refueling emission compliance for each evaporative/refueling family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the following two procedures:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> One EDV in each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/refueling emission control system combination shall be tested in accordance with the evaporative/refueling test procedure requirement of subpart B of this part. The configuration of the EDV will be determined under the provisions of Sec. 86.1824-01. The EDV must also be tested for exhaust emissions using the FTP procedures of subpart B of this part while operated at high altitude; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In lieu of testing vehicles according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation of such high-altitude emission testing as the manufacturer deems appropriate, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles comply with the emission standards at high altitude.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Optional waiver of two-diurnal evaporative certification test for gasoline- and ethanol-fueled vehicles. In lieu of testing gasoline-fueled and ethanol-fueled vehicles for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence according to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, a manufacturer may optionally provide a statement of compliance in its application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's good engineering judgement, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles in the applicable evaporative/refueling emission family comply with the evaporative emission standard for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The option to provide a statement of compliance in lieu of 2-diurnal evaporative certification test data outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section is limited to vehicles with conventional evaporative emission control systems (as determined by the Administrator). This option may be used for vehicles in evaporative/refueling families which are certified to the applicable two-diurnal, three-diurnal, running loss, and refueling emission standards. EPA may perform confirmatory 2-diurnal evaporative emission testing on certification test vehicles which are certified using this option (even though the manufacturer may not have performed a 2-diurnal evaporative test during the certification process). If data shows noncompliance, noncompliance will be addressed through 86.1851. As well, if data shows noncompliance, EPA may not normally allow for subsequent waivers for the applicable evaporative family.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Manufacturers shall supply information if requested by EPA in support of the statement of compliance outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. This information shall include evaporative calibration information for the emission-data test vehicle and for other vehicles in the evaporative/refueling family, including, but not limited to, canister type, canister volume, canister working capacity, fuel tank volume, fuel tank geometry, the type of fuel delivery system (return, returnless, variable flow fuel pump, etc.), a description of the input parameters and software strategy used to control the evaporative canister purge, the nominal purge flow volume (in bed volumes) when vehicles are driven over the 2-diurnal (FTP) driving cycle, the nominal purge flow volume (in bed volumes) when vehicles are driven over the 3-diurnal (FTP + running loss) driving cycle, and other supporting information as necessary to demonstrate that the purge flow rate calibration on the 2-diurnal test sequence is adequate

to comply with the evaporative emission standard for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For diesel-fueled light-duty vehicles, a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the refueling emission standard instead of submitting test data. Such a statement must be based on previous emission tests, development tests, or other appropriate information, and good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cold temperature CO and cold temperature NMHC Testing. The manufacturer must test one EDV in each durability group for cold temperature CO and cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission compliance in accordance with the test procedures in subpart C of this part or with alternative procedures approved in advance by the Administrator. The selection of which EDV and test group within the durability group will be tested for cold temperature CO and cold temperature NMHC compliance will be determined under the provisions of Sec. 86.1828-10(c) and (g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. For electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with all the requirements of this subpart instead of submitting test data. Such a statement must be based on previous emission tests, development tests, or other appropriate information, and good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Idle CO testing.
