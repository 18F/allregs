                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 27.303(b)(1), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Patent Rights--Ownership by the Contractor (MAY 2014)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Invention means any invention or discovery that is or may be  patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S. Code, or  any variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant  Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.)</p><p class="depth0">Made means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When used in relation to any invention other than a plant  variety, the conception or first actual reduction to practice of the  invention; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When used in relation to a plant variety, that the Contractor  has at least tentatively determined that the variety has been reproduced  with recognized characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">Nonprofit organization means a university or other institution of  higher education or an organization of the type described in section  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of   1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of  the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)), or any nonprofit  scientific or educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit  organization statute.</p><p class="depth0">Practical application means to manufacture, in the case of a  composition of product; to practice, in the case of a process or method;  or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case,  under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being  utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or  Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p><p class="depth0">Subject invention means any invention of the Contractor made in the  performance of work under this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contractor's rights (1) Ownership. The Contractor may retain  ownership of each subject invention throughout the world in accordance  with the provisions of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> License. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive royalty- free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the  Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the  invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.  The Contractor's license extends to any domestic subsidiaries and  affiliates within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a  part, and includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the  Contractor was legally obligated to do so at contract award. The license  is transferable only with the written approval of the agency, except  when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's  business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor's license may be revoked or modified by the  agency to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical  application of the subject invention in a particular country in  accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.302(i)(2) and 27.304-1(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contractor's obligations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall disclose in  writing each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2  months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor  personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure shall identify  the inventor(s) and this contract under which the subject invention was  made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a  clear understanding of the subject invention. The disclosure shall also  identify any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or  public use of the subject invention, or whether a manuscript describing  the subject invention has been submitted for publication and, if so,  whether it has been accepted for publication. In addition, after  disclosure to the agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the  Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the  subject invention for publication and any on sale or public use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain  ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer  within 2 years of disclosure to the agency. However, in any case where  publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory  period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the  United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the  agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the  statutory period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall file either a provisional or a  nonprovisional patent application or a Plant Variety Protection  Application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after  election. However, in any case where a publication, on sale, or public  use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent  protection can be obtained in the United States, the Contractor shall  file the application prior to the end of that statutory period. If the  Contractor files a provisional application, it shall file a  nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of the  provisional application. The Contractor shall file patent applications  in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10  months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or  nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the  Commissioner of Patents to file foreign patent applications where such  filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure,  election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this  clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Government's rights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ownership. The Contractor shall assign  to the agency, on written request, title to any subject invention--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect ownership to the  subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this  clause, or elects not to retain ownership; provided, that the agency may  request title only within 60 days after learning of the Contractor's  failure to disclose or elect within the specified times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent  applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause;  provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application  in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause,  but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the  Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue  the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on,  or defend in reexamination   or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> License. If the Contractor retains ownership of any subject  invention, the Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable,  irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on  its behalf, the subject invention throughout the world.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the  agency all instruments necessary to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout  the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to  retain ownership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph (d)  of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection  and plant variety protection for that subject invention in any country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall require, by written agreement, its  employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose  promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the  administration of patent matters and in the Contractor's format, each  subject invention in order that the Contractor can comply with the  disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute  all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions  and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The  disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required  by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such  employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational  programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient  time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or  foreign statutory bars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any  decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the  prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in  a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country,  not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing  period required by the relevant patent office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any  United States nonprovisional patent or plant variety protection  application and any patent or plant variety protection certificate  issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement,  ``This invention was made with Government support under (identify the  contract) awarded by (identify the agency). The Government has certain  rights in the invention.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor  shall submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than  annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at  obtaining utilization of the subject invention that are being made by  the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. The reports shall include  information regarding the status of development, date of first  commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and  other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The  Contractor also shall provide additional reports as may be requested by  the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the  agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. The Contractor  also shall mark any utilization report as confidential/proprietary to  help prevent inadvertent release outside the Government. As required by  35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency will not disclose that information to  persons outside the Government without the Contractor's permission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this clause, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall  grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject  invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any  products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of  the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United  States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for an agreement  may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its  assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to  grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be  likely to manufacture substantially in the United States, or that under  the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> March-in rights. The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect  to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency  has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c),  and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any  supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract  award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations.  If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not assign rights to a subject invention in the United States  without the written approval of the agency, except where an assignment  is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the  management of inventions, provided, that the assignee shall be subject  to the same provisions as the Contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Share royalties collected on a subject invention with the  inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through   their agency if the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject  invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR  401.10;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the  Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses  (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of  subject inventions for the support of scientific research or education;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to  attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business  concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when  licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the  small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the  invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the  invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from  applicants that are not small business concerns; provided, that the  Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the  capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision  whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the  discretion of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's  licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and  negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices  with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses  that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively  implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Communications. [Complete according to agency instructions.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Subcontracts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall include the substance of  this clause, including this paragraph (k), in all subcontracts for  experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small  business concern or nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall include in all other subcontracts for  experimental, developmental, or research work the substance of the  patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At all tiers, the patent rights clause must be modified to  identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not  changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the  Contractor in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as part of the  consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the  subcontractor's subject inventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In subcontracts, at any tier, the agency, the subcontractor, and  the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created  by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the  agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided,  however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any  jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes statute in connection with  proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(3), add the  following sentence at the end of paragraph (d)(2) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth0">The license shall include the right of the Government to sublicense  foreign governments, their nationals and international organizations  pursuant to the following treaties or international agreements: -------- ------*</p><p class="depth0">[* Contracting Officer complete with the names of applicable  existing treaties or international agreements. The above language is not  intended to apply to treaties or agreements that are in effect on the  date of the award but are not listed.]</p><p class="depth0">Alternate II (DEC 2007). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(4), add the  following sentence at the end of paragraph (d)(2) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth0">The agency reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to  identify specific treaties or international agreements entered into by  the Government before or after the effective date of the contract and  effectuate those license or other rights that are necessary for the  Government to meet its obligations to foreign governments, their  nationals, and international organizations under the treaties or  international agreements with respect to subject inventions made after  the date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate III (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(5), substitute  the following paragraph (i)(3) in place of paragraph (i)(3) of the basic  clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, payments to  inventors, and other expenses incidental to the administration of  subject inventions, the balance of any royalties or income earned and  retained by the Contractor during any fiscal year on subject inventions  under this or any successor contract containing the same requirement, up  to any amount equal to 5 percent of the budget of the facility for that  fiscal year, shall be used by the Contractor for the scientific  research, development, and education consistent with the research and  development mission and objectives of the facility, including activities  that increase the licensing potential of other inventions of the  facility. If the balance exceeds 5 percent, 75 percent of the excess  above 5 percent shall be   paid by the Contractor to the Treasury of the United States and the  remaining 25 percent shall be used by the Contractor only for the same  purposes as described above. To the extent it provides the most  effective technology transfer, the licensing of subject inventions shall  be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate IV (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(6), include the  following paragraph (e)(5) in paragraph (e) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective  procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and  timely disclosed, and shall submit a description of the procedures to  the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting Officer may evaluate and  determine their effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate V.

The agreement shall be negotiated prior to the Contractor  undertaking the CRADA work or, with the permission of the Government,  upon the identification of a subject invention. In the absence of such  an agreement, the Contractor agrees to grant the collaborating party or  parties an option for a license in its inventions of the same scope and  terms set forth in the CRADA for inventions made by the Government.
