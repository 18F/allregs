                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Air Force, in compliance with Executive Order 12600, will  advise submitters of contractor-submitted records when a FOIA requester  seeks the release of such records, regardless of any initial  determination as to whether FOIA exemption (b)(4) applies. See  Sec. 806.15(c) and Sec. 806.31. Due to a change to 48 CFR, submitter  notification is not required prior to release of unit prices contained  in contracts awarded based upon solicitations issued after January 1,  1998. For solicitations issued before January 1, 1998, conduct a normal  submitter notice. Unit prices contained in proposals provided prior to  contract award are protected from release, as are all portions of  unsuccessful proposals (before and after contract award) (10 U.S.C.  2305(g)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b).)</em> An example  of a memo advising 11 CS/SCSR of State Department involvement in an Air  Force FOIA action is provided in Sec. 806.27.</p>
