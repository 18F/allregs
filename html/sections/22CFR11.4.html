The Executive Director of the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, with the concurrence of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Medical Services, may make such exceptions to these physical requirements as are in the interest of the Service. All such exceptions shall be reported to the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service at its next meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The medical examination will be conducted by medical officers of the Armed Forces, the Public Health Service, the Department, accredited colleges and universities, or, with the approval of the Board of Examiners, by private physicians.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Medical Services will determine, on the basis of the report of the physician(s) who conducted the medical examination, whether the candidate has met the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
