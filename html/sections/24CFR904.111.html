                                Sec. 904.111  Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of reserve. The LHA shall establish and maintain a  separate NRMR for each home, using a portion of the homebuyer's monthly  payment. The purpose of the NRMR is to provide funds for the nonroutine  maintenance of the home, which consists of the infrequent and costly  items of maintenance and replacement shown on the Nonroutine Maintenance  Schedule for the home (see paragraph (b) of this section). Such  maintenance may include the replacement of dwelling equipment (such as  range and refrigerator), replacement of roof, exterior painting, major  repairs to heating and plumbing systems, etc. The NRMR shall not be used  for nonroutine maintenance of common property, or for nonroutine  maintenance relating to the home to the extent such maintenance is  attributable to the Homebuyer's negligence or to defective materials or  workmanship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of reserve. The amount of the monthly payments to be set  aside for NRMR shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD,  on the basis of the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule showing the amount  likely to be needed for nonroutine maintenance of the home during the  term of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, taking into  consideration the type of construction and dwelling equipment. This  Schedule shall (1) list each item of nonroutine maintenance (e.g.,  range, refrigerator, plumbing, heating system, roofing, tile flooring,  exterior painting, etc.), (2) show for   each listed item the estimated frequency of maintenance or useful life  before replacement, the estimated cost of maintenance or replacement  (including installation) for each occasion, and the annual reserve  requirement, and (3) show the total reserve requirements for all the  listed items, on an annual and a monthly basis. This Schedule shall be  prepared by the LHA and approved by HUD as part of the submission  required to determine the financial feasibility of the Project. The  Schedule shall be revised after approval of the working drawings and  specifications, and shall thereafter be reexamined annually in the light  of changing economic conditions and experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charges to NRMR. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The LHA shall provide the nonroutine  maintenance necessary for the home and the cost thereof shall be funded  as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such maintenance may be  provided by the homebuyer but only pursuant to a prior written agreement  with the LHA covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of  credit the homebuyer is to receive. The amount of any credit shall, upon  completion of the work, be credited to the homebuyer's EHPA and charged  as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of nonroutine maintenance shall be charged to the NRMR  for the home except that (i) to the extent such maintenance is  attributable to the fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall  be charged to the homebuyer's EHPA after consultation with the HBA if  the hombuyer disagrees, and (ii) to the extent such maintenance is  attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by  warranty, or even though covered by warranty if not paid for thereunder  through no fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall be  charged to the appropriate operating expense account of the Project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event the amount charged against the NRMR exceeds the  balance therein, the difference (deficit) shall be made up from  continuing monthly credits to the NRMR based upon the homebuyer's  monthly payments. If there is still a deficit when the homebuyer  acquires title, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit at settlement (see  paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of NRMR. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event the Homebuyer's Ownership  Opportunity Agreement is terminated, the homebuyer shall not receive any  balance or be required to pay any deficit in the NRMR. When a subsequent  homebuyer moves in, the NRMR shall continue to be applicable to the home  in the same amount as if the preceding homebuyer had continued in  occupancy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event the homebuyer purchases the home, and there remains  a balance in the NRMR, the LHA shall pay such balance to the homebuyer  at settlement. In the event the homebuyer purchases and there is a  deficit in the NRMR, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit to the LHA at  settlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Investment of excess. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the aggregate amount of the NRMR  balances for all the homes exceeds the estimated reserve requirements  for 90 days the LHA shall invest the excess in federally insured savings  accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by  HUD. Income earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and  credited to each homebuyer's NRMR in proportion to the amount in each  reserve account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the LHA  shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all NRMR  balances, (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts  and/or securities) held for the account of the NRMRs, and (iii) the  aggregate uninvested balance of the NRMRs. A copy of this statement  shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</p>
