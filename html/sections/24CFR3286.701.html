The requirements in subpart A of  this part are applicable in all states, the requirements in subparts B  through H are applicable in states where the HUD-administered  installation program operates, and the requirements in subpart I are  applicable in states with qualifying installation programs. It is the  policy of the Secretary, regarding manufactured home installation  program enforcement matters, to cooperate with state or local agencies  having authority to regulate the installation of manufactured homes. In  addition to actions expressly recognized under this subpart H and other  provisions in this part, however, HUD may take any actions authorized by  the Act in order to oversee the system established by the regulations in  this part.</p>
