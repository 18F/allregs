                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following ongoing requirements govern all ESV licensees and operations in the 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) and 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) bands transmitting to GSO satellites in the Fixed-Satellite Service. ESV licensees must comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section and all of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(13) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies items that must be included in the application for ESV operations to demonstrate that these ongoing requirements will be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses transmitters with off-axis effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) spectral-densities lower than or equal to the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, operating under this section shall provide a detailed demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The ESV transmitter must also comply with the antenna pointing and cessation of emission requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An ESV system shall not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits and conditions defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The off-axis EIRP spectral-density emitted from the ESV, in the plane of the GSO as it appears at the particular earth station location, shall not exceed the following values:

Where theta ([thetas]) is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the orbital location of the target satellite, the plane of the GSO is determined by the focal point of the antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital location of the target satellite. For an ESV network using frequency division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques, N is equal to one. For ESV networks using multiple co-frequency transmitters that have the same EIRP, N is the maximum expected number of co-frequency simultaneously transmitting ESV earth stations in the same satellite receiving beam. For the purpose of this section, the peak EIRP of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the envelope defined above for [thetas] between 1.5[deg] and 7.0[deg]. For [thetas] greater than 7.0[deg], the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the envelope given above by more than 3 dB.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In all directions other than along the GSO, the off-axis EIRP spectral-density for co-polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not exceed the following values:

Where [thetas] and N are defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. This off-axis EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the orbital location of the target satellite with the exception of the plane of the GSO as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)

of this section. For the purpose of this section, the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 10% of the sidelobes provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain envelope given above by more than 6 dB. The region of the main reflector spillover energy is to be interpreted as a single lobe and shall not exceed the envelope by more than 6 dB.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In all directions, the off-axis EIRP spectral-density for cross-polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not exceed the following values:

An ESV or ESV system operating under this paragraph (a)(2) shall file certifications and provide a detailed demonstration(s) as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ESV shall transmit only to the target satellite system(s) referred to in the certifications required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a good faith agreement cannot be reached between the target satellite operator and the operator of a future satellite that is located within 6 degrees longitude of the target satellite, the ESV operator shall accept the power-density levels that would accommodate that adjacent satellite.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ESV shall operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP spectral-densities that the ESV supplied to the target satellite operator in order to obtain the certifications listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Except for ESVs with variable power systems, the ESV shall automatically cease emissions within 100 milliseconds if the ESV transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP spectral-densities supplied to the

target satellite operator. For ESVs using variable power systems, the individual ESV transmitter shall automatically cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds if the ESV transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP-density limits supplied to the target satellite operator; the individual transmitter must be self-monitoring and capable of shutting itself off; and if one or more ESV transmitters causes the aggregate off-axis EIRP-densities to exceed the off-axis EIRP-density limits supplied to the target satellite operator, then the transmitter or transmitters shall cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds of receiving a command from the system's central control and monitoring station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following requirements shall apply to an ESV system that uses variable power-density control of individual simultaneously transmitting co-frequency ESV earth stations in the same satellite receiving beam unless that ESV system operates pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

In this context the term ``effective'' means that the resultant co-polarized and cross-polarized EIRP-density experienced by any GSO or non-GSO satellite shall not exceed that produced by a single transmitter operating 1 dB below the off-axis EIRP-density limits defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. An ESV system operating under this paragraph (a)(3) shall provide a detailed demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual ESV transmitter shall automatically cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds if the ESV transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP-density limits specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. The individual transmitter must be self-monitoring and capable of shutting itself off. If one or more ESV transmitters causes the aggregate off-axis EIRP-densities to exceed the off-axis EIRP-density limits specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, then the transmitter or transmitters shall cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds of receiving a command from the system's central control and monitoring station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the ESVs, either directly or through the facilities of a U.S. Hub or a Hub located in another country with which the United States has a bilateral agreement that enables such cessation of emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each ESV transmitter, a record of the ship location (i.e., latitude/longitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and satellite used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of not less than 1 year. Records will be recorded at time intervals no greater than every 20 minutes while the ESV is transmitting. The ESV operator will make this data available upon request to a coordinator, fixed system operator, Fixed-Satellite system operator, or the Commission within 24 hours of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ESV operators communicating with vessels of foreign registry must maintain detailed information on each vessel's country of registry and a point of contact for the relevant administration responsible for licensing ESVs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> ESV operators shall control all ESVs by a hub earth station located in the United States, except that an ESV on U.S.-registered vessels may operate under control of a hub earth station location outside the United States provided the ESV operator maintains a point of contact within the United States that will have the capability and authority to cause an ESV on a U.S.-registered vessel to cease transmitting if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ESV operators transmitting in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) frequency band to GSO satellites in the Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) shall not seek to coordinate, in any geographic location, more than 36 megahertz of uplink bandwidth on each of no more than two GSO FSS satellites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> ESVs shall not operate in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) and 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands on vessels smaller than 300 gross tons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> ESVs, operating while docked, that complete coordination with terrestrial stations in the 3700-4200 MHz band in accordance with Sec. 25.251, shall receive protection from such terrestrial stations in accordance with the coordination agreements, for 180 days, renewable for 180 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> ESVs in motion shall not claim protection from harmful interference from any authorized terrestrial stations or lawfully operating satellites to which frequencies are either already assigned, or may be assigned in the future in the 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) frequency band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> ESVs operating within 200 km from the baseline of the United States, or within 200 km from a U.S.-licensed fixed service offshore installation, shall complete coordination with potentially affected U.S.-licensed fixed service operators prior to operation. The coordination method and the interference criteria objective shall be determined by the frequency coordinator. The details of the coordination shall be maintained and available at the frequency coordinator, and shall be filed with the Commission electronically via the International Bureau Filing System (http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/) to be placed on public notice. The coordination notifications must be filed in the form of a statement referencing the relevant call signs and file numbers. Operation of each individual ESV may commence immediately after the public notice is released that identifies the notification sent to the Commission. Continuance of operation of that ESV for the duration of the coordination term shall be dependent upon successful completion of the normal public notice process. If, prior to the end of the 30-day comment period of the public notice, any objections are received from U.S.-licensed Fixed Service operators that have been excluded from coordination, the ESV licensee must immediately cease operation of that particular station on frequencies used by the affected U.S.-licensed Fixed Service station until the coordination dispute is resolved and the ESV licensee informs the Commission of the resolution. As used in this section, ``baseline'' means the line from which maritime zones are measured. The baseline is a combination of the low-water line and closing lines across the mouths of inland water bodies and is defined by a series of baseline points that include islands and ``low-water elevations,'' as determined by the U.S. Department of State's Baseline Committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> ESV operators must automatically cease transmission if the ESV operates in violation of the terms of its coordination agreement, including, but not limited to, conditions related to speed of the vessel or if the ESV travels outside the coordinated area, if within 200 km from the baseline of the United States, or within 200 km from a U.S.-licensed fixed service offshore installation.
