For purposes of this  section, ``water supply restoration projects'' are those that protect,  repair, replace, construct, or enhance facilities related to water  supplies, including water distribution facilities and treatment plants  that have been adversely affected by coal mining practices. For funds  awarded before December 20, 2006, any uncertified State or Indian tribe  may expend up to 30 percent of the funds distributed to it for water  supply restoration projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, if the State or Indian tribe finds in writing, as part of its  eligibility opinion, that such adverse affects are due predominately to  effects of mining processes undertaken and abandoned prior to August 3,  1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this  section occurred both prior to and after the dates (and under the  criteria) set forth under section 402(g)(4)(B) of the Act, the project  shall remain eligible, notwithstanding the criteria specified in 30 CFR  874.12(b), if the State or Indian tribe finds in writing, as part of its  eligibility opinion, that such adverse effects are due predominately to  the effects of mining processes undertaken and abandoned prior to those  dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enhancement of facilities or utilities under this section shall  include upgrading necessary to meet any local, State, or Federal public  health or safety requirement. Enhancement shall not include, however,  any service area expansion of a utility or facility not necessary to  address a specific abandoned mine land problem.
