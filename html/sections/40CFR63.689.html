                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply to the control of air  emissions from transfer systems for which Sec.  63.683(b)(1)(i) of this  subpart references the use of this section for such air emission  control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each transfer system that is subject to this section and is  an individual drain system, the owner or operator shall control air  emissions in accordance with the standards specified in 40 CFR part 63,  subpart RR--National Emission Standards for Individual Drain Systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transfer system that uses covers in accordance with the  requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A transfer system that consists of continuous hard-piping. All  joints or seams between the pipe sections shall be permanently or semi- permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal  pipe or a bolted and gasketed flange).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transfer system is designed and operated such that an  internal pressure in the vapor headspace in the enclosure is maintained  at a level less than atmospheric pressure when the control device is  operating, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The closed-vent system and control device are designed and  operated in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  63.693 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(6)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cover and its closure devices shall be designed to form a  continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the off-site material  as it is conveyed by the transfer system except for the openings at the  inlet and outlet to the transfer system through which the off-site  material passes. The inlet and outlet openings used for passage of the  off-site material through the transfer system shall be the minimum size  required for practical operation of the transfer system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cover shall be installed in a manner such that there are no  visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between cover section  joints or between the interface of the cover edge and its mounting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except for the inlet and outlet openings to the transfer system  through which the off-site material passes, each opening in the cover  shall be equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that  when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no  visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the   closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure  device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cover and its closure devices shall be made of suitable  materials that will minimize exposure of the off-site material to the  atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of  the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be  considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and  closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability; the effects  of any contact with the material or its vapors conveyed in the transfer  system; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight;  and the operating practices used for the transfer system on which the  cover is installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whenever an off-site material is in the transfer system, the  cover shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed  position, except the opening of closure devices or removal of the cover  is allowed to provide access to the transfer system for performing  routine inspection, maintenance, repair, or other activities needed for  normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when  a worker needs to open a hatch or remove the cover to repair conveyance  equipment mounted under the cover or to clear a blockage of material  inside the system. Following completion of the activity, the owner or  operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position  or reinstall the cover, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control  equipment in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.695  of this subpart.
