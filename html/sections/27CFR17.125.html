                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adoption of predecessor's formulas. If there is a change in the  proprietorship of a nonbeverage plant and the successor desires to use  the predecessor's formulas at the same location, the successor may, in  lieu of submitting new formulas in its own name, adopt any or all of the  formulas of the predecessor by filing a notice of adoption with the  appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be filed with the first claim  relating to any of the adopted formulas. The notice shall list, by name  and serial number, all formulas to be adopted, and shall state that the  products will be manufactured in accordance with the adopted formulas  and processes. The notice shall be accompanied by a certified copy of  the articles of incorporation or other document(s) necessary to prove  the transfer of ownership. The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the  notice with the related formulas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adoption of manufacturer's own formulas from a different  location. A manufacturer's own formulas may be adopted for use at  another of the manufacturer's plants. Further, a wholly owned subsidiary  may adopt the formulas of the parent company, and vice versa. A  letterhead notice must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer and be  accompanied by two photocopies of each formula to be adopted. The notice  shall list the numbers of all formulas to be adopted and shall indicate  the plant where each was originally approved and the plant(s) where each  is to be adopted. Some evidence of the relationship between the plants  involved in the adoption shall be attached to the notice. The notice  shall be referenced in Part IV of the supporting data (TTB Form 5154.2)  filed with the first claim relating to the adopted formula(s).  [T.D. ATF-179, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436,  66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]</p>
