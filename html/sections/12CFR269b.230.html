With respect to each case where an investigation is  directed by the panel, the charging party may, in the discretion of the  panel, be required to file a cost bond, or equivalent security, of $500,  unless the panel fixes a different amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Among the circumstances that may be the basis for payment of  costs by other than the panel are cases where a clearly spurious charge  has been filed or where the filing of a charge was necessary to redress  the respondent's flagrant misconduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The bond or equivalent security shall be to secure the payment  of the costs of the investigation as may be assessed by the panel. In  those cases where the panel does not assess such costs, the bond posted  and the cost thereof shall be reimbursed to the charging party. The  panel may require also the posting of a cost bond by the respondent or  other party to the proceeding, who shall be entitled to reimbursement of  the cost of the bond in the event that no costs of investigation are  assessed upon such party by the panel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification of the panel's decision that a bond shall be  required shall be effected by registered mail, such notice to advise of  the amount of the bond required and the period by which it shall be  posted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Absent good cause shown, failure of a party to file timely such  cost bond or equivalent security may be ground for dismissal or other  administrative sanctions deemed appropriate by the Panel.</p>
