Cable systems may be eligible for this exemption where they demonstrate with engineering studies prepared in accordance with Sec.  73.686 of this chapter or other showings that broadcast signals meeting the above criteria are not actually viewable within the community.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a new full service broadcast television station, or new non-commercial educational television translator station with 5 or more watts, or an existing such station of either type with newly upgraded facilities provides predicted Grade B service to a community served by a cable system previously exempt under paragraph (a) of this section, or the signal of any such broadcast station is newly determined to be ``significantly viewed'' in the county where such a cable system is located, the cable system at that time is required to comply fully with the provisions of Sec.  76.66. Cable systems may retain their exemption under paragraph (a) of this section where they demonstrate with engineering studies prepared in accordance with Sec.  73.686 of this chapter or other showings that broadcast signals meeting the above criteria are not actually viewable within the community.
