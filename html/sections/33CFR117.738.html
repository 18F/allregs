The gages shall be so placed on the bridge that they are plainly visible to operators of vessels approaching the bridge either up or downstream.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Trains and locomotives shall be controlled so that any delay in opening the draw span shall not exceed five minutes. However, if a train moving toward the bridge has crossed the home signal for the bridge before the signal requesting opening of the bridge is given, the train may continue across the bridge and must clear the bridge interlocks before stopping.
