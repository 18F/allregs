                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Although a wide range of programs may be eligible to apply for and  receive support from the Corporation, all AmeriCorps subtitle C programs  must   meet certain minimum program requirements. These requirements apply  regardless of whether a program is supported directly by the Corporation  or through a subgrant. All AmeriCorps programs must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Address educational, public safety, human, or environmental  needs, and provide a direct and demonstrable benefit that is valued by  the community in which the service is performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Perform projects that are designed, implemented, and evaluated  with extensive and broad-based local input, including consultation with  representatives from the community served, participants (or potential  participants) in the program, community-based agencies with a  demonstrated record of experience in providing services, and local labor  organizations representing employees of project sponsors (if such  entities exist in the area to be served by the program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Obtain, in the case of a program that also proposes to serve as  the project sponsor, the written concurrence of any local labor  organization representing employees of the project sponsor who are  engaged in the same or substantially similar work as that proposed to be  carried out by the AmeriCorps participant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Establish and provide outcome objectives, including a strategy  for achieving these objectives, upon which self-assessment and  Corporation-assessment of progress can rest. Such assessment will be  used to help determine the extent to which the program has had a  positive impact: (1) On communities and persons served by the projects  performed by the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On participants who take part in the projects; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In such other areas as the program or Corporation may specify;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Strengthen communities and encourage mutual respect and  cooperation among citizens of different races, ethnicities,  socioeconomic backgrounds, educational levels, both men and women and  individuals with disabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Agree to seek actively to include participants and staff from  the communities in which projects are conducted, and agree to seek  program staff and participants of different races and ethnicities,  socioeconomic backgrounds, educational levels, and genders as well as  individuals with disabilities unless a program design requires  emphasizing the recruitment of staff and participants who share a  specific characteristic or background. In no case may a program violate  the nondiscrimination, nonduplication and nondisplacement rules  governing participant selection described in part 2540 of this chapter.  In addition, programs are encouraged to establish, if consistent with  the purposes of the program, an intergenerational component that  combines students, out-of-school youths, and older adults as  participants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine the projects in which participants will serve and  establish minimum qualifications that individuals must meet to be  eligible to participate in the program; these qualifications may vary  based on the specific tasks to be performed by participants. Regardless  of the educational level or background of participants sought, programs  are encouraged to select individuals who posses leadership potential and  a commitment to the goals of the AmeriCorps program. In any case,  programs must select participants in a non-partisan, non-political, non- discriminatory manner, ensuring fair access to participation. In  addition, programs are required to ensure that they do not displace any  existing paid employees as provided in part 2540 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition, all programs are required to comply with any pre- service orientation or training period requirements established by the  Corporation to assist in the selection of motivated participants.  Finally, all programs must agree to select a percentage (to be  determined by the Corporation) of the participants for the program from  among prospective participants recruited by the Corporation or State  Commissions under part 2533 of this chapter. The Corporation may also  specify a minimum percentage of participants to be selected from the  national leadership pool established under Sec. 2522.210(c). The  Corporation may vary either percentage for different types of AmeriCorps  programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Provide reasonable accommodation, including auxiliary aids and  services (as defined in section 3(1) of the Americans with Disabilities  Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102(1)) based on the individualized need of a  participant who is a qualified individual with a disability (as defined  in section 101(8) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 12111(8)). For the purpose of  complying with this provision, AmeriCorps programs may apply for  additional financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to Sec.  2524.40 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use service experiences to help participants achieve the skills  and education needed for productive, active citizenship, including the  provision, if appropriate, of structured opportunities for participants  to reflect on their service experiences. In addition, all programs must  encourage every participant who is eligible to vote to register prior to  completing a term of service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Provide participants in the program with the training, skills,  and knowledge necessary to perform the tasks required in their  respective projects, including, if appropriate, specific training in a  particular field and background information on the community, including  why the service projects are needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Provide support services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To participants who are completing a term of service and making  the transition to other educational and career opportunities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To those participants who are school dropouts in order to assist  them in earning the equivalent of a high school diploma;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Ensure that participants serving in approved AmeriCorps  positions receive the living allowance and other benefits described in  Sec. Sec. 2522.240 through 2522.250 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Describe the manner in which the AmeriCorps educational awards  will be apportioned among individuals serving in the program. If a  program proposes to provide such benefits to less than 100 percent of  the participants in the program, the program must provide a compelling  rationale for determining which participants will receive the benefits  and which participants will not. AmeriCorps programs are strongly  encouraged to offer alternative post-service benefits to participants  who will not receive AmeriCorps educational awards, however AmeriCorps  grant funds may not be used to provide such benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Agree to identify the program, through the use of logos, common  application materials, and other means (to be specified by the  Corporation), as part of a larger national effort and to participate in  other activities such as common opening ceremonies (including the  administration of a national oath or affirmation), service days, and  conferences designed to promote a national identity for all AmeriCorps  programs and participants, including those participants not receiving  AmeriCorps educational awards. This provision does not preclude an  AmeriCorps program from continuing to use its own name as the primary  identification, or from using its name, logo, or other identifying  materials on uniforms or other items;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Agree to begin terms of service at such times as the Corporation  may reasonably require and to comply with any restrictions the  Corporation may establish as to when the program may take to fill an  approved AmeriCorps position left vacant due to attrition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Comply with all evaluation procedures specified by the  Corporation, as explained in Sec. Sec. 2522.500 through 2522.560;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> In the case of a program receiving funding directly from the  Corporation, meet and consult with the State Commission for the State in  which the program operates, if possible, and submit a copy of the  program application to the State Commission; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Address any other requirements as specified by the Corporation.
