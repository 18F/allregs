                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which  flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal  Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a  basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community  shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from other  Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal  Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood hazard area   designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the  Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining  such special flood hazard designations are set forth in Sec. 64.3 of  this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the  adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-prone areas  adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data  formally provided to the community by the Federal Insurance  Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not defined the  special flood hazard areas within a community, has not provided water  surface elevation data, and has not provided sufficient data to identify  the floodway or coastal high hazard area, but the community has  indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to  participate in the Program, the community shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require permits for all proposed construction or other  development in the community, including the placement of manufactured  homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other  development is proposed within flood-prone areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits  have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval  is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the  Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed  building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed  building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and  substantial improvements shall (i) be designed (or modified) and  adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement  of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,  including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials  resistant to flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices  that minimize flood damages, and (iv) be constructed with electrical,  heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other  service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent  water from entering or accumulating within the components during  conditions of flooding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review subdivision proposals and other proposed new development,  including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether  such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision  proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any  such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals  are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood- prone area, (ii) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,  gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to  minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is  provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water  supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of  flood waters into the systems; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Require within flood-prone areas (i) new and replacement  sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate  infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the  systems into flood waters and (ii) onsite waste disposal systems to be  located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during  flooding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Federal Insurance Administrator has designated areas of  special flood hazards (A zones) by the publication of a community's FHBM  or FIRM, but has neither produced water surface elevation data nor  identified a floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require permits for all proposed construction and other  developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone  A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>,  (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section to development within Zone A on  the community's FHBM or FIRM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed  developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and  subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser,  include within such proposals base flood elevation data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation  and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source,  including data developed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section,  as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial  improvements, or other development in Zone A on the community's FHBM or  FIRM meet the standards in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6),  (c)(12), (c)(14), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where base flood elevation data are utilized, within Zone A on  the community's FHBM or FIRM:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the  lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved  structures, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, the elevation (in relation to  mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the  State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a  watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to the Federal  Insurance Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or  relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A  on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and  practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this  requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist  flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may  include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties  to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State  and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice  of final flood elevations for one or more special flood hazard areas on  the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated other special  flood hazard areas without base flood elevations on the community's  FIRM, but has not identified a regulatory floodway or coastal high  hazard area, the community shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require the standards of paragraph (b) of this section within  all A1-30 zones, AE zones, A zones, AH zones, and AO zones, on the  community's FIRM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require that all new construction and substantial improvements  of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the  community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to  or above the base flood level, unless the community is granted an  exception by the Federal Insurance Administrator for the allowance of  basements in accordance with Sec. 60.6 (b) or (c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require that all new construction and substantial improvements  of non-residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the  community's firm (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated  to or above the base flood level or, (ii) together with attendant  utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base  flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially  impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components  having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads  and effects of buoyancy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide that where a non-residential structure is intended to be  made watertight below the base flood level, (i) a registered  professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review  structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and  shall certify that the design and methods of   construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for  meeting the applicable provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (c)(8)(ii)  of this section, and (ii) a record of such certificates which includes  the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such  structures are floodproofed shall be maintained with the official  designated by the community under Sec. 59.22(a)(9)(iii);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements,  that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely  for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other  than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to  automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by  allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this  requirement must either be certified by a registered professional  engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one  square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding  shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than  one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,  valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the  automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially  improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or  subdivision, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a  manufactured home has incurred ``substantial damage'' as the result of a  flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor  of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood  elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation  system to resist floatation collapse and lateral movement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new  construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have  the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest  adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on  the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is  specified);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new  construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures  (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the  highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in  feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is  specified), or (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary  facilities be completely floodproofed to that level to meet the  floodproofing standard specified in Sec. 60.3(c)(3)(ii);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new  construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including  fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's  FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the  proposed development, when combined with all other existing and  anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation  of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Require within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around  structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed  structures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially  improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision  within Zones A-1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not  subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(6) of this section be  elevated so that either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the  base flood elevation, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers  or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no  less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an  adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse,  and lateral movement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of Sec. 60.3, a community  may approve certain development in Zones Al-30, AE, and AH, on the  community's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base  flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies  for a conditional FIRM revision, fulfills the requirements for such a  revision as established under the provisions of Sec. 65.12, and  receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones  A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meet the permit requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for ``manufactured  homes'' in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
