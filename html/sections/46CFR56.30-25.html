                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to pipe fittings that are mechanically  connected to pipe by such means as ferrules, flared ends, swaging,  elastic strain preload, crimping, bite-type devices, and shape memory  alloys. Fittings to which this section applies must be designed,  constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1387  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 56.01-2). Previously approved  fittings may be retained as long as they are maintained in good  condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flared, flareless and compression fittings may be used within  the service limitations of size, pressure, temperature, and vibration  recommended by the manufacturer and as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Flared, flareless, and compression type tubing fittings may be  used for tube sizes not exceeding 50 millimeters (2 inches) outside  diameter within the limitations of applicable standards and  specifications listed in this section and Sec. 56.60-1 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Flareless fittings must be of a design in which the gripping  member or sleeve must grip or bite into the outer surface of the tube  with sufficient strength to hold the tube against pressure, but without  appreciably distorting the inside tube diameter or reducing the wall  thickness. The gripping member must also form a pressure seal against  the fitting body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For fluid services, other than hydraulic systems, using a  combustible fluid as defined in Sec. 30.10-15 of this chapter and for  fluid services using a flammable fluid as defined in Sec. 30.10-22 of  this chapter, flared fittings must be used; except that flareless  fittings of the nonbite type may be used when the tubing system is of  steel, nickel copper or copper nickel alloy. When using copper or copper  zinc alloy, flared fittings are required. (See also Sec. 56.50-70 for  gasoline fuel systems, Sec. 56.50-75 for diesel fuel systems, and Sec.  58.25-20 for hydraulic systems for steering gear.)
