                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where bulwarks on the weather portions of freeboard or  superstructure decks form wells, ample provision shall be made for  rapidly freeing the deck of water and for draining them. Except as  provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the minimum freeing  port area (A) on each side of the vessel for each well on the freeboard  deck shall be that given by the following formulae in cases where the  sheer in way of the well is standard or greater than standard. The  minimum area for each well on superstructure decks shall be one-half of  the area given by the formulae.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the length of bulwark (l) in the well is 66 feet or less A  = 7.6 + 0.115l (square feet)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where l exceeds 66 feet A = 0.23l (square feet)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> l need in no case be taken as greater than 0.7L.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the bulwark is more than 3.9 feet in average height the  required area shall be increased by 0.04 square feet per foot of length  of well for each foot difference in height. If the bulwark is less than  3 feet in average height, the required area may be decreased by 0.04  square feet per foot of length for each foot difference in height.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In vessels with no sheer the area calculated according to  paragraph (a) of this section shall be increased by 50 percent. Where  the sheer is less than the standard the percentage shall be obtained by  linear interpolation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>:</p><p class="depth2">Table 42.15-70(c) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Area of freeing ports in</p><p class="depth2">Breadth of hatchway or trunk in relation    relation to the total area</p><p class="depth2">to the breadth of vessel                  of the bulwarks ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 40 percent or less........................  20 percent. 75 percent or more........................  10 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Note: The area of freeing ports at intermediate breadths shall be  obtained by linear interpolation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In vessels having superstructures which are open at either or  both ends, adequate provision for freeing the space within such  superstructures shall be provided to the satisfaction of the assigning  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The lower edges of the freeing ports shall be as near the deck  as practicable. Two-thirds of the freeing port area required shall be  provided in the half of the well nearest the lowest point of the sheer  curve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All such openings in the bulwarks shall be protected by rails or  bars spaced approximately 9 inches apart. If shutters are fitted to  freeing ports, ample clearance shall be provided to prevent jamming.  Hinges shall have pins or bearings of noncorrodible material. If  shutters are fitted with securing appliances, these appliances shall be  of approved construction.
