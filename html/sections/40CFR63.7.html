                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and performance test dates. (1) The applicability of this section is set out in Sec. 63.1(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, if required to do performance testing by a relevant standard, and unless a waiver of performance testing is obtained under this section or the conditions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section apply, the owner or operator of the affected source must perform such tests within 180 days of the compliance date for such source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)-(viii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, when an emission standard promulgated under this part is more stringent than the standard proposed (see Sec. 63.6(b)(3)), the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date, or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If the promulgated standard is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after startup of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests at the affected source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, or elsewhere in this part, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (a)(4)(ii), and (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notification of performance test. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source must notify the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to conduct a performance test at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is initially scheduled to begin to allow the Administrator, upon request, to review an approve the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section and to have an observer present during the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event the owner or operator is unable to conduct the performance test on the date specified in the notification requirement specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her control, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator as soon as practicable and without delay prior to the scheduled performance test date and specify the date when the performance test is rescheduled. This notification of delay in conducting the performance test shall not relieve the owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any other applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement, nor will it prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Quality assurance program. (1) The results of the quality assurance program required in this paragraph will be considered by the Administrator when he/she determines the validity of a performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Submission of site-specific test plan. Before conducting a required performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and, if requested by the Administrator, shall submit a site-specific test plan to the Administrator for approval. The test plan shall include a test program summary, the test schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external quality assurance (QA) program. Data quality objectives are the pretest expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submission of site-specific test plan. Before conducting a required performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and, if requested by the Administrator, shall submit a site-specific test plan to the Administrator for approval. The test plan shall include a test program summary, the test schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external quality assurance (QA) program. Data quality objectives are the pretest expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The internal QA program shall include, at a minimum, the activities planned by routine operators and analysts to provide an assessment of test data precision; an example of internal QA is the sampling and analysis of replicate samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement,

further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. ``Commercially available'' means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the

AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preparing the sample;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body

(VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm. The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B) through (C) of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source shall submit the site-specific test plan to the Administrator upon the Administrator's request at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to take place, that is, simultaneously with the notification of intention to conduct a performance test required under paragraph (b) of this section, or on a mutually agreed upon date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a site-specific test plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approval of site-specific test plan. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original plan and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Before disapproving any site-specific test plan, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the plan together with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended disapproval, additional information to the Administrator before final action on the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific test plan within the time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following conditions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the test method(s) specified in the relevant standard or with only minor changes to those tests methods (see paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), the owner or operator must conduct the performance test within the time specified in this section using the specified method(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method when the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) or after the alternative method is approved (see paragraph (f) of this section). However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval 45 days after submission of the site-specific test plan or request to use an alternative method. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to

use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Neither the submission of a site-specific test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Performance testing facilities. If required to do performance testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source, shall provide performance testing facilities as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such source. This includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe sampling platform(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe access to sampling platform(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any other facilities that the Administrator deems necessary for safe and adequate testing of a source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conduct of performance tests. (1) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected source. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test, nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the relevant standard during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction be considered a violation of the relevant standard unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard or a determination of noncompliance is made under Sec. 63.6(e). Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this section, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter unless the Administrator--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor changes in methodology (see definition in Sec. 63.90(a)). Such changes may be approved in conjunction with approval of the site-specific test plan (see paragraph (c) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approves the use of an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method (see definitions in Sec. 63.90(a)), the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific affected source is in compliance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approves shorter sampling times or smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Waives the requirement for performance tests because the owner or operator of an affected source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the relevant standard. For the purpose of determining compliance with a relevant standard, the arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run in the event that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Extreme meteorological conditions occur; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section shall be construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Use of an alternative test method--(1)General. Until authorized to use an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source required to do performance testing by a relevant standard may use an alternative test method from that specified in the standard provided that the owner or operator--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notifies the Administrator of his or her intention to use an alternative test method at least 60 days before the performance test is scheduled to begin;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Uses Method 301 in appendix A of this part to validate the alternative test method. This may include the use of specific procedures of Method 301 if use of such procedures are sufficient to validate the alternative test method; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Submits the results of the Method 301 validation process along with the notification of intention and the justification for not using the specified test method. The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the deadline specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the performance test date specified in this section or the relevant standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator will determine whether the owner or operator's validation of the proposed alternative test method is adequate and issue an approval or disapproval of the alternative test method. If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval/disapproval 45 days after submission of the request to use an alternative method and the request satisfies the requirements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative test method for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with a relevant standard, the Administrator may require the use of a test method specified in a relevant standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the owner or operator uses an alternative test method for an affected source during a required performance test, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative test method for subsequent performance tests at that affected source until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another test method as allowed under Sec. 63.7(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate an alternative test method shall abrogate the owner or operator's responsibility to comply with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Data analysis, recordkeeping, and reporting. (1) Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, results of a performance test shall include the analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data. A performance

test is ``completed'' when field sample collection is terminated. The owner or operator of an affected source shall report the results of the performance test to the Administrator before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator (see Sec. 63.9(i)). The results of the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under Sec. 63.9(h). Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the appropriate permitting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a minimum of 5 years after a performance test is conducted, the owner or operator shall retain and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator the records or results of such performance test and other data needed to determine emissions from an affected source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Waiver of performance tests. (1) Until a waiver of a performance testing requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual performance tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Request to waive a performance test. (i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under Sec. 63.6(i), the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance.
