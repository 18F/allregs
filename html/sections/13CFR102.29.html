                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. Except where accountings of disclosures  are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this  section), an individual may make a request for an accounting of any  disclosure that has been made by the SBA to another person,  organization, or agency of any record in a system of records about him  or her. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each  disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization,  or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an  accounting should identify each particular record in question and should  be made by writing directly to the SBA office that maintains the record,  following the procedures in Sec. 102.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where accountings are not required. Offices are not required to  provide accountings where they relate to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept;  disclosures that are made to employees within the SBA and disclosures  that are made under the FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law  enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law  enforcement agencies specifying the civil or criminal law enforcement  activities for which the disclosures are sought; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that  have been exempted from accounting requirements under Privacy Act, 5  U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by notice published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals. An individual may appeal a denial of a request for an  accounting to the FOI/PA Office in the same manner as a denial of a  request for access to records (see Sec. 102.27), and the same procedures  will be followed.</p>
