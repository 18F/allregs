                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The evaluation of color shall be determined within five minutes after the olives are removed from the container and is based upon the uniformity of the exterior color or general appearance as to color of the olives within the container. The evaluation of color in ``halved'' style is based on the uncut surfaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Color measurement of ripe type. The color of ripe type is determined by comparison with a spinning disc of variations in percentages of the following Munsell color discs: Red (5R 4/14), Yellow (2.5Y 8/12), and Black (N/1 Glossy).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Composite color standards. Composite USDA Color Standards for Canned Ripe Olives are available and are comparable to the colors produced by the spinning discs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Color appearance of green-ripe type. Normal color for green-ripe type olives is yellow-green, green-yellow, or other greenish casts, any of which may have a mottled appearance that is typical of green-ripe type olives. Off-color means dark brown, dark purple or black olives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The USDA spinning color discs and the USDA composite color standards cited in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are available from the USDA licensed supplier:
Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2441 North Calvert Street, Baltimore, Md. 21218.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Grade A. Canned ripe olives that have a good color may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good color'' has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a practically uniform black or dark brown color. Not less than 90 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 3\1/2\ percent Red, 3\1/2\ percent Yellow, and 93 percent Black.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Segmented; sliced, chopped. The general color impression of the olive as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives with good color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives shall be normal. Not less than 90 percent, by count, shall be practically uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color olives may be present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Grade B. If the canned ripe olives have a reasonably good color, a score of 24 to 26 points may be given. ``Reasonably good color'' has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a reasonably uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 80 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent Yellow, and 88 percent Black.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives with reasonably good color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives shall be normal. Not less than 80 percent, by count, shall be reasonably uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color olives may be present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Grade C. If the ripe olives have a fairly good color, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good color'' has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a fairly uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 60 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent Yellow, and 88 percent Black.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives of fairly good color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Broken pitted. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and may be variable, but is typical of this style prepared from olives of good, reasonably good, or fairly good color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Green-ripe type. The general color impression of the olives shall be normal but may vary markedly for the type. No more than 10 percent, by count, of off-color olives may be present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substandard (SStd.). Canned ripe olives that are abnormal in color for any reason or that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).</p>
