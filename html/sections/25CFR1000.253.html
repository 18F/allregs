                                Sec. 1000.253  When a Tribe withdraws from a Consortium, is the Secretary with a construction project if the withdrawing Tribe so requests?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under Sec. 1000.35 of this part, a Tribe may withdraw from a Consortium and request its portion of a construction project's funds. The Secretary may decide not to award these funds if the award will affect the Consortium's ability to complete a non-severable phase of the project within available funding. An example of a non-severable phase of a project would be the construction of a single building serving all members of the Consortium. An example of a severable phase of a project would be the funding for a road in one village where the Consortium would be able to complete the roads in the other villages that were part of the project approved initially in the AFA. The Secretary's decision under this section may be appealed under subpart R of this part.</p>
