As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Means any item of supply that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at 2.101);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products. Per 46 CFR 525.1(c)(2), ``bulk cargo'' means cargo that is loaded and carried in bulk onboard ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having homogenous characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.</p><p class="depth0">Employee assigned to the contract means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly performing work, in the United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at 22.1803. An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a contract if the employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.</p><p class="depth0">Subcontract means any contract, as defined in 2.101, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract.

(1) If the Contractor is not enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of contract award, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Contractor is not enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of contract award, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enroll. Enroll as a Federal Contractor in the E-Verify program within 30 calendar days of contract award;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Verify all new employees. Within 90 calendar days of enrollment in the E-Verify program, begin to use E-Verify to initiate verification of employment eligibility of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Verify employees assigned to the contract. For each employee assigned to the contract, initiate verification within 90 calendar days after date of enrollment or within 30 calendar days of the employee's assignment to the contract, whichever date is later (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Contractor is enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of contract award, the Contractor shall use E-Verify to initiate verification of employment eligibility of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All new employees. (A) Enrolled 90 calendar days or more. The Contractor shall initiate verification of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Enrolled 90 calendar days or more. The Contractor shall initiate verification of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Enrolled less than 90 calendar days. Within 90 calendar days after enrollment as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify, the Contractor shall initiate verification of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employees assigned to the contract. For each employee assigned to the contract, the Contractor shall initiate verification within 90 calendar days after date of contract award or within 30 days after assignment to the contract, whichever date is later (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Contractor is an institution of higher education (as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a)); a State or local government or the government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or a surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant to a performance bond, the

In such case, the Contractor will be referred to a suspension or debarment official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar, the Contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of this clause. If the suspension or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the Contractor, then the Contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Web site. Information on registration for and use of the E-Verify program can be obtained via the Internet at the Department of Homeland Security Web site: http://www.dhs.gov/E-Verify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Individuals previously verified.
