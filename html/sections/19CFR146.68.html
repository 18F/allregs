                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Weekly permit. The port director may allow the person making  entry for merchandise provided for in Sec. 146.63(c) to file an  application for a weekly permit to enter and release merchandise during  a calendar week for exportation, transportation, or transportation and  exportation. The application will be on Customs Form 7512 stating at the  top the words ``Application for Weekly Zone Permit,'' and will be filed  with the port director. The application must be accompanied by a pro  forma invoice or schedule like that required in Sec. 146.63(c)(1). If  actual transfers will exceed the estimate for the week, the person with  the right to make entry shall file a supplemental Customs Form 7512 to  cover the additional merchandise to be transferred from the subzone or  zone site. No merchandise covered by the weekly permit may be  transferred from the zone before approval of the application by the port  director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual entries. After approval of the application for a  weekly permit by the port director, the person making entry will be  authorized to execute individual Customs Forms 7512 for exportation,  transportation, or transportation and exportation of the merchandise  covered by permit. Upon transfer of the merchandise, the operator shall  obtain a receipt from the carrier on Customs Form 7512 to ensure its  assumption of liability under the carrier's or cartman's bond. Customs  will consider the time of entry to be when the removing carrier signs  the receipt for the merchandise. The operator shall give the bonded  carrier a copy of the individual Customs Form 7512, as provided for in  Sec. 18.2(c) of this chapter. The operator also shall ensure that the  port director receives a copy of the Customs Form 7512 by the end of the  next working day after the carrier has receipted for the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement of merchandise entered. The person making entry for  merchandise under an approved weekly permit shall file with the port  director, by the close of business on the second working day of the week  following the week designated on the permit, a statement of the  merchandise entered under that permit. The statement must list each  Customs Form 7512 by its unique I.T. number, and will provide a  reconciliation of the quantities on the weekly permit with the  manifested quantities on the individual Customs Forms 7512 submitted to  Customs, as well as an explanation of any discrepancy.
