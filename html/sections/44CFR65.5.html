                                Sec. 65.5  Revision to special hazard area boundaries with no change
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Data requirements for topographic changes. In many areas of special flood

hazard (excluding V zones and floodways) it may be feasible to elevate areas with engineered earthen fill above the base flood elevation. Scientific and technical information to support a request to gain exclusion from an area of special flood hazard of a structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by the placement of engineered earthen fill will include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the recorded deed indicating the legal description of the property and the official recordation information (deed book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official (e.g., County Clerk or Recorder of Deeds).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the property is recorded on a plat map, a copy of the recorded plat indicating both the location of the property and the official recordation information (plat book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official. If the property is not recorded on a plat map, FEMA requires copies of the tax map or other suitable maps to help in locating the property accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A topographic map or other information indicating existing ground elevations and the date of fill. FEMA's determination to exclude a legally defined parcel of land or a structure from the area of special flood hazard will be based upon a comparison of the base flood elevations to the lowest ground elevation of the parcel or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. If the lowest ground elevation of the entire legally defined parcel of land or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure are at or above the elevations of the base flood, FEMA will exclude the parcel and/or structure from the area of special flood hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Written assurance by the participating community that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under Sec. 60.3. This includes the requirements that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Existing residential structures built in the SFHA have their lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The participating community has determined that the land and any existing or proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are ``reasonably safe from flooding'', and that they have on file, available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used to make that determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The participating community has issued permits for all existing and proposed construction or other development; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies where approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under Sec. 60.3, of this chapter, the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are ``reasonably safe from flooding,'' we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth in Sec. 65.5(a). The community must maintain on file, and make available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used in determining that the land or structures are ``reasonably safe from flooding.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Data to substantiate the base flood elevation. If we complete a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), we will use those data to substantiate the base flood elevation. Otherwise, the community may submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service, State and local water resource departments, or technical data prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer. If base flood elevations have not previously been established, we may also request hydrologic and hydraulic calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A revision of floodplain delineations based on fill must demonstrate that any such fill does not result in a floodway encroachment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New topographic data. A community may also follow the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6)

of this section to request a map revision when no physical changes have occurred in the area of special flood hazard, when no fill has been placed, and when the natural ground elevations are at or above the elevations of the base flood, where new topographic maps are more detailed or more accurate than the current map.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification requirements. A registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor must certify the items required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) and (b) of this section. Such certifications are subject to the provisions under Sec. 65.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission procedures. Submit all requests to the appropriate address serving the community's geographic area or to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC.
