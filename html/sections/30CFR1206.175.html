You must calculate the portion of net plant output of residue gas and gas plant products attributable to each lease as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First, compute the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products attributable to the lease by multiplying the lease volume of the gas stream by the tested residue gas content (mole percentage) or gas plant product (GPM) content of the gas stream;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second, calculate the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products delivered from all leases by summing the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products delivered from each lease; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third, calculate the theoretical quantities of net plant output of residue gas and of gas plant products attributable to each lease by multiplying the net plant output of residue gas, or gas plant products, by the ratio in which the theoretical volumes of residue gas, or gas plant products, is the numerator and the theoretical volume of residue gas, or gas plant products, delivered from all leases is the denominator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may request ONRR approval of other methods for determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease. If ONRR approves a different method, it will be applicable to all gas production from your Indian leases that is processed in the same plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not take any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas incurred prior to the facility measurement point will not be subject to royalty if BLM determines that the loss was unavoidable.</p>
