                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criminal Law Enforcement. (1) Exemption. Under the authority  granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of  records entitled ``PBGC-17, Office of Inspector General Investigative  File System--PBGC'' from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (c)(4),  (d)(1) through (4), (e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5),  (e)(8), (f), and (g) because the system contains information pertaining  to the enforcement of criminal laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for exemption. The reasons for asserting this exemption  are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure to the individual named in the record pursuant to  subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1) through (4) could seriously impede  or compromise the investigation by alerting the target(s), subjecting a  potential witness or witnesses to intimidation or improper influence,  and leading to destruction of evidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application of subsection (e)(1) is impractical because the  relevance of specific information might be established only after  considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. Effective law  enforcement requires the Office of Inspector General to keep information  that may not be relevant to a specific Office of Inspector General  investigation, but which may provide leads for appropriate law  enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to  the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General and/or other  agencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Application of subsection (e)(2) would be counterproductive to  performance of a criminal investigation because it would alert the  individual to the existence of an investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Application of subsection (e)(3) could discourage the free flow  of information in a criminal law enforcement inquiry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do  not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of  subsection (d). Nevertheless, PBGC has published notice of its  notification, access, and contest procedures because access is  appropriate in some cases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Although the Office of Inspector General endeavors to maintain  accurate records, application of subsection (e)(5) is impractical  because maintaining only those records that are accurate, relevant,  timely, and complete and that assure fairness in determination is  contrary to established investigative techniques. Information that may  initially appear inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete may,  when collated and analyzed with other available information, become more  pertinent as an investigation progresses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an  ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply to this system  if an exemption otherwise applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other Law Enforcement. (1) Exemption. Under the authority  granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of  records entitled ``PBGC-17, Office of Inspector General Investigative  File System--PBGC'' from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)  through (4), (e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as  stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that is, because the system  contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes  other than material within the scope of subsection 552a(j)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for exemption. The reasons for asserting this exemption  are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act  could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of the Office  of Inspector General operations. Disclosure could invade the privacy of  other individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly  promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity  of information which would otherwise be subject to privileges (see,  e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)), and which could interfere with other  important law enforcement concerns (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em>, (d)(1) through (4), (e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f)  because the system contains investigatory material compiled for the  purpose of determining eligibility or qualifications for federal  civilian or contract employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reason for exemption. The reason for asserting this exemption is  to protect from disclosure the identity of a confidential source when an  express promise of confidentiality has been given to obtain information  from sources who would otherwise be unwilling to provide necessary  information.
