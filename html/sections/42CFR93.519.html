                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ALJ decides the admissibility of evidence offered at the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in this part, the ALJ is not bound by the  Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). However, the ALJ may apply the FRE  where appropriate (e.g., to exclude unreliable evidence).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ALJ must admit evidence unless it is clearly irrelevant,  immaterial, or unduly repetitious. However, the ALJ may exclude relevant  and material evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed  by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by  considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative  evidence under FRE 401-403.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ALJ must exclude relevant and material evidence if it is  privileged, including but not limited to evidence protected by the  attorney-client privilege, the attorney-work product doctrine, or  Federal law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The ALJ may take judicial notice of matters upon the ALJ's own  initiative or upon motion by a party as permitted under FRE 201  (Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ALJ may take judicial notice of any other matter of  technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ALJ must give the parties adequate notice of matters subject  to judicial notice and adequate opportunity to show that the ALJ  erroneously noticed the matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts other than those at issue in  the hearing is admissible only as permitted under FRE 404(b) (Character  Evidence not Admissible to Prove Conduct; Exceptions, Other Crimes).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Methods of proving character are admissible only as permitted  under FRE 405 (Methods of Proving Character).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Evidence related to the character and conduct of witnesses is  admissible only as permitted under FRE Rule 608 (Evidence of Character  and Conduct of Witness).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Evidence about offers of compromise or settlement made in this  action is inadmissible as provided in FRE 408 (Compromise and Offers to  Compromise).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The ALJ must admit relevant and material hearsay evidence,  unless an objecting party shows that the offered hearsay evidence is not  reliable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The parties may introduce witnesses and evidence on rebuttal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> All documents and other evidence offered or admitted into the  record must be open to examination by both parties, unless otherwise  ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Whenever the ALJ excludes evidence, the party offering the  evidence may make an offer of proof, and the ALJ must include the offer  in the transcript or recording of the hearing in full. The offer of  proof should consist of a brief oral statement describing the evidence  excluded. If the offered evidence consists of an exhibit, the ALJ must  mark it for identification and place it in the hearing record. However,  the ALJ may rely upon the offered evidence in reaching the decision on  the case only if the ALJ admits it.</p>
