                            <p class="depth0">The following general information must accompany your EP:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications and permits. A listing, including filing or  approval status, of the Federal, State, and local application approvals  or permits you must obtain to conduct your proposed exploration  activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drilling fluids. A table showing the projected amount, discharge  rate, and chemical constituents for each type (i.e., water-based, oil- based, synthetic-based) of drilling fluid you plan to use to drill your  proposed exploration wells.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Chemical products. A table showing the name and brief  description, quantities to be stored, storage method, and rates of usage  of the chemical products you will use to conduct your proposed  exploration activities. List only those chemical products you will store  or use in quantities greater than the amounts defined as Reportable  Quantities in 40 CFR part 302, or amounts specified by the Regional  Supervisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New or unusual technology. A description and discussion of any  new or unusual technology (see definition under Sec.  550.200) you will  use to carry out your proposed exploration activities. In the public  information copies of your EP, you may exclude any proprietary  information from this description. In that case, include a brief  discussion of the general subject matter   of the omitted information. If you will not use any new or unusual  technology to carry out your proposed exploration activities, include a  statement so indicating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bonds, oil spill financial responsibility, and well control  statements. Statements attesting that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The activities and facilities proposed in your EP are or will be  covered by an appropriate bond under 30 CFR part 556, subpart I;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You have demonstrated or will demonstrate oil spill financial  responsibility for facilities proposed in your EP according to 30 CFR  part 553; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You have or will have the financial capability to drill a relief  well and conduct other emergency well control operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Suspensions of operations.

A scenario for the potential blowout of the  proposed well in your EP that you expect will have the highest volume of  liquid hydrocarbons. Include the estimated flow rate, total volume, and  maximum duration of the potential blowout. Also, discuss the potential  for the well to bridge over, the likelihood for surface intervention to  stop the blowout, the availability of a rig to drill a relief well, and  rig package constraints. Estimate the time it would take to drill a  relief well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contact. The name, address (e-mail address, if available), and  telephone number of the person with whom the Regional Supervisor and any  affected State(s) can communicate about your EP.</p>
