                                Sec. 1.408-8  Distribution requirements for individual retirement
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to the distribution rules  for IRAs provided in sections 408(a)(6) and 408(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1. Is an IRA subject to the distribution rules provided in section  401(a)(9) for qualified plans?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. (a) Yes, an IRA is subject to the required minimum distribution  rules provided in section 401(a)(9). In order to satisfy section  401(a)(9) for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for  calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, the rules of  Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-9 and 1.401(a)(9)-6 for  defined contribution plans must be applied, except as otherwise provided  in this section. For example, whether the 5-year rule or the life  expectancy rule applies to distributions after death occurring before  the IRA owner's required beginning date is determined in accordance with  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 and the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-4 apply for  purposes of determining an IRA owner's designated beneficiary.  Similarly, the amount of the minimum distribution required for each  calendar year from an individual account is determined in accordance  with Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5. For purposes of this section, the term IRA  means an individual retirement account or annuity described in section  408(a) or (b). The IRA owner is the individual for whom an IRA is  originally established by contributions for the benefit of that  individual and that individual's beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of applying the required minimum distribution rules  in Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-9 and 1.401(a)(9)-6 for  qualified plans, the IRA trustee, custodian, or issuer is treated as the  plan administrator, and the IRA owner is substituted for the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> See A-14 and A-15 of Sec. 1.408A-6 for rules under section  401(a)(9) that apply to a Roth IRA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. Are IRAs that receive employer contributions under a simplified  employee pension (defined in section 408(k)) or a SIMPLE IRA (defined in  section 408(p)) treated as IRAs for purposes of section 401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. Yes, IRAs that receive employer contributions under a  simplified employee pension (defined in section 408(k)) or a SIMPLE plan  (defined in section 408(p)) are treated as IRAs, rather than employer  plans, for purposes of section 401(a)(9) and are, therefore, subject to  the distribution rules in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. In the case of distributions from an IRA, what does the term  required beginning date mean?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. In the case of distributions from an IRA, the term required  beginning date means April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar  year in which the individual attains age 70\1/2\.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. What portion of a distribution from an IRA is not eligible for  rollover because the amount is a required minimum distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. The portion of a distribution that is a required minimum  distribution from an IRA and thus not eligible for rollover is  determined in the same manner as provided in A-7 of Sec. 1.402(c)-2 for  distributions from qualified plans. For example, if a minimum  distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) for a calendar year, an  amount distributed during a calendar year from an IRA is treated as a  required minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9) to the extent that  the total required minimum distribution for the year under section  401(a)(9) for that IRA has not been satisfied. This requirement may be  satisfied by a distribution from the IRA or, as permitted under A-9 of  this section, from another IRA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. May an individual's surviving spouse elect to treat such  spouse's entire interest as a beneficiary in an individual's IRA upon  the death of the individual (or the remaining part of such interest if  distribution to the spouse has commenced) as the spouse's own account?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. (a) The surviving spouse of an individual may elect, in the  manner described in paragraph (b) of this A-5, to treat the spouse's  entire interest as a beneficiary in an individual's IRA (or the  remaining part of such interest if distribution thereof has commenced to  the spouse) as the spouse's own IRA. This election is permitted to be  made at any time after the individual's date of death. In order to make  this election, the spouse must be the sole beneficiary of the IRA and  have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from the IRA. If a trust is  named as beneficiary of the IRA, this requirement is not satisfied even  if the spouse is the sole beneficiary of the trust. If the surviving  spouse makes the election, the required minimum distribution for the  calendar year of the election and each subsequent calendar year is  determined under section 401(a)(9)(A) with the spouse as IRA owner and  not section 401(a)(9)(B) with the surviving spouse as the deceased IRA  owner's beneficiary. However, if the election is made in the calendar  year containing the IRA owner's death, the spouse is not required to  take a required minimum distribution as the IRA owner for that calendar  year. Instead, the spouse is required to take a required minimum  distribution for that year, determined with respect to the deceased IRA  owner under the rules of A-4(a) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5, to the extent  such a distribution was not made to the IRA owner before death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The election described in paragraph (a) of this A-5 is made by  the surviving spouse redesignating the account as an account in the name  of the surviving spouse as IRA owner rather than as beneficiary.  Alternatively, a surviving spouse eligible to make the election is  deemed to have made the election if, at any time, either of the  following occurs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any amount in the IRA that would be required to be distributed  to the surviving spouse as beneficiary under section 401(a)(9)(B) is not  distributed within the time period required under section 401(a)(9)(B);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any additional amount is contributed to the IRA which is  subject, or deemed to be subject, to the lifetime distribution  requirements of section 401(a)(9)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The result of an election described in paragraph (b) of this A-5  is that the surviving spouse shall then be considered the IRA owner for  whose benefit the trust is maintained for all purposes under the  Internal Revenue Code (e.g., section 72(t)).</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. How is the benefit determined for purposes of calculating the  required minimum distribution from an IRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. For purposes of determining the minimum distribution required  to be made from an IRA in any calendar year, the account balance of the  IRA as of December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the  calendar year for which distributions are required to be made is  substituted in A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for the account balance of the  employee. Except as provided in A-7 and A-8 of this section, no  adjustments are made for contributions or distributions after that date.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. What rules apply in the case of a rollover to an IRA of an  amount distributed by a qualified plan or another IRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-7. If the surviving spouse of an employee rolls over a  distribution from a qualified plan, such surviving spouse may elect to  treat the IRA as the   spouse's own IRA in accordance with the provisions in A-5 of this  section. In the event of any other rollover to an IRA of an amount  distributed by a qualified plan or another IRA, the rules in Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-7 will apply for purposes of determining the account balance  for the receiving IRA and the required minimum distribution from the  receiving IRA. However, because the value of the account balance is  determined as of December 31 of the year preceding the year for which  the required minimum distribution is being determined and not as of a  valuation date in the preceding year, the account balance of the  receiving IRA is only adjusted if the amount is not received in the  calendar year in which the amount rolled over is distributed. In that  case, for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution for  the calendar year in which such amount is actually received, the account  balance of the receiving IRA as of December 31 of the preceding year  must be adjusted by the amount received in accordance with A-2 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-7.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. What rules apply in the case of a transfer (including a  recharacterization) from one IRA to another?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. (a) General rule. In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer  from one IRA to another IRA that is not a distribution and rollover, the  transfer is not treated as a distribution by the transferor IRA for  purposes of section 401(a)(9). Accordingly, the minimum distribution  requirement with respect to the transferor IRA must still be satisfied.  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this A-8 for recharacterizations,  after the transfer the employee's account balance and the required  minimum distribution under the transferee IRA are determined in the same  manner as an account balance and required minimum distribution are  determined under an IRA receiving a rollover contribution under A-7 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Recharacterizations. If an amount is contributed to a Roth IRA  that is a conversion contribution or failed conversion contribution and  that amount (plus net income allocable to that amount) is transferred to  another IRA (transferee IRA) in a subsequent year as a recharacterized  contribution, the recharacterized contribution (plus allocable net  income) must be added to the December 31 account balance of the  transferee IRA for the year in which the conversion or failed conversion  occurred.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9. Is the required minimum distribution from one IRA of an owner  permitted to be distributed from another IRA in order to satisfy section  401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-9. Yes, the required minimum distribution must be calculated  separately for each IRA. The separately calculated amounts may then be  totaled and the total distribution taken from any one or more of the  individual's IRAs under the rules set forth in this A-9. Generally, only  amounts in IRAs that an individual holds as the IRA owner may be  aggregated. However, amounts in IRAs that an individual holds as a  beneficiary of the same decedent and which are being distributed under  the life expectancy rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) or (iv) may be  aggregated, but such amounts may not be aggregated with amounts held in  IRAs that the individual holds as the IRA owner or as the beneficiary of  another decedent. Distributions from section 403(b) contracts or  accounts will not satisfy the distribution requirements from IRAs, nor  will distributions from IRAs satisfy the distribution requirements from  section 403(b) contracts or accounts. Distributions from Roth IRAs  (defined in section 408A) will not satisfy the distribution requirements  applicable to IRAs or section 403(b) accounts or contracts and  distributions from IRAs or section 403(b) contracts or accounts will not  satisfy the distribution requirements from Roth IRAs.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10. Is any reporting required by the trustee, custodian, or issuer  of an IRA with respect to the minimum amount that is required to be  distributed from that IRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-10. Yes, the trustee, custodian, or issuer of an IRA is required  to report information with respect to the minimum amount required to be  distributed from the IRA for each calendar year to individuals or  entities, at the time, and in the manner, prescribed by the Commissioner  in revenue rulings, notices, and other guidance published in the  Internal Revenue Bulletin (see   Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) as well as the applicable  Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11. Which amounts distributed from an IRA are taken into account  in determining whether section 401(a)(9) is satisfied?</p><p class="depth0">A-11. (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  A-11, all amounts distributed from an IRA are taken into account in  determining whether section 401(a)(9) is satisfied, regardless of  whether the amount is includible in income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts not taken into account. The following amounts are not  taken into account in determining whether the required minimum amount  with respect to an IRA for a calendar year has been distributed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contributions returned pursuant to section 408(d)(4), together  with the income allocable to these contributions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contributions returned pursuant to section 408(d)(5);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corrective distributions of excess simplified employee pension  contributions under section 408(k)(6)(C), together with the income  allocable to these distributions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Similar items designated by the Commissioner in revenue rulings,  notices, and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.  See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12. How does the special rule in A-3(d) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for  a qualifying longevity annuity contract (QLAC) apply to an IRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-12. (a) General rule. The special rule in A-3(d) of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5 for a QLAC, defined in A-17 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6,  applies to an IRA, subject to the exceptions set forth in this A-12. See  A-14(d) of Sec. 1.408A-6 for special rules relating to Roth IRAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on premiums--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In lieu of the  limitations described in A-17(b) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6, the premiums  paid with respect to the contract on a date are not permitted to exceed  the lesser of the dollar limitation in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-12 or  the percentage limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this A-12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dollar limitation. The dollar limitation is an amount equal to  the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $125,000 (as adjusted under A-17(d)(2) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6),  over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The premiums paid before that date with respect to the contract,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The premiums paid on or before that date with respect to any  other contract that is intended to be a QLAC and that is purchased for  the IRA owner under the IRA, or any other plan, annuity, or account  described in section 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), or 408 or eligible  governmental plan under section 457(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Percentage limitation. The percentage limitation is an amount  equal to the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 25 percent of the total account balances of the IRAs (other than  Roth IRAs) that an individual holds as the IRA owner (including the  value of any QLAC held under those IRAs) as of December 31 of the  calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a premium  is paid, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The premiums paid before that date with respect to the contract,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The premiums paid on or before that date with respect to any  other contract that is intended to be a QLAC and that is held or was  purchased for the individual under those IRAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reliance on representations. For purposes of the limitations  described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this A-12, unless the trustee,  custodian, or issuer of an IRA has actual knowledge to the contrary, the  trustee, custodian, or issuer may rely on the IRA owner's representation  (made in writing or such other form as may be prescribed by the  Commissioner) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the premiums described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B)  and (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this A-12 that are not paid under the IRA, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the account balances described in paragraph  (b)(3)(i) of this A-12 (other than the account balance under the IRA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Permitted delay in setting beneficiary designation. In case of a  contract that is rolled over from a plan to an IRA before the required  beginning date under the plan, the contract will not violate the rule in  A-17(c)(2)(v) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6 that a non-spouse beneficiary must  be irrevocably selected on   or before the later of the date of purchase or the required beginning  date under the IRA, provided that the contract requires a beneficiary to  be irrevocably selected by the end of the year following the year of the  rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Roth IRAs. A contract that is purchased under a Roth IRA is not  treated as a contract that is intended to be a QLAC for purposes of  applying the dollar and percentage limitation rules in paragraphs  (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this A-12. See A-14(d) of Sec.  1.408A-6. If a QLAC is purchased or held under a plan, annuity, account,  or traditional IRA, and that contract is later rolled over or converted  to a Roth IRA, the contract is not treated as a contract that is  intended to be a QLAC after the date of the rollover or conversion.  Thus, premiums paid with respect to the contract will not be taken into  account under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) or paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this  A-12 after the date of the rollover or conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This A-12 applies to contracts  purchased on or after July 2, 2014.
