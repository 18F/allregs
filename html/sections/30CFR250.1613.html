                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When drilling a conductor or cap rock hole, all drilling units  shall be equipped with a diverter system consisting of a diverter  sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems. The diverter  system shall be designed, installed, and maintained so as to divert  gases, water, mud, and other materials away from the facilities and  personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The diverter system shall be equipped with remote-control valves  in the flow lines that can be operated from at least one remote-control  station in addition to the one on the drilling floor. Any valve used in  a diverter system shall be full opening. No manual or butterfly valves  shall be installed in any part of a diverter system. There shall be a  minimum number of turns in the vent line(s) downstream of the spool  outlet flange, and the radius of curvature of turns shall be as large as  practicable. Flexible hose may be used for diversion lines instead of  rigid pipe if the flexible hose has integral end couplings. The entire  diverter system shall be firmly anchored and supported to prevent  whipping and vibrations. All diverter control equipment and lines shall  be protected from physical damage from thrown and falling objects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For drilling operations conducted with a surface wellhead  configuration, the following shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the diverter system utilizes only one spool outlet, branch  lines shall be installed to provide downwind diversion capability, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No spool outlet or diverter line internal diameter shall be less  than 10 inches, except that dual spool outlets are acceptable if each  outlet has a minimum internal diameter of 8 inches, and both outlets are  piped to overboard lines and that each line downstream of the changeover  nipple at the spool has a minimum internal diameter of 10 inches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The diverter sealing element and diverter valves shall be  pressure tested to a minimum of 200 psi when nippled upon conductor  casing. No more than 7 days shall elapse between subsequent pressure  tests. The diverter sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter  control systems (including the remote)   shall be actuation tested, and the diverter lines shall be tested for  flow prior to spudding and thereafter at least once each 24-hour period  alternating between control stations. All test times and results shall  be recorded in the driller's report.</p>
