                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grading, drainage, and associated items of site preparation are  eligible for inclusion in a project, but only with respect to one  landing strip at any airport, unless the airport qualifies for more than  one runway, based on traffic volume or wind conditions (as outlined in  Sec. 151.77) and the overall site preparation required for development  in accordance with the airport layout plan. The complete clearance of  runway clear zone areas is desirable, but, as a minimum, all  obstructions as determined by Sec. 77.23 as applied to Sec. 77.27 (b)  and (c) of this chapter must be removed. Grading in runway clear zones  is eligible only to remove terrain that is an obstruction. The clear  zone is not a graded overrun area. Specific site preparation for an  airport terminal building is eligible on the same basis as the building  itself. The site preparation cost is prorated based on eligible and  ineligible building space. Appendix B of this part sets forth typical  eligible and ineligible items of site preparation as covered by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of this section, eligible drainage work off the  airport site includes drainage outfalls, drainage disposal, and  interception ditches. If there is damage to adjacent property, its  correction is an eligible item for inclusion in the project.  [Doc.
