                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NOAA may audit hydrographic products it has certified. NOAA may   conduct audits without advance notification. However, visits to  companies' facilities will be scheduled. Audits may include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The producing companies as it may affect the certified product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certified products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Processes used in making, distributing, and marketing certified  products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of the NOAA emblem;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examination of manufacturers' public claims about certified  hydrographic products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other relevant criteria as they become apparent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NOAA may decertify a hydrographic product based on the findings  of an audit. In general, a hydrographic product may be decertified if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The results of an audit indicate that the product no longer  meets the standards under which it was certified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The product has been substantively changed from the product that  was tested and certified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implied or actual claims about the product, and/or other data or  products linked to the product, are judged by NOAA to be untrue or  misleading;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The NOAA emblem was improperly or inappropriately displayed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other relevant reasons as they become apparent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A producing company may decline to reveal information during an  audit that it declares to be proprietary or for other reasons. In this  eventuality, NOAA reserves the right to decertify based on lack of  information should it deem that action appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The entity producing the certified hydrographic product shall be  notified in writing of NOAA's intent to decertify that product. Said  entity shall have 30 days to request reconsideration of that intended  action in writing to the Quality Assurance Program address. Said request  shall contain the identification of the hydrographic product, the  requestor, and sufficient information for NOAA to make a determination  on the request for reconsideration. Alternatively, the entity may  correct the deficiencies cited by NOAA within 30 days, notify NOAA in  writing at the Quality Assurance Program address of the corrective  action taken, and provide sufficient evidence for NOAA to judge the  correctness and effectiveness of the corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a request for reconsideration is submitted, or if the  producing entity asserts that the deficiencies have been corrected, NOAA  shall have 60 calendar days, if its other obligations permit, to  consider the request for reconsideration or the corrective action, at  which time NOAA shall issue its decertification decision. The decision  and NOAA's reason for its action shall be made public in the Federal  Register or by other appropriate means, and the producing entity shall  be notified in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NOAA's decertification, if unappealed or uncorrected within 30  days, shall be considered final. NOAA shall notify the producing entity  of this action in writing, and announce the decertification in the  Federal Register or by other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Upon decertification, manufacturers shall discontinue all claims  of certification, and shall discontinue use of the NOAA emblem.</p>
