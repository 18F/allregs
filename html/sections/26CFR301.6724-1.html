                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Waiver of the penalty--(1) General rule. The penalty for a failure relating to an information reporting requirement (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) is waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The penalty for a failure relating to an information reporting requirement (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) is waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable cause defined. The penalty is waived for reasonable cause only if the filer establishes that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are significant mitigating factors with respect to the failure, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The failure arose from events beyond the filer's control (``impediment''), as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Moreover, the filer must establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, both before and after the failure occurred. Thus, if the filer establishes that there are significant mitigating factors for a failure but is unable to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, the mitigating factors will not be sufficient to obtain a waiver of the penalty. Similarly, if the filer establishes that a failure arose from an impediment but is unable to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, the impediment will not be sufficient to obtain a waiver of the penalty. See paragraph (g) of this section for the reasonable cause safe harbor for persons who exercise due diligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Significant mitigating factors. In order to establish reasonable cause under this paragraph (b), the filer must satisfy paragraph (d) of this section and must show that there are significant mitigating factors for the failure. The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fact that prior to the failure the filer was never required to file the particular type of return or furnish the particular type of statement with respect to which the failure occurred, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fact that the filer has an established history of complying with the information reporting requirement with respect to which the failure occurred. In determining whether the filer has such an established history, significant consideration is given to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the filer has incurred any penalty under Sec. Sec. 301.6721-1, 301.6722-1, or 301.6723-1 in prior years for the failure (or under parallel provisions of prior law), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the filer has incurred any such penalty in prior years, the extent of the filer's success in lessening its error rate from year to year.</p><p class="depth0">A filer may treat as a penalty not incurred any penalty under sections 6721 through 6723 that was self-assessed under section 6724(c)(3) and any penalty under section 6676(b) that was self-assessed under section 6676(d), prior to amendment or repeal by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the application of this paragraph (b) to failures attributable to the actions of a filer's agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Events beyond the filer's control--(1) In general. In order to establish reasonable cause under this paragraph (c)(1), the filer must satisfy paragraph (d) of this section and must show that the failure was due to events beyond the filer's control. Events which are generally considered beyond the filer's control include but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In order to establish reasonable cause under this paragraph (c)(1), the filer must satisfy paragraph (d) of this section and must show that the failure was due to events beyond the filer's control. Events which are generally considered beyond the filer's control include but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unavailability of the relevant business records (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An undue economic hardship relating to filing on magnetic media (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain actions of the Internal Revenue Service (as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain actions of an agent (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain actions of the payee or any other person providing necessary information with respect to the return or payee statement (as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unavailability of the relevant business records. In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to the unavailability of the relevant business records, the filer's business records must have been unavailable under such conditions, in such manner, and for such period as to prevent timely compliance (ordinarily at least a 2-week period prior to the due date (with regard to extensions) of the required return or the required date (with regard to extensions) for furnishing the payee statement), and the unavailability must have been caused by a supervening event. A ``supervening event'' includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fire or other casualty that damages or impairs the filer's relevant business records or the filer's system for processing and filing such records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statutory or regulatory change that has a direct impact upon data processing and that is made so close to the time that the return or payee statement is required that, for all practical purposes, the change cannot be complied with; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for filing a return or furnishing a payee statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Undue economic hardship relating to filing on magnetic media. In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to an undue economic hardship for filing on magnetic media, the filer must show that it failed to file on magnetic media because the filer lacked the necessary hardware. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the filer will not be considered to have acted in a responsible manner under paragraph (d) of this section unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The filer attempted on a timely basis to contract out the magnetic media filing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of filing on magnetic media was prohibitive as determined at least 45 days before the due date of the returns (without regard to extensions) (90 days for information returns the due date for which (without regard to extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and by or before February 28, 1991 (March 15, 1991, for Forms 1042S));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost was supported by a minimum of two cost estimates from unrelated parties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The filer filed the returns on paper. Reasonable cause will not ordinarily be established under this paragraph (c)(3) if a filer received a reasonable cause waiver in any prior year under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to an undue economic hardship relating to filing on magnetic media.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Actions of the Internal Revenue Service. In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to certain actions of the Internal Revenue Service, a filer must show that the failure was due to the filer's reasonable reliance on erroneous written information from the Internal Revenue Service. Reasonable reliance means that the filer relied in good faith on the information. The filer shall not be considered to have relied in good faith if the Internal Revenue Service was not aware of all the facts when it provided the information to the filer. In order to substantiate reasonable cause under this paragraph (c)(4), the filer must provide a copy of the written information provided by the Internal Revenue Service and, if applicable, the filer's written request for the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Actions of agent--imputed reasonable cause. In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to actions of an agent, the filer must show the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The filer exercised reasonable business judgment in contracting with the agent to file timely correct returns or furnish timely correct payee statements with respect to which the failure occurred. This includes contracting with the agent and providing the proper information sufficiently in advance of the due date of the return or statement to permit timely filing of correct returns or timely furnishing of correct payee statements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The agent satisfied the reasonable cause criteria set forth in paragraph (b) or one of the reasonable cause criteria set forth in paragraph (c) (2) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Actions of the payee or any other person. In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to the actions of the payee or any other person, such as a broker as defined in section 6045(c) providing information with respect to the return or payee statement, the filer must show either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That the failure resulted from the failure of the payee, or any other person required to provide information necessary for the filer to comply with the information reporting requirements (``any other person''), to provide information to the filer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the failure resulted from incorrect information provided by the payee (or any other person) upon which information the filer relied in good faith. To substantiate reasonable cause under this paragraph (c)(6), the filer must provide documentary evidence upon request of the Internal Revenue Service showing that the failure was attributable to the payee (or any other person). See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for special rules relating to the availability of a waiver where the filer's failure relates to a taxpayer identification number (TIN), and the failure is attributable to actions of the payee described in paragraph (c)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Responsible manner--(1) In general. Acting in a responsible manner means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Acting in a responsible manner means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That the filer exercised reasonable care, which is that standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would use under the circumstances in the course of its business in determining its filing obligations and in handling account information such as account numbers and balances, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the filer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, including, where applicable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requesting appropriate extensions of time to file, when practicable, in order to avoid the failure,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Attempting to prevent an impediment or a failure, if it was foreseeable,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Acting to remove an impediment or the cause of a failure, once it occurred, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Rectifying the failure as promptly as possible once the impediment was removed or the failure was discovered. Ordinarily, a rectification is considered prompt if it is made within 30 days after the date the impediment is removed or the failure is discovered or on the earliest date thereafter on which a regular submission of corrections is made. Submissions will be considered regular only if made at intervals of 30 days or less. A failure may be rectified by filing or correcting the information return, furnishing or correcting the payee statement, or by providing or correcting the information to satisfy the specified information reporting requirement with respect to which the failure occurs. Paragraph (d)(ii)(D) of this section does not apply with respect to information the filer is prohibited from altering under specific information reporting rules. See Sec. 1.6045-4(i)(5) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for filers seeking a waiver pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section. A filer seeking a waiver for reasonable cause pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section with respect to a failure resulting from a missing or an incorrect TIN will be deemed to have acted in a responsible manner in compliance with this paragraph (d) only if the filer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section (relating to missing TINs) or paragraph (f) of this section (relating to incorrect TINs), whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acting in a responsible manner--special rules for missing TINs--(1) In general. A filer that is seeking a waiver for reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(6) of this section will satisfy paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to establishing that a failure to include a TIN or an information return resulted from the failure of the payee to provide information to the filer (i.e., a missing TIN) only if the filer makes the initial and, if required, the annual solicitations described in this paragraph (e) (required solicitations). For purposes of this section, a number is treated as a ``missing TIN'' if the number does not contain nine digits or includes one or more alpha characters (a character or symbol other than an Arabic numeral) as one of the nine digits. A solicitation means a request by the filer for the payee to furnish a correct TIN. See paragraph (f) of this section for the rules that a filer must follow to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner with respect to providing incorrect TINs on information returns. See paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(A) of this section for alternative solicitation requirements. See paragraph (g) of this section for the safe harbor due diligence rules. See paragraph (h) of this section for the rule applicable to failures with respect to information returns the due date for which (without regard to extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and on or before April 22, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A filer that is seeking a waiver for reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(6) of this section will satisfy paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to establishing that a failure to include a TIN or an information return resulted from the failure of the payee to provide information to the filer (i.e., a missing TIN) only if the filer makes the initial and, if required, the annual solicitations described in this paragraph (e) (required solicitations). For purposes of this section, a number is treated as a ``missing TIN'' if the number does not contain nine digits or includes one or more alpha characters (a character or symbol other than an Arabic numeral) as one of the nine digits.

See paragraph (h) of this section for the rule applicable to failures with respect to information returns the due date for which (without regard to extensions) is after December 31, 1989, and on or before April 22, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial solicitation. An initial solicitation for a payee's correct TIN must be made at the time an account is opened. The term ``account'' includes accounts, relationships, and other transactions. However, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph (e)(1)(i) with respect to a new account if the filer has the payee's TIN and uses that TIN for all accounts of the payee. For example, see Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter. Further, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph (e)(1)(i) with respect to accounts for which the filer filed an information return subject to paragraph (h) of this section. For purposes of this section, the initial solicitation requirement is deemed to have been met with respect to accounts opened after December 31, 1989, and on or before April 22, 1991. If the account is opened in person, the initial solicitation may be made by oral or written request, such as on an account creation document. If the account is opened by mail, telephone, or other electronic means, the TIN may be requested through such communications. If the account is opened by the payee's completing and mailing an application furnished by the filer that requests the payee's TIN, the initial solicitation requirement is considered met. If a TIN is not received as a result of an initial solicitation, the filer may be required to make additional solicitations (``annual solicitations'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> First annual solicitation. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section, a filer must undertake an annual solicitation if a TIN is not received as a result of an initial solicitation (or if the filer was not required to make an initial solicitation under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and the filer has not received a payee's TIN). The first annual solicitation must be made on or before December 31 of the year in which the account is opened (for accounts opened before December) or January 31 of the following year (for accounts opened in the preceding December) (``annual solicitation period'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Second annual solicitation. If the TIN is not received as a result of the first annual solicitation, the filer must undertake a second annual solicitation. The second annual solicitation must be made after the expiration of the annual solicitation period and on or before December 31 of the year immediately succeeding the calendar year in which the account is opened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional requirements. After receiving a TIN, a filer must include that TIN on any information returns the original due date of which (with regard to extensions) is after the date that the filer receives the TIN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Failures to which a solicitation relates. The initial and first annual solicitations relate to failures on returns filed for the year in which an account is opened. The second annual solicitation relates to failures on returns filed for the year immediately following the year in which an account is opened and for succeeding calendar years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Exceptions and limitations. (A) The solicitation requirements under this paragraph (e) do not apply to the extent an information reporting provision under which a return, as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1, is filed provides specific requirements relating to the manner or the time period in which a TIN must be solicited. In that event, the requirements of this paragraph (e) will be satisfied only if the filer complies with the manner and time period requirements of the specific information reporting provision and the provisions of this paragraph (e) to the extent applicable. Also, see section 3406(e) which provides rules on the manner and time period in which a TIN must be provided for certain accounts with respect to interest, dividends, patronage dividends, and amounts subject to broker reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The solicitation requirements under this paragraph (e) do not apply to the extent an information reporting provision under which a return, as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1, is filed provides specific requirements relating to the manner or the time period in which a TIN must be solicited. In that event, the requirements of this paragraph (e) will be satisfied only if the filer complies with the manner and time period requirements of the specific information reporting provision and the provisions of this paragraph (e) to the extent applicable. Also, see section 3406(e) which provides rules on the manner and time period in which a TIN must be provided for certain accounts with respect to interest, dividends, patronage dividends, and amounts subject to broker reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An annual solicitation is not required to be made for a year under this paragraph (e) with respect to an account if no payments are made to the account for such year or if no return as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6721-1 is required to be filed for the account for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a filer fails to make one (or more) of the required solicitations under paragraphs (e)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the filer may satisfy the requirements of this section by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Making two consecutive annual solicitations in subsequent years (``make-up solicitations''), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Satisfying paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a filer who has made none of the required solicitations may satisfy the requirements of this section by making two consecutive solicitations. In determining whether a filer has made two consecutive solicitations, years to which paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(B) of this section applies shall be disregarded. If a filer fails to make the initial solicitation under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the make-up solicitations described in this paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(C) may be made in the years in which the first and second annual solicitations are required to be made; however, the penalty will apply with respect to the year in which the filer failed to make the initial solicitation. The penalty will apply to failures with respect to years for which a required solicitation is not made and to failures with respect to all subsequent years until the filer conducts its make-up solicitations. The penalty will not apply with respect to the year in which the first make-up solicitation is made (unless it is also the year in which the filer fails to make its initial solicitation) if the second make-up solicitation is made in the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A financial institution is not required to make an annual solicitation by mail on accounts with ``stop-mail'' or ``hold-mail'' instructions, provided

the filer furnishes the solicitation material to the payee in the same manner as it furnishes other mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A filer is not required to make annual solicitations on accounts with respect to which the filer undertook two consecutive annual mailings by December 31, 1989, under Q/A-5 through Q/A-7B or under Q/A-56 of Sec. 35a.9999-1 of the Temporary Employment Tax Regulations under the Interest and Dividend Tax Compliance Act of 1983, as provided under section 6676(b) (prior to its amendment by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A filer is not required to make annual solicitations by mail on accounts with respect to which the filer has an undeliverable address, i.e., where other mailings to that address have been returned to the filer because the address was incorrect and no new address has been provided to the filer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(vi) (A) and (C) of this section, no more than two annual solicitations are required under this paragraph (e) in order for a filer to establish reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner of making annual solicitations--by mail or telephone--(i) By mail. A mail solicitation must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By mail. A mail solicitation must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A letter informing the payee that he or she must provide his or her TIN and that he or she is subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service under section 6723 if he or she fails to furnish his or her TIN,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Form W-9 or an acceptable substitute form, as defined in Sec. 31.3406 (h)-3 (a), (b), or (c) of this chapter, on which the payee may provide the TIN, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A return envelope for the payee to provide the TIN which may be, but is not required to be, postage prepaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By telephone. An annual solicitation may be made by telephone if the solicitation procedure is reasonably designed and carried out in a manner that is conducive to obtaining the TIN. An annual solicitation is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) for a failure if the filer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Completes a call to each person with a missing TIN and speaks to an adult member of the household, or to an officer of the business or the organization,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requests the TIN of the payee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Informs the payee that he or she is subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service under section 6723 if he or she fails to furnish his or her TIN,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Maintains contemporaneous records showing that the solicitation was properly made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Provides such contemporaneous records to the Internal Revenue Service upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Acting in a responsible manner--special rules for incorrect TINS--(1) In general.

An initial solicitation for a payee's correct TIN must be made at the time the account is opened. The term ``account'' includes accounts, relationships, and other transactions. However, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph (f)(1)(i) with respect to a new account if the filer has the payee's TIN and uses that TIN for all accounts of the payee. For example, see Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter. Further, a filer is not required to make an initial solicitation under this paragraph (f)(1)(i) with respect to accounts for which the filer filed an information return subject to paragraph (h) of this section. For purposes of this section, the initial solicitation requirement is deemed to have been met with respect to accounts opened after December 31, 1989, and on or before April 22, 1991. No

additional solicitation is required after the filer receives the TIN unless the Internal Revenue Service or, in some cases, a broker notifies the filer that the TIN is incorrect. Following such notification the filer may be required to make an annual solicitation to obtain the correct TIN as provided in paragraph (f)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> First annual solicitation. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, a filer must undertake an annual solicitation only if the payor has been notified of an incorrect TIN and such account contains the incorrect TIN at the time of the notification. The first annual solicitation must be made as required by paragraph (f) (2) or (3) of this section, whichever applies. An account contains an incorrect TIN at the time of notification if the name and number combination on the account matches the name and number combination set forth on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker. A filer may be notified of an incorrect TIN by the Internal Revenue Service or by a broker pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) or by a penalty notice issued by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 6721. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the annual solicitation required by this paragraph (f) must be made on or before December 31 of the year in which the filer is notified of the incorrect TIN or by January 31 of the following year if the filer is notified of an incorrect TIN in the preceding December.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Second annual solicitation.

Is a payor subject to a penalty for a failure to provide a correct TIN on an information return with respect to a reportable interest or dividend payment if the payee has certified, under penalties of perjury, that the TIN furnished to the payor is the payee's correct number, the payor provided that number on an information return, and the number is later determined not to be the payee's correct number?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. A payor is not subject to a penalty for failure to provide the payee's correct TIN on an information return, if the payee has certified, under penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided to the payor was his correct number, and the payor included such number on the information return before being notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (or a broker) that the number is incorrect.
Due Diligence Defined for Accounts Opened and Instruments Acquired After</p><p class="depth0">December 31, 1983</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. In order for a payor of a reportable interest or dividend payment (other than in a window transaction) to be considered to have exercised due diligence in furnishing the correct TIN of a payee with respect to an account opened or an instrument acquired after December 31, 1983, what actions must the payor take?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. (1) In general, the payor of an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account nor a window transaction must use a TIN provided by the payee under penalties of perjury on information returns filed with the IRS to satisfy the due diligence requirement. Therefore, if a payor permits a payee to open an account without obtaining the payee's TIN under penalties of perjury and files an information return with the IRS with a missing or an incorrect TIN, the payor will be liable for the $50 penalty for the year with respect to which such information return is filed. However, in its administrative discretion, the IRS will not enforce the penalty with respect to a calendar year if the certified TIN is obtained after the account is opened and before December 31 of such year, provided that the payor exercises due diligence in processing such number, i.e., the payor uses the same care in processing the TIN provided by the payee that a reasonably prudent payor would use in the course of the payor's business in handling account information such as account numbers and balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Once notified by the IRS (or a broker) that a number is incorrect, a payor is liable for the penalty for all prior years in which an information return was filed with that particular incorrect number if the payor has not exercised due diligence with respect to such years. A pre-existing certified TIN does not constitute an exercise of due diligence after the IRS or a broker notifies the payor that the number is incorrect unless the payor undertakes the actions described in Sec. 31.3406(d)-5(d)(2)(i) of this chapter with respect to accounts receiving reportable payments described in section 3406(b)(1) and reported on information returns described in sections 6724(d)(1)(A) (i) through (iv).</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. Is a payor as described in A-2 liable for the penalty if the payor obtained a certified TIN from a payee but inadvertently processed the name or number incorrectly on the information return?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. Yes. The payor is liable for the penalty unless the payor exercised that degree of care in processing the TIN and name and in furnishing it on the information return that a reasonably prudent payor would use in the course of the payor's business in handling account information, such as account numbers and account balances.</p><p class="depth0">Special Rules</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. With respect to an instrument transferred without the assistance of a broker, is a payor liable for the penalty for filing an information return with a missing or an incorrect TIN if the payor records on its books a transfer of a readily tradable instrument in a transaction in which the payor was not a party?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. Generally, a payor as described in Q-4 will be considered to have exercised due diligence with respect to a readily tradable instrument that is not part of a pre-1984 account with the payor if the payor records on its books

a transfer in which the payor was not a party. This exception applies until the calendar year in which the payor receives a certified TIN from the payee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. Is the payor described in A-4 required to solicit the TIN of a payee of an account with a missing TIN in order to be considered as having exercised due diligence in a subsequent calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. There is no requirement on the payor to solicit the TIN in order to be considered to have exercised due diligence in a subsequent calendar year under the rule set forth in A-4.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. Is a payor as described in Q-4 considered to have exercised due diligence if the payee provides a TIN to the payor (whether or not certified), the payor uses that number on the information return filed for the payee, and the number is later determined to be incorrect?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. A payor as described in Q-4 who records on its books a transfer in which it was not a party is considered to have exercised due diligence under the rule set forth in A-4 where the transfer is accompanied with a TIN provided that the payor uses the same care in processing the TIN provided by a payee that a reasonably prudent payor would use in the course of the payor's business in handling account information, such as account numbers and account balances. Thus, a payor will not be liable for the penalty if the payor uses the TIN provided by the payee on information returns that it files, even if the TIN provided by the payee is later determined to be incorrect. However, a payor will not be considered as having exercised due diligence under A-4 after the IRS or a broker notifies the payor that the number is incorrect unless the payor undertakes the required additional actions described in the second paragraph of A-2.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. Is a payor liable for a penalty for filing an information return with a missing or an incorrect TIN with respect to a post-1983 account or instrument if the payor could have met the due diligence requirements but for the fact that the payor incurred an undue hardship?</p><p class="depth0">A-7. A payor of a post-1983 account or instrument is not liable for a penalty under section 6721(a) for filing an information return with a missing or an incorrect TIN if the IRS determines that the payor could have satisfied the due diligence requirements but for the fact that the payor incurred an undue hardship. An undue hardship is an extraordinary or unexpected event such as the destruction of records or place of business of the payor by fire or other casualty (or the place of business of the payor's agent who under a pre-existing written contract had agreed to fulfill the payor's due diligence obligations with respect to the account subject to the penalty and there was no means for the obligations to be performed by another agent or the payor). Undue hardship will also be found to exist if the payor could have met the due diligence requirements only by incurring an extraordinary cost.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. How does a payor obtain a determination from the IRS that the payor has met the undue hardship exception to the penalty under section 6721(a) for the failure to include the correct TIN on an information return for the year with respect to which the payor is subject to the penalty?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. A determination of undue hardship may be established only by submitting a written statement to the IRS signed under penalties of perjury that sets forth all the facts and circumstances that make an affirmative showing that the payor could have satisfied the due diligence requirements but for the occurrence of an undue hardship. Thus, the statement must describe the undue hardship and make an affirmative showing that the payor either was in the process of exercising or stood ready to exercise due diligence when the undue hardship occurred. A payor may request an undue hardship determination from the district director or the director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the payor is required to remit the penalty under section 6721(a).</p><p class="depth0">Q-9. Is a pre-1984 account or instrument of a payor that is exchanged for an account or instrument of another payor as a result of a merger of the other payor or acquisition of the accounts or instruments of such payor transformed into a post-1983 account or instrument if the merger or acquisition occurs after December 31, 1983?</p><p class="depth0">A-9. No. A pre-1984 account or instrument that is exchanged for another account or instrument pursuant to a statutory merger or the acquisition of accounts or instruments is not transformed into a post-1983 account or instrument because the exchange occurs without the participation of the payee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10. May the acquiring taxpayer described in A-9 rely upon the business records and past procedures of the merged payor or the payor whose accounts or instruments were acquired in order to establish that due diligence has been exercised on the acquired pre-1984 and post-1983 accounts or instruments?</p><p class="depth0">A-10. Yes. The acquiring payor may rely upon the business records and past procedures of the merged payor or of the payor whose accounts or instruments were acquired in order to establish due diligence to avoid the penalty under section 6721(a) with respect to information returns that have been or will be filed.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11. To what extent may a payor rely on the due diligence rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 35a.9999-1, 35a.9999-2, and 35a.9999-3 of this chapter in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see Sec.

The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On August 1, 1991, Individual A, an independent contractor, establishes a relationship (``an account'') with Institution L, which pays A amounts reportable under section 6041. When A opens the account L requests that A supply his TIN on the account creation document. A fails to provide his TIN. On October 1, 1991, L mails a solicitation for A's TIN that satisfies the requirement of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. A does not provide a TIN to L during 1991. L timely files an information return subject to section 6721, that does not contain A's TIN, for payments made during the 1991 calendar year with respect to A's account. A penalty is imposed on L pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for L's failure to file a correct information return because A's TIN was not shown on the return. The penalty will be waived, however, if L establishes that the failure was due to reasonable cause as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To establish reasonable cause under this section, L must satisfy both paragraphs (c)(6) and (d) of this section. The criteria for obtaining a waiver under these paragraphs are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> L acted in a responsible manner in attempting to satisfy the information reporting requirement as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> L demonstrates that the failure arose from events beyond L's control, as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, L may demonstrate that it acted in a responsible manner only by complying with paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section requires a filer to request a TIN at the time the account is opened (the initial solicitation) and, if the filer does not receive the TIN at that time, to solicit the TIN on or before December 31 of the year the account is opened (for accounts opened before December) or January 31 of the following year (for accounts in the preceding December) (the annual solicitation). Because L has performed these solicitations within the time and in the manner prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, L has acted in a responsible manner as described in paragraph (d) of this section. L satisfies paragraph (c)(6) of this section because under the facts, L can show that the failure was caused by A's failure to provide a TIN, an event beyond L's control. As a result, L has established reasonable cause under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Therefore, the penalty imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for the failure on the 1991 information return is waived. See section 3406(a)(1)(A) which requires L to impose backup withholding on reportable payments to A if L has not received A's TIN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On August 1, 1991, Individual B opens an account with Bank M, which pays B interest reportable under section 6049.

On February 28, 1992, M includes the TIM that B provided on the Form 1099-INT for the 1991 calendar year. In October 1992 the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B), notifies M that the 1991 return filed for B contains an incorrect TIN. In April 1993 a penalty is imposed on M pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for M's failure to file a correct information return for the 1991 calendar year, i.e., the return did not contain B's correct TIN. The penalty will be waived, however, if M establishes that the failure was due to reasonable cause as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To establish reasonable cause under this section, M must satisfy the criteria in both paragraphs (c)(6) and (d) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, M can demonstrate that it acted in a responsible manner only if M complies with paragraph (f) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section requires a filer to request a TIN at the time the account is opened, an initial solicitation. Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section the initial solicitation relates to failures on returns filed for the year an account is opened. Because M performed the initial solicitation in 1991 in the time and manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and reflected the TIM received from B on the 1991 return as required by paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, M has acted in a responsible manner as described in paragraph (d) of this section. M satisfies paragraph (c)(6) of this section because, under the facts, M can show that the failure was caused by B's failure to provide a correct TIN, an event beyond M's control. As a result, M has established reasonable cause under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Therefore, the penalty imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for the failure on the 1991 information return is waived.

Therefore, the penalty imposed under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for the failure on the 1992 return is waived due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Table.

In 1992, Mortgage Finance Company N lends money to C to purchase property in a transaction subject to reporting under section 6050H and to section 6721. As part of the transaction, C gives N a promissory note providing for repayment of principal and the payment of interest. At the time C incurs the obligation N requests C's TIN, as required under Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. C fails to provide the TIN as required by Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. N sends solicitations by mail in 1992 and 1993 for the missing TIN, which C fails to provide. However, for 1994 M fails to send the solicitation required by Sec. 1.6050H-2(f) of this chapter. N files returns for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 calendar years pursuant to section 6050H without C's TIN. Although N made the initial and the first annual solicitations in 1992 and the second annual solicitation in 1993, N did not solicit the TIN in 1994 as required under section 6050H, which requires continued annual solicitations until the TIN is obtained. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(1)(vi)(A) of this section the penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6721-1 for the 1994 information return is not waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Table.

When E opens the account, R requests that E supply his TIN on an account creation document, which E does. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, R uses the TIN furnished by E on the information return filed for the 1991 calendar year. In October 1992 the Internal Revenue Service notifies R pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) that the information return filed for E for the 1991 calendar year contained an incorrect TIN. At the time R receives this notification, E's account contains the incorrect TIN. On December 31, 1992, R telephones E pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section and receives different TIN information from E. R uses this information on the return that it files timely for E for the 1992 calendar year, i.e., in February 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In April 1993, the Internal Revenue Service notifies R pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 301.6721-1 that the information return filed for the 1991 calendar year contains an incorrect TIN.

Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, R can demonstrate that it acted in a responsible manner only if it complies with paragraph (f) of this section. R solicited E's TIN at the time the account was opened (initial solicitation). Under paragraphs (d)(2) and (f)(4) of this section, the initial solicitation relates to failures on returns filed for the year in which an account is opened (i.e., 1991) and for subsequent years until the calendar year in which the filer receivers a notification of an incorrect TIN pursuant to section 3406. Because E failed to provide the correct TIN upon request, the failure arose from events beyond R's control as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Therefore, the penalty with respect to the failure on the 1991 calendar year information return is waived due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6.

Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, R must make an annual solicitation after being notified of an incorrect TIN if the payee's account contains the incorrect TIN at the time of the notification. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section provides that if the filer is notified pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(B) the time and manner of making an annual solicitation is that required under Sec. 31.3406(d)-5(g)(1)(ii) of this chapter. Section 31.3406(d)-5(g)(1)(ii) of this chapter requires R to notify E by mail within 15 business days after the date of the notice from the Internal Revenue Service, which R failed to do.

Sec. 301.6723-1A  Failure to include correct information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If any person files an information return (as defined in section 6724(d)(1)) or furnishes a payee statement (as defined in section 6724(d)(2)) the due date for which, determined without regard to extensions, is after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1990, and such person fails to include all of the information required to be shown on such return or statement or includes incorrect information, such person will be considered to have failed to include correct information. For this purpose, information required to be shown on a return or statement is the information required by the applicable information reporting statute or by any administrative pronouncement issued thereunder (such as a regulation, revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or information reporting form). Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person who fails to include correct information shall pay $5 for each return or statement with respect to which such failure occurs; however, the total amount imposed on any person for all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed $20,000. See paragraph (e) of this section regarding the higher penalties for intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement and for interest and dividend returns and statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception for inconsequential omissions and inaccuracies--(1) Exception. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed for any failure to include correct information on an information return if the failure does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating the information required to be shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax return. Similarly, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed for any failure to include correct information on a payee statement if the failure cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exception. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed for any failure to include correct information on an information return if the failure does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating the information required to be shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax return. Similarly, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed for any failure to include correct information on a payee statement if the failure cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A payor files a form 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous income) with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishes a corresponding statement to the payee. Both the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement are complete and correct, except that the word ``Street'' is misspelled in the payee's address. The error does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating the information required to be shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax return. In addition, the error cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return. Therefore, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the only error on the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement is that the payee's first name, ``William,'' is misspelled as ``Willaim.'' The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed, for the reasons set forth in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the only error on the form 1099-MISC and the payee statement is that the payee's street address, 4821 Main Street, is incorrectly reported as 8421 Main Street. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will not be assessed with respect to the form 1099-MISC if the error does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing the return or from correlating the information required to be shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax return. However, the penalty will be assessed with respect to the payee statement because the error can reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return. See paragraph (d) of this section regarding waiver of the penalty for reasonable cause or due diligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exception for corrected omissions and inaccuracies--(1) Exception.

filed the return or furnished the statement corrects the failure by the earliest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exception. The penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section generally will not be assessed for a failure to include correct information on an information return or payee statement if the person who

filed the return or furnished the statement corrects the failure by the earliest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date that is 30 days after the date that the person discovers the failure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date that is 30 days after the date of a written request, from the Internal Revenue Service to the person, for corrected information; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> October 1 (March 1 for payee statements) of the calendar year in which the return or statement is due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, timely correction of a failure to include correct information on a return or statement will not prevent assessment of the penalty for any failure that is part of a pattern of conduct, by the person who filed the return or furnished the statement, of repeatedly failing to include correct information. Further, correction of a failure to include correct information will not prevent assessment of the penalty for intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to intentional disregard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In January 1987, Bank M prepares forms 1099-INT (relating to interest income) with respect to interest income earned by its depositors in calendar year 1986. M timely files the forms with the Internal Revenue Service and timely furnishes copies to its depositors. On March 16, 1987, M discovers that the amount of backup withholding tax (Federal income tax withheld) was inadvertently omitted from several of the forms and payee copies. Several days later M files corrected forms with the Service and furnishes corrected copies to the affected payees. The penalty for failure to include correct information will not be due with respect to the incomplete forms 1099-INT filed with the Internal Revenue Service, since they were corrected within 30 days after M discovered the omission and before October 1, 1987. However, the penalty will be due with respect to the incomplete copies furnished to the payees, since they were not corrected by March 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In January 1987, Corporation N files forms 1099-DIV (relating to dividends and distributions) for calendar year 1986 and furnishes copies to its shareholders. A significant number of the forms and payee copies do not include the amount of backup withholding tax. On December 1, 1987, the Internal Revenue Service provides N with a written request for corrected information. On December 15, 1987, N files corrected forms with the Service and furnishes corrected copies to the payees. The penalty for failure to include correct information will be due with respect to the incomplete forms, since they were not corrected by October 1, 1987. In addition, the penalty will be due with respect to the incomplete copies furnished to the payees, since they were not corrected by March 1, 1987. However, N's correction of the forms is a fact to be considered, along with other facts, in determining whether the higher penalty for intentional failures will be imposed; see paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In January 1987, Corporation O files forms 1099-DIV for calendar year 1986 and furnishes copies to its shareholders. O intentionally does not include the amount of backup withholding tax for any shareholder. Since the omissions represent an intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement, correction of the omissions will not prevent assessment of the penalty for intentional failure to include correct information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Waiver for reasonable cause or due diligence--(1) Reasonable cause. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (relating to interest or dividend returns or statements), the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will be waived for any failure to include correct information if it is established to the satisfaction of the district director or the director of the internal revenue service center that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable cause. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (relating to interest or dividend returns or statements), the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will be waived for any failure to include correct information if it is established to the satisfaction of the district director or the director of the internal revenue service center that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Due diligence. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section will not apply in the case of any interest or dividend return or statement (as defined in section 6724(c)(5). However, in such a case, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section will be waived for any failure to include correct information if it is established to the satisfaction of the district director or the director of the internal revenue service center that the person otherwise liable for such penalty exercised due diligence in attempting to include such information. The requirement to exercise due diligence imposes a higher standard of conduct than required under the reasonable cause defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedure for seeking waiver. Reasonable cause (or due diligence) may be

established only by submitting a written statement that sets forth all the facts alleged as reasonable cause (or due diligence) and makes an affirmative showing of reasonable cause (or due diligence). The statement must be signed by the person required to file the information return or furnish the payee statement to which the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section relates, and must contain a declaration that is is made under the penalties of perjury. See Sec. 301.6061-1 for rules on the signing of returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Higher penalties in certain cases--(1) Intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement--(i) Application of section 6723(b). If a person fails to include correct information on an information return and such failure is due to intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such return will be determined under section 6723(b). The penalty prescribed by section 6723(b) for such a return is $100 or, if greater, the amount equal to 10 percent (or, in some cases, 5 percent) of the aggregate amount of the items required to be reported correctly on the return. In the case of any penalty determined under section 6723(b), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply. In addition, such penalty will not be taken into account in applying the $20,000 limitation to penalties not determined under section 6723(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement--(i) Application of section 6723(b). If a person fails to include correct information on an information return and such failure is due to intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such return will be determined under section 6723(b). The penalty prescribed by section 6723(b) for such a return is $100 or, if greater, the amount equal to 10 percent (or, in some cases, 5 percent) of the aggregate amount of the items required to be reported correctly on the return. In the case of any penalty determined under section 6723(b), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply. In addition, such penalty will not be taken into account in applying the $20,000 limitation to penalties not determined under section 6723(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of section 6723(b). If a person fails to include correct information on an information return and such failure is due to intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such return will be determined under section 6723(b). The penalty prescribed by section 6723(b) for such a return is $100 or, if greater, the amount equal to 10 percent (or, in some cases, 5 percent) of the aggregate amount of the items required to be reported correctly on the return. In the case of any penalty determined under section 6723(b), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply. In addition, such penalty will not be taken into account in applying the $20,000 limitation to penalties not determined under section 6723(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meaning of intentional disregard. A failure to include correct information on an information return will be treated as due to intentional disregard of the correct information reporting requirement if the person who filed the return knowingly or willfully failed to include correct information at the time the return was filed. Whether a person knowingly or willfully failed to include correct information will be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances in the particular case. Facts and circumstances to be considered for this purpose include, but are not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the failure to include correct information is part of a pattern of conduct, by the person who filed the return, of repeatedly failing to include correct information on information returns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether the person who filed the return corrects the failure within 30 days after the date of any written request from the Internal Revenue Service for corrected information; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Whether the person who filed the return can reasonably be expected to have discovered the failure during the calendar year the return was due and, if so, whether timely correction was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest and dividend returns and statements. In the case of any interest or dividend return or statement (as defined in section 6724(c)(5)), the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply. In addition, any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such a return or statement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Will not be taken into account in applying the $20,000 limitation of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to other returns or statements, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Will not be taken into account in applying the $100,000 limitations of sections 6721(a) and 6722(a) with respect to any return or statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Manner of payment--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (relating to interest and dividend returns and statements), any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section shall be paid on notice and demand by the Internal Revenue Service and in the same manner as a tax liability is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (relating to interest and dividend returns and statements), any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section shall be paid on notice and demand by the Internal Revenue Service and in the same manner as a tax liability is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Self-assessment for interest and dividend returns and statements. Any penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to an interest or dividend return or statement will be assessed and collected in the same manner as an excise tax imposed by subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code, and the deficiency procedures of subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Code will not apply. In such a case, the penalty must be self-assessed and will be due and payable on April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the return or statement is required. The penalty should be remitted with a properly executed Form 8210 (Self-Assessed Penalties Return).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Coordination with other penalties--(1) Penalty for failure to supply identifying numbers. Pursuant to section 6723(c), no penalty shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any return or statement if a penalty is imposed under section 6676 (relating to the failure to supply identifying numbers) with respect to such return or statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Penalty for failure to supply identifying numbers. Pursuant to section 6723(c), no penalty shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any return or statement if a penalty is imposed under section 6676 (relating to the failure to supply identifying numbers) with respect to such return or statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Penalty for failure to file information returns or furnish payee statements. No penalty shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any return or statement if a penalty is imposed under section 6721 (relating to the failure to file certain information returns) or section 6722 (relating to the failure to furnish certain payee statements) with respect to such return or statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation P timely files Forms 1099-DIV (relating to dividends and distributions) for a calendar year and furnishes copies to its shareholders. Several of these forms and shareholder copies do not include correct taxpayer identification numbers (TINs), and Corporation P does not show that it exercised due diligence in attempting to include correct TINs; therefore, a penalty is imposed under section 6676(b) with respect to these several forms and shareholder copies. Since a penalty is imposed under section 6676, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the same several forms and shareholder copies.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation Q, a bank, fails to file certain required Forms 1099-INT (relating to interest income of its depositors) in a timely fashion. Corporation Q claims that it exercised due diligence in attempting to file the forms on time and that therefore no penalty under section 6721 or 6723 should apply. If the Internal Revenue Service finds that Corporation Q did not exercise due diligence and imposes the failure-to-file penalty under section 6721 with respect to the forms, no penalty will be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation R files with the Internal Revenue Service a document purporting to be an information return. The document contains so many omissions and inaccuracies that its utility as an information return is minimized or eliminated. The Service imposes the failure-to-file penalty under section 6721 with respect to the document. Since the failure-to-file penalty is imposed, no penalty will be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date.
