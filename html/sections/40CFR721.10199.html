                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substance identified generically as substituted aliphatic amine (PMN P-06-702) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified generically as substituted aliphatic amine (PMN P-06-702) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). Ansell NEOX style 9-912 gloves have been shown to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 721.63(a)(3)(i) for up to 110 minutes. Respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50. The following NIOSH-approved respirators meet the requirements for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): Air purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with the appropriate combination cartridges, cartridges should be tested and approved for the gas/vapor substance (i.e., organic vapor, acid gas, or substance-specific cartridge) and should include a particulate filter (N100 if oil aerosols are absent, R100, or P100); powered air-

purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting facepiece (full-face) and the appropriate combination cartridges, cartridges should be tested and approved for the gas/vapor substance (i.e., organic vapor, acid gas, or substance-specific cartridges) and should include High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a tight-fitting face piece (full-face). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.14 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the Sec. 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under Sec. 721.30. Persons whose Sec. 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iv), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv), (g)(2)(v), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(iii), and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.80(r).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Release to water. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.90 (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. Recordkeeping requirements as specified in Sec. 721.125 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.
