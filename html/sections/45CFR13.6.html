                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Awards will be limited to the rates customarily charged by  persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and  expert witnesses. If a party has already received, or is eligible to  receive, reimbursement for any expenses under another statutory  provision or another program allowing reimbursement, its award under  these rules must be reduced by the amount the prevailing party has  already received, or is eligible to receive, from the Federal  government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An award for the fees of an attorney or agent may not exceed  $125.00 per hour, regardless of the actual rate charged by the attorney  or agent. An award for the fees of an expert witness may not exceed the  highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses, which is  $24.09 per hour, regardless of the actual rates charged by the witness.  These limits apply only to fees; an award may include the reasonable  expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the  attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges separately for such  expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining the reasonableness of the fees sought for  attorneys, agents or expert witnesses, the adjudicative officer must  consider factors bearing on the request, which include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or  her customary fee for like services; if the attorney, agent or witness  is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in  which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or  complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services  provided.
