                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bentonite  (Al2O34SiO2nH2O, CAS Reg.  No. 1302-78-9) is principally a colloidal hydrated aluminum silicate.  Bentonite contains varying quantities of iron, alkalies, and alkaline  earths in the commercial products. Depending on the cations present,  natural deposits of bentonite range in color from white to gray, yellow,  green, or blue. Bentonite's fine particles provide large total surface  area and, hence, pronounced adsorptive capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient must be of a purity suitable for its intended  use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with Sec. 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in  food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice.  The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe  (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following  current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ingredient is used as a processing aid as defined in  Sec. 170.3(o)(24) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current  good manufacturing practice.
