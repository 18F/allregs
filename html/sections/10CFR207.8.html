Any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is carried on may, upon petition by the Attorney General at the request of the Administrator, in the case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the Administrator issued under this subpart, issue an order requiring compliance. Any failure to obey such an order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Injunctions. Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any regulation or order issued under this subpart, the Administrator may request the Attorney General to bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States to enjoin such acts or practices and, upon a proper showing, a temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction shall be granted without bond. The relief sought may include a mandatory injunction commanding any person to comply with any provision of such order or regulation, the violation of which is prohibited by section 12(a) of ESECA, as implemented by this subpart.</p>
