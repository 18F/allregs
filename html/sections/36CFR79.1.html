They establish:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures and guidelines to manage and preserve collections;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Terms and conditions for Federal agencies to include in contracts, memoranda, agreements or other written instruments with repositories for curatorial services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standards to determine when a repository has the capability to provide long-term curatorial services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guidelines to provide access to, loan and otherwise use collections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations in this part contain three appendices that provide additional guidance for use by the Federal Agency Official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appendix A to these regulations contains an example of an agreement between a Federal agency and a non- Federal owner of material remains who is donating the remains to the Federal agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appendix B to these regulations contains an example of a memorandum of understanding between a Federal agency and a repository for long-term curatorial services for a federally-owned collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appendix C to these regulations contains an example of an agreement between a repository and a third party for a short-term loan of a federally-owned collection (or a part thereof).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The three appendices are meant to illustrate how such agreements might appear. They should be revised according to the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Needs of the Federal agency and any non-Federal owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nature and content of the collection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Type of contract, memorandum, agreement or other written instrument being used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When a repository has preexisting standard forms (e.g., a short-term loan form) that are consistent with the regulations in this part, those forms may be used in lieu of developing new ones.
