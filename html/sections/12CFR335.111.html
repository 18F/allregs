Required schedules are codified and are found within the context of the SEC's regulations. All forms and schedules shall be titled with the name of the FDIC in substitution for the name of the SEC. The filing of forms and schedules shall be made with the FDIC at the address in Sec. 335.701 or may be filed electronically at FDICconnect at https://www2.fdicconnect.gov/index.asp. However, electronic filing of Beneficial Ownership Forms 3, 4 and 5 is required.
