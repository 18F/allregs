                                Sec. 351.219  Reviews of countervailing duty orders in connection
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Section 753 of the Act is a transition provision  for countervailing duty orders that were issued under section 303 of the  Act without an injury determination by the Commission. Under the  Subsidies Agreement, one country may not impose countervailing duties on  imports from another WTO Member without first making a determination  that such imports have caused injury to a domestic industry. Section 753  provides a mechanism for providing an injury test with respect to those  ``no-injury'' orders under section 303 that apply to merchandise from  WTO Members. This section contains rules regarding requests for section  753 investigations by a domestic interested party; and the procedures  that the Department will follow in reviewing a countervailing duty order  and providing the Commission with advice regarding the amount and nature  of a countervailable subsidy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of domestic interested parties. The Secretary will  notify directly domestic interested parties as soon as possible after  the opportunity arises for requesting an investigation by the Commission  under section 753 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initiation and conduct of section 753 review. Where the  Secretary deems it necessary in order to provide to the Commission  information on the amount or nature of a countervailable subsidy (see  section 753(b)(2) of the Act), the Secretary may initiate a section 753  review of the countervailing duty order in question. The Secretary will  conduct a section 753 review in accordance with Sec. 351.221.</p>
