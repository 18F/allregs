                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowance transfer deadline. The CAIR NOX allowances  are available to be deducted for compliance with a source's CAIR  NOX emissions limitation for a control period in a given  calendar year only if the CAIR NOX allowances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior  year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer  deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance  account by a CAIR NOX allowance transfer correctly submitted  for recordation under Sec. Sec. 97.160 and 97.161 by the allowance  transfer deadline for the control period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in  accordance with Sec. 97.161, of CAIR NOX allowance transfers  submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the  allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will  deduct from the compliance account CAIR NOX allowances  available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine  whether the source meets the CAIR NOX emissions limitation  for the control period, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Until the amount of CAIR NOX allowances deducted  equals the number of tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions, determined  in accordance with subpart HH of this part, from all CAIR NOX  units at the source for the control period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there are insufficient CAIR NOX allowances to  complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, until no  more CAIR NOX allowances available under paragraph (a) of  this section remain in the compliance account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of CAIR NOX allowances by serial number. The  CAIR authorized account representative for a source's compliance account  may request that specific CAIR NOX allowances, identified by  serial number, in the compliance account be deducted for emissions or  excess emissions for a control period in accordance with paragraph (b)  or (d) of this section. Such request shall be submitted to the  Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline for the control period  and include, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, the  identification of the CAIR NOX source and the appropriate  serial numbers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct CAIR  NOX allowances under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section  from the source's compliance account, in the absence of an  identification or in the case of a partial identification of CAIR  NOX allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the  following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any CAIR NOX allowances that were allocated to the  units at the source, in the order of recordation; and then</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any CAIR NOX allowances that were allocated to any  entity and transferred and recorded in the compliance account pursuant  to subpart GG of this part, in the order of recordation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deductions for excess emissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After making the deductions  for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period  in a calendar year in which the CAIR NOX source has excess  emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance  account an amount of CAIR NOX allowances, allocated for the  control period in the immediately following calendar year, equal to 3  times the number of tons of the source's excess emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of  the CAIR NOX source or the CAIR NOX units at the  source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to  comply with any other remedy, for the same violations, as ordered under  the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the  appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under  paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and subpart II.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administrator's action on submissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator may  review and conduct independent audits concerning any submission under  the CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program and make appropriate  adjustments of the information in the submissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may deduct CAIR NOX allowances from  or transfer CAIR NOX allowances to a source's compliance  account based on the information in the submissions, as adjusted under  paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and record such deductions and  transfers.</p>
