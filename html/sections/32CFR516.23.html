Include a complete statement of the facts  upon which the action and any defense thereto are based. Where possible,  support facts by reference to documents or witness statements. Include  details of previous administrative actions, such as the filing and  results of an administrative claim. If the action is predicated on the  Federal Tort Claims Act, include a description of the plaintiff's  relationship to the United States, its instrumentalities, or its  contractors. Also include a statement whether an insurance company or  other third party has an interest in the plaintiff's claim by  subrogation or otherwise and whether there are additional claims related  to the same incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Setoff or Counterclaim. Discuss whether setoff or counterclaim  exists. If so, highlight the supportive facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responses to Pleadings. Prepare a draft answer or other  appropriate response to the pleadings. (See figure C-1, to this part).  Discuss whether allegations of fact are well-founded. Refer to evidence  that refutes factual allegations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Memorandum of Law. Include a brief statement of the applicable  law with citations to legal authority. Discussions of local law, if  applicable, should cover relevant issues such as measure of damages,  scope of employment, effect of contributory negligence, or limitations  upon death and survival actions. Do not unduly delay submission of a  litigation report to prepare a comprehensive memorandum of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Potential witness information. List each person having  information relevant to the case and provide an office address and  telephone number. If there is no objection, provide the individual's  social security account number, home address, and telephone number.

Finally, summarize the information or potential  testimony that each person listed could provide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exhibits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is  ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil  Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA,   each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References to  exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of  particular exhibits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating  officers, boards or similar data should be attached, although such  reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete  litigation report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA  request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise identify the  requestor and the records released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Distribution and number of copies. Unless HQDA directs  otherwise, SJAs or legal advisers will mail (first class) an original  and one copy of the litigation report to the responsible HQDA office  (See Sec. 516.15 of this part) and one copy to the U.S. Attorney's  Office handling the case. If possible, record the litigation report onto  a magnetic diskette, using either WordPerfect, Enable, or ACSII, and  send it to Litigation Division.</p>
