                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party may make a motion to the Presiding Officer on any  matter relating to the evidentiary hearing in accordance with the  scheduling orders issued under Sec. 78.13 of this part. All motions  shall be in writing and served as provided in Sec. 78.4 of this part,  except those made on the record during an oral hearing before the  Presiding Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any party may make a motion for a summary disposition in its  favor on any factual issue on the basis that there is no genuine issue  of material fact. When a motion for summary disposition is made and  supported, any party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere  allegations or denials, but must show, by affidavit or by other  materials subject to consideration by the Presiding Officer, that there  is a genuine issue of material fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 10 days (or other shorter, reasonable period established  by the Presiding Officer) after a motion made on the record or service  of any written motion, any party may file a response to the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Presiding Officer may schedule an oral argument and call for  the filing of briefs on any motion. The Presiding Officer will rule on  the motion within a reasonable time after the date that responses to the  motion may be filed under paragraph (c) of this section and that any  oral argument or filing of briefs is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If all factual issues are decided by summary disposition prior  to the hearing, no hearing will be held and the Presiding Officer will  issue a proposed decision under Sec. 78.18 of this part. If a summary  disposition is denied or if partial summary disposition is granted, the  hearing shall proceed on the remaining issues.
