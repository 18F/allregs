                            <p class="depth0">To determine whether an employee's suggestions and recommendations  are given ``particular weight,'' factors to be considered include, but  are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee's job duties to  make such suggestions and recommendations; the frequency with which such  suggestions and recommendations are made or requested; and the frequency  with which the employee's suggestions and recommendations are relied  upon. Generally, an executive's suggestions and recommendations must  pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and regularly  directs. It does not include an occasional suggestion with regard to the  change in status of a co-worker. An employee's suggestions and  recommendations may still be deemed to have ``particular weight'' even  if a higher level manager's recommendation has more importance and even  if the employee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as  to the employee's change in status.</p>
