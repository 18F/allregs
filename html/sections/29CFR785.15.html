                            <p class="depth0">A stenographer who reads a book while waiting for dictation, a  messenger who works a crossword puzzle while awaiting assignments,  fireman who plays checkers while waiting for alarms and a factory worker  who talks to his fellow employees while waiting for machinery to be  repaired are all working during their periods of inactivity. The rule  also applies to employees who work away from the plant. For example, a  repair man is working while he waits for his employer's customer to get  the premises in readiness. The time is worktime even though the employee  is allowed to leave the premises or the job site during such periods of  inactivity. The periods during which these occur are unpredictable. They  are usually of short duration. In either event the employee is unable to  use the time   effectively for his own purposes. It belongs to and is controlled by the  employer. In all of these cases waiting is an integral part of the job.  The employee is engaged to wait. (See: Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134,  137 (1944); Wright v. Carrigg, 275 F. 2d 448, 14 W.H. Cases (C.A. 4,  1960); Mitchell v. Wigger, 39 Labor Cases, para. 66,278, 14 W.H. Cases  534 (D.N.M. 1960); Mitchell v. Nicholson, 179 F. Supp, 292,14 W.H. Cases  487 (W.D.N.C. 1959))</p>
