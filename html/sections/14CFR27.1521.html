                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The powerplant limitations prescribed in this section  must be established so that they do not exceed the corresponding limits  for which the engines are type certificated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Takeoff operation. The powerplant takeoff operation must be  limited by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum value shown during the type tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable manifold pressure (for reciprocating  engines);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time limit for the use of the power corresponding to the  limitations established in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the time limit in paragraph (b)(3) of this section exceeds  two minutes, the maximum allowable cylinder head, coolant outlet, or oil  temperatures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The gas temperature limits for turbine engines over the range of  operating and atmospheric conditions for which certification is  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuous operation. The continuous operation must be limited  by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum rotational speed which may not be greater than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum value shown during the type tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum rotational speed shown under the rotor speed  requirements in Sec. 27.1509(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gas temperature limits for turbine engines over the range of  operating and atmospheric conditions for which certification is  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel grade or designation. The minimum fuel grade (for  reciprocating engines), or fuel designation (for turbine engines), must  be established so that it is not less than that required for the  operation of the engines within the limitations in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Turboshaft engine torque. For rotorcraft with main rotors driven  by turboshaft engines, and that do not have a torque limiting device in  the transmission system, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A limit engine torque must be established if the maximum torque  that the engine can exert is greater than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The torque that the rotor drive system is designed to transmit;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The torque that the main rotor assembly is designed to  withstand in showing compliance with Sec. 27.547(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The limit engine torque established under paragraph (e)(1) of  this section may not exceed either torque specified in paragraph  (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ambient temperature. For turbine engines, ambient temperature  limitations (including limitations for winterization installations, if  applicable) must be established as the maximum ambient atmospheric  temperature at which compliance with the cooling provisions of  Sec. Sec. 27.1041 through 27.1045 is shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Two and one-half-minute OEI power operation. Unless otherwise  authorized, the use of 2\1/2\-minute OEI power must be limited to engine  failure operation of multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for not  longer than 2\1/2\ minutes after failure of an engine.

Rated 30-second OEI power  is permitted only on multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft, also  certificated for the use of rated 2-minute OEI power, and can only be  used for continued operation of the remaining engine(s) after a failure  or precautionary shutdown of an engine. It must be shown that following  application of 30-second OEI power, any damage will be readily  detectable by the applicable inspections and other related procedures  furnished in accordance with Section A27.4 of appendix A of this part  and Section A33.4 of appendix A of part 33. The use of 30-second OEI  power must be limited to not more than 30 seconds for any period in  which that power is used, and by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum value demonstrated during the type tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable gas temperature; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum allowable torque.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Rated 2-minute OEI power operation.
