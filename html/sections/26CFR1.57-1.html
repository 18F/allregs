                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accelerated depreciation on section 1250 property--(1) In general. Section 57(a)(2) provides that, with respect to each item of section 1250 property (as defined in section 1250(c)), there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year for depreciation or amortization exceeds the deduction which would have been allowable for the taxable year if the taxpayer had depreciated the property under the straight line method for each year of its useful life for which the taxpayer has held the property. The determination of the excess under section 57(a)(2) is made with respect to each separate item of section 1250 property.

Accordingly, where the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable with respect to one item of section 1250 property if the taxpayer had originally used the straight line method exceeds the allowable depreciation or amortization with respect to such property, such excess may not be used to reduce the amount of the item of tax preference resulting from another item of section 1250 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 57(a)(2) provides that, with respect to each item of section 1250 property (as defined in section 1250(c)), there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year for depreciation or amortization exceeds the deduction which would have been allowable for the taxable year if the taxpayer had depreciated the property under the straight line method for each year of its useful life for which the taxpayer has held the property. The determination of the excess under section 57(a)(2) is made with respect to each separate item of section 1250 property.

Accordingly, where the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable with respect to one item of section 1250 property if the taxpayer had originally used the straight line method exceeds the allowable depreciation or amortization with respect to such property, such excess may not be used to reduce the amount of the item of tax preference resulting from another item of section 1250 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate items of section 1250 property. The determination of what constitutes a separate item of section 1250 property is to be made on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. In general, each building (or component thereof, if the taxpayer uses the component method of computing depreciation) is a separate item of section 1250 property. However, for purposes of this section, assets placed in a group, classified, or composite account are to be treated as a single item by a taxpayer, provided that such account contains only property placed in service during a single taxable year. In addition, two or more items may be treated as one item of section 1250 property for purposes of this paragraph where, with respect to each such item:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The period for which depreciation is taken begins on the same date, (ii) the same estimated useful life has continually been used for purposes of taking depreciation or amortization, and (iii) the same method (and rate) of depreciation or amortization has continually been used. For example, assume a taxpayer constructed a 40-unit rental townhouse development and began taking declining balance depreciation on all 40 units as of January 1, 1970, at a uniform rate and has consistently taken depreciation on all 40 units on this same basis. Although each townhouse is a separate item of section 1250 property, all 40 townhouses may be treated as one item of section 1250 property for purposes of the minimum tax since the conditions of subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph are met. This would be true even if the 40 townhouses comprised two 20-unit developments located apart from each other. However, if the taxpayer constructed an additional development or new section on the existing development for which he began taking depreciation on July 1, 1970, at a uniform rate for all the additional units, the additional units and the original units may not be treated as one item of section 1250 property since the condition of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is not met. Where a portion of an item of section 1250 property has been depreciated or amortized under a method (or rate) which is different from the method (or rate) under which the other portion or portions of such item have been depreciated or amortized, such portion is considered a separate item of section 1250 property for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allowable depreciation or amortization. The phrase ``deduction allowable for the taxable year for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, or amortization'' and references in this paragraph to ``allowable depreciation or amortization'' include deductions allowable for the taxable year under sections 162, 167, 212, or 611 for the depreciation or amortization of section 1250 property. Such phrase does not include depreciation allowable in the year in which the section 1250 property is disposed of. For the determination of ``allowable depreciation or amortization'' for taxable years in which the taxpayer has taken no deduction, see Sec.  1.1016-3(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Straight line depreciation. (i) For purposes of computing the depreciation which would have been allowable for the taxable year if the taxpayer had depreciated the property under the straight line method for each taxable year of its useful life, the taxpayer must use the same useful life and salvage value as was used for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer depreciated or amortized the property (subject to redeterminations made pursuant to Sec.  1.167(a)-1 (b) and (c)). If, however, for any taxable year, no useful life was used under the method of depreciation or amortization used or an artificial period was used, such as, for example, by application of section 167(k), or salvage value was not taken into account in determining the annual allowances, such as, for example, under the declining balance method, then, for purposes of computing the depreciation which would have been allowable under

the straight line method for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There is to be used the useful life and salvage value which would have been proper if depreciation had actually been determined under the straight line method (without reference to an artificial life) throughout the period the property was held, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such useful life and such salvage value is to be determined by taking into account for each taxable year the same facts and circumstances as would have been taken into account if the taxpayer had used such method throughout the period the property was held.

If an election under Sec.  1.167(a)-11(f), Sec.  1.167(a)-12(e), or Sec.  1.167(a)-12(f) is applicable to the property, the salvage value of the property shall be determined in accordance with such election, and the asset depreciation period (or asset guideline period) applicable to the property pursuant to such election shall be considered to be the useful life of the property for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the taxpayer acquires property in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies or from another member of an affiliated group during a consolidated return year and an ``accelerated'' method of depreciation as described in section 167(b) (2), (3), or (4) or section 167(j)(1) (B) or (C) is permitted (see Sec.  1.381(c)(6)-1 and Sec.  1.1502-12(g)), the depreciation which would have been allowable under the straight line method is determined as if the property had been depreciated under the straight line method since depreciation was first taken on the property by the transferor of such property. In such cases, references in this paragraph to the period for which the property is held or useful life of the property are treated as including the period beginning with the commencement of the original use of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of section 57(a)(2), the straight line method includes the method of depreciation described in Sec.  1.167(b)-1 or any other method which provides for a uniform proration of the cost or other basis (less salvage value) of the property over the estimated useful life of the property to the taxpayer (in terms of years, hours of use, or other similar time units) or estimated number of units to be produced over the life of the property to the taxpayer. If a method other than the method described in Sec.  1.167(b)-1 is used, the estimated useful life or estimated units of production shall be determined in a manner consistent with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of property constructed by or improvements made by a lessee, the useful life is to be determined in accordance with Sec.  1.167(a)-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application for partial period. If an item is section 1250 property for less than the entire taxable year, the allowable depreciation or amortization includes only the depreciation or amortization for that portion of the taxable year during which the item is section 1250 property and the amount of the depreciation which would have been allowable under the straight line method is determined only with regard to such portion of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No section 1250 and basis adjustment. No adjustment is to be made as a result of the minimum tax either to the basis of section 1250 property or with respect to computations under section 1250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Example. The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The taxpayer's only item of section 1250 property is an office building with respect to which operations were commenced on January 1, 1971. The taxpayer depreciates the component parts of the building on the declining balance method. The useful life and costs of the component parts for depreciation purposes are as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Salvage</p><p class="depth0">Asset                Useful life      Cost        value------------------------------------------------------------------------Building shell...................           50     $400,000      $50,000Partitions and walls.............           10       40,000Ceilings.........................           10       20,000Electrical system................           25       40,000        2,500Heating and air-conditioning                25       60,000        2,500</p><p class="depth0">system..........................------------------------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of computing the item of tax preference under this paragraph for the taxpayer, the partitions, walls, and ceilings may be grouped together and the electrical, heating, and air-conditioning systems may be grouped together since the period for which depreciation is taken began with respect to the assets within these two groups on the

same date and the assets within each group have continually had the same useful life and have continually been depreciated under the same method (and rate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The taxpayer's 1971 item of tax preference under this paragraph would be determined as follows:

Section 57(a)(3) provides that, with respect to each item of section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) which is the subject of a net lease for the taxable year, there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year for depreciation or amortization exceeds the deduction which would have been allowable for the taxable year if the taxpayer had depreciated the property under the straight line method for each year of its useful life for which the taxpayer has held the property. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the determination of the excess under section 57(a)(3) is made with respect to each separate item of section 1245 property. Accordingly, where the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable with respect to one item of section 1245 property if the taxpayer had originally used the straight line method exceeds the allowable depreciation or amortization with respect to such property, such excess may not be used to reduce the amount of the item of tax preference resulting from another item of section 1245 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the determination of the excess under section 57(a)(3) is made with respect to each separate item of section 1245 property. Accordingly, where the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable with respect to one item of section 1245 property if the taxpayer had originally used the straight line method exceeds the allowable depreciation or amortization with respect to such property, such excess may not be used to reduce the amount of the item of tax preference resulting from another item of section 1245 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate items of property. The determination of what constitutes a separate item of section 1245 property must be made on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Such determination shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles expressed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allowable depreciation or amortization. The phrase ``deduction allowable for the taxable year for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, or amortization'' and references in this paragraph to ``allowable depreciation or amortization'' include deductions allowable for the taxable year under sections 162, 167 (including depreciation allowable under section 167 by reason of section 179), 169, 184, 185, 212, or 611 for the depreciation or amortization of section 1245 property. Such phrase does not include depreciation allowable in the year in which the section 1245 property is disposed of. Amortization of certified pollution control facilities under section 169, and amortization of railroad rolling stock under section 184 are not to be treated as amortization

for purposes of section 57(a)(3) to the extent such amounts are treated as an item of tax preference under section 57(a) (4) or (5) (see paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section). For the determination of ``allowable depreciation or amortization'' for taxable years in which the taxpayer has taken no deduction, see Sec.  1.1016-3(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Straight line method of depreciation. The determination of the depreciation which would have been allowable under the straight line method shall be made in a manner consistent with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

Section 57(a)(3) applies only if the section 1245 property is the subject of a net lease for all or part of the taxable year. See Sec.  1.57-3 for the determination of when an item is considered the subject of a net lease. p</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> No section 1245 and basis adjustment.

Section 57(a)(3) does not apply to a corporation other than an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)) and a personal holding company (as defined in section 542).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amortization of certified pollution control facilities--(1) In general. Section 57(a)(4) provides that, with respect to each certified pollution control facility for which an election is in effect under section 169, there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year under such section exceeds the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167. The determination under section 57(a)(4) is made with respect to each separate certified pollution control facility. Accordingly, where the amount of the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 with respect to one facility exceeds the allowable amortization deduction under section 169 with respect to such facility, such excess may not be used to offset an item of tax preference resulting from another facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 57(a)(4) provides that, with respect to each certified pollution control facility for which an election is in effect under section 169, there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year under such section exceeds the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167. The determination under section 57(a)(4) is made with respect to each separate certified pollution control facility. Accordingly, where the amount of the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 with respect to one facility exceeds the allowable amortization deduction under section 169 with respect to such facility, such excess may not be used to offset an item of tax preference resulting from another facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate facilities. The determination of what constitutes a separate facility must be made on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Generally, each facility with respect to which a separate election is in effect under section 169 shall be treated as a separate facility for purposes of this paragraph. However, if the depreciation or amortization which would have been allowable without regard to section 169 with respect to any part of a facility is based on a different useful life, date placed in service, or method of depreciation or amortization from the other part or parts of such facility, such part is considered a separate facility for purposes of this paragraph. For example, if a building constitutes a certified pollution control facility and various component parts of the building have different useful lives, each group of component parts with the same useful life would be treated as a separate facility for purposes of this paragraph. Two or more facilities may be treated as one facility for purposes of this paragraph where, with respect to each such facility: (i) The initial amortization under section 169 commences on the same date, (ii) the facility is placed in service on the same date, (iii) the estimated useful life which would be the basis for depreciation or amortization other than under section 169 has continually been the same, and (iv) the method of depreciation or amortization which could have been used without regard to section 169 could have continually been the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount allowable under section 169. For purposes of the determination of

the amount of the deduction allowable under section 169, see section 169 and the regulations thereunder. Such amount, however, does not include amortization allowable in the year in which the pollution control facility is disposed of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Otherwise allowable deduction. (i) The determination of the amount of the depreciation deduction otherwise allowable under section 167 is made as if the taxpayer had depreciated the property under section 167 for each year of its useful life for which the property has been held. This amount may be determined under Sec.  1.167(a)-(11)(c) if the property is eligible property (as defined in Sec.  1.167(a)-11(b)(2)) and, during the taxable year in which the property was first placed in service, the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Has made an election under Sec.  1.167(a)-11(f) with respect to eligible property first placed in service in such taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Has placed no eligible property in service other than property described in Sec.  1.167(a)-11(b)(5) (iii), (iv), or (v).
The amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be determined as if the taxpayer had depreciated the property in accordance with Sec.  1.167(a)-11 for all years to which such section applies and during which the taxpayer held the property. This amount may be determined under Sec.  1.167(a)-12(a)(5) if the property is qualified property (as defined in Sec.  1.167(a)-12(a)(3)) and the taxpayer has made an election with respect to such property under Sec.  1.167(a)-12(e). If the taxpayer has made an election under Sec.  1.167(a)-12(f)(1) for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1971, this amount shall be determined for such year in accordance with such election. For purposes of this determination, any method selected by the taxpayer which would have been permissible under section 167 for such taxable year, including accelerated methods, may be used. Any additional amount which would have been allowable by reason of section 179 (relating to additional first-year depreciation for small business) may be included provided such amount is reflected in the determination made under this paragraph in subsequent years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a deduction for depreciation has not been taken by the taxpayer in any taxable year under section 167 with respect to the facility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There is to be used the useful life and salvage value which would have been proper under section 167.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such useful life and salvage value is determined by taking into account for each taxable year the same facts and circumstances as would have been taken into account if the taxpayer had used such method throughout the period the property has been held, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date the property is placed in service is, for purposes of this section, deemed to be the first day of the first month for which the amortization deduction is taken with respect to the facility under section 169.
If, prior to the date amortization begins under section 169, a deduction for depreciation has been taken by the taxpayer in any taxable year under section 167 with respect to the facility, the useful life, salvage value, etc., used for that purpose is deemed to be the appropriate useful life, salvage value, etc., for purposes of this paragraph, with such adjustments as are appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances which would have been taken into account since the time the last such depreciation deduction was taken, unless it is established by clear and convincing evidence that some other useful life, salvage value, or date the property is placed in service is more appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of section 57(a)(4) and this paragraph, if the deduction for amortization or depreciation which would have been allowable had no election been made under section 169 would have been--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An amortization deduction based on the term of a leasehold or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A depreciation deduction determined by reference to section 611,

The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A calendar year taxpayer has a certified pollution control facility on which an election is in effect under section 169 commencing with January 1, 1971. No part of the facility is section 1250 property. The original basis of the facility is $100,000 of which $75,000 constitutes amortizable basis. The useful life of the facility is 20 years.

(i) For purposes of this paragraph, the determination of the amount which would have been allowable had the institution maintained its reserve for bad debts on the basis of actual experience is the amount determined under section 585(b)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder. For this purpose, the beginning balance for the first taxable year ending in 1970 is the amount which bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year as (a) the total bad debts sustained during the 5 preceding taxable years, adjusted for recoveries of bad debts during such period, bears to (b) the sum of the loans outstanding at the close of such 5 taxable years. The taxpayer may, however, select a more appropriate balance based on its actual experience during a shorter period subject to the approval of the district director upon examination of the return provided there are unusual circumstances which indicate that such period is more indicative of the taxpayer's actual loss experience. Any such selection and approval shall be made in a manner consistent with the selection and approval of a bad debt reserve method under Sec.  1.166-1(b). In the case of an institution which has been in existence for less than 5 taxable years as of the beginning of the first taxable year ending in 1970, the above formula for determining the beginning balance is applied by substituting the number of taxable years for which the institution has been in existence as of the beginning of the taxable year for ``5'' each time it appears. If any taxable year utilized in the above formula for determining the beginning balance is a short taxable year the amount of the bad debts, adjusted for recoveries, for such taxable year is modified by dividing such amount by the number of days in the taxable year and multiplying the resulting amount by 365. The beginning balance for any subsequent taxable year is the amount of the beginning balance of the preceding taxable year, decreased by bad debt losses during such year, increased by recoveries of bad debts during such year and increased by the lower of the maximum amount determined under section 585(b)(3)(A) for such year or the amount of the deduction allowed for such year. The application of this subdivision (i) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The Y Bank, a calendar year taxpayer, uses the reserve method of acounting for bad debts. On December 31, 1969, Y determines the balance of its reserve for bad debts to be $70,000 under the percentage method. On the same date Y's 5-year moving average is $52,000. Y incurs net bad debt losses (bad debt losses less recoveries of bad debts) of $3,000 for each of the years 1970, 1971, and 1972, which it charges to its reserve for bad debts. Y's 6-year moving averages computed under section 585(b)(3)(A) at the close of 1970, 1971, and 1972 are $50,000, $49,000, and $51,000, respectively.

For this purpose, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, the taxpayer's net long-term capital gain does not include an amount equal to the deduction allowable under section 163 (relating to interest expense) by reason of subsection (d)(1)(C) of that section, and the excess described in the preceding sentence is reduced by an amount equal to the reduction of disallowed interest expense by reason of section 163(d)(2)(B). Furthermore, the net long-term capital gain of an estate or trust does not include capital gains described in section 642(c)(4). Included in the computation of the taxpayer's capital gains item of tax preference are amounts reportable by the taxpayer as distributive shares of gain or loss from partnerships, estates or trusts, electing small business corporations, common trust funds, etc. See section 58 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the above entities.</p><p class="depth0">Example. For 1971, A, a calendar year individual taxpayer, recognized $50,000 from the sale of securities held for more than 6 months. In addition, A received a $15,000 dividend from X Fund, a regulated investment company, $12,000 of which was designated as a capital gain dividend by the company pursuant to section 852(b)(3)(C). The AB partnership recognized a gain of $20,000 from the sale of section 1231 property held by the partnership. The AB partnership agreement provides that A is entitled to 50 percent of the income and gains of the partnership. A had net short-term capital loss for the year of $10,000. A's 1971 capital gains item of tax preference is computed as follows:
Capital gain recognized from securities.....................     $50,000Capital gain dividend from regulated investment company.....      12,000Distributive share of partnership capital gain..............      10,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total net long-term capital gain........................      72,000Less: net short-term capital loss...........................

(i) Section 57(a)(9)(B) provides that in the case of corporations there is to be included as an item

of tax preference with respect to a corporation's net section 1201 gain an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss by a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate under section 11 minus the alternative tax rate under section 1201(a) for the taxable year, and the denominator of the fraction is the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate under section 11 for the taxable year. Included in the above computation are amounts reportable by the taxpayer as distributive shares of gain or loss from partnerships, estates or trusts, common trust funds, etc. In certain cases the amount of the net section 1201 gain which results in preferential treatment will be less than the amount determined by application of the statutory formula. Therefore, in lieu of the statutory formula, the capital gains item of tax preference for corporations may in all cases be determined by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount of tax which would have been imposed under section 11 if section 1201(a) did not apply minus--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the taxes actually imposed

In case of foreign source capital gains and losses which are not taken into account pursuant to sections 58(g)(2)(B) and 1.58-8, the amount determined in the preceding sentence shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the corporation's net section 1201 gain without regard to such gains and losses which are not taken into account and the denominator of which is the corporation's net section 1201 gain.
