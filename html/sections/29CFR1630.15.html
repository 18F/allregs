                            <p class="depth0">Defenses to an allegation of discrimination under this part may  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disparate treatment charges. It may be a defense to a charge of  disparate treatment brought under Sec. Sec. 1630.4 through 1630.8 and  1630.11 through 1630.12 that the challenged action is justified by a  legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charges of discriminatory application of selection criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In general. It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination, as  described in Sec. 1630.10, that an alleged application of qualification  standards, tests, or selection criteria that screens out or tends to  screen out or otherwise denies a job or benefit to an individual with a  disability has been shown to be job-related and consistent with business  necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished with reasonable  accommodation, as required in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct threat as a qualification standard. The term  ``qualification standard'' may include a requirement that an individual  shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual  or others in the workplace. (See Sec. 1630.2(r) defining direct  threat.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other disparate impact charges. It may be a defense to a charge  of discrimination brought under this part that a uniformly applied  standard, criterion, or policy has a disparate impact   on an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with  disabilities that the challenged standard, criterion or policy has been  shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such  performance cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodation, as  required in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Charges of not making reasonable accommodation. It may be a  defense to a charge of discrimination, as described in Sec. 1630.9,  that a requested or necessary accommodation would impose an undue  hardship on the operation of the covered entity's business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conflict with other Federal laws. It may be a defense to a  charge of discrimination under this part that a challenged action is  required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that  another Federal law or regulation prohibits an action (including the  provision of a particular reasonable accommodation) that would otherwise  be required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Claims based on transitory and minor impairments under the  ``regarded as'' prong. It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination  by an individual claiming coverage under the ``regarded as'' prong of  the definition of disability that the impairment is (in the case of an  actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment)  ``transitory and minor.'' To establish this defense, a covered entity  must demonstrate that the impairment is both ``transitory'' and  ``minor.'' Whether the impairment at issue is or would be ``transitory  and minor'' is to be determined objectively. A covered entity may not  defeat ``regarded as'' coverage of an individual simply by demonstrating  that it subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor;  rather, the covered entity must demonstrate that the impairment is (in  the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a  perceived impairment) both transitory and minor. For purposes of this  section, ``transitory'' is defined as lasting or expected to last six  months or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional defenses. It may be a defense to a charge of  discrimination under this part that the alleged discriminatory action is  specifically permitted by Sec. 1630.14 or Sec. 1630.16.  [56 FR 35734, July 26, 1991, as amended at 76 FR 17003, Mar. 25, 2011]</p>
