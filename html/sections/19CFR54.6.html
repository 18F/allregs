                            <p class="depth0">Articles predominating by weight of metal, described in Sec.  54.5(a) shall be admitted free of duty upon compliance with the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There shall be filed in connection with the entry a statement of  the importer consistent with the requirements of Sec. 10.134 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the articles are entered for consumption or warehouse, a bond  shall be filed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set  forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter. Withdrawals from warehouse shall  be made on Customs Form 7501. The liquidation of the consumption or  warehouse entry shall be suspended pending proof of use or other  disposition of the articles within the time prescribed in paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 3 years from the date of entry, or withdrawal from  warehouse for consumption, the importer shall submit to the director of  the port of entry, a statement from the superintendent or manager of the  plant at which the articles were used in remanufacture by melting, or  were processed by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing  which rendered them fit only for the recovery of the metal content,  showing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and location of the plant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entry number, date, and port of entry (if the person making  the statement is not in possession of this information, a reference to  invoices, purchase orders, or other documents which will identify the  shipment with the entry may be substituted);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date or inclusive dates of the remanufacture or processing  of the articles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the remanufacture or processing in sufficient  detail to enable the port director to determine whether it constituted a  use in remanufacture by melting, or processing by shredding, shearing,  compacting, or similar processing which rendered the articles fit only  for the recovery of the metal content. In appropriate cases, the  remanufacture or processing of the articles covered by more than one  entry may be included in one statement. The statement shall be based on  adequate and carefully kept plant and import records which shall be  available during normal business hours to any Customs officer. The   importer and plant manager shall maintain the import and plant records  for 5 years from the date of the related entry of the merchandise. The  burden shall be on the importer or plant manager to keep these records  so that the claim of actual use can be established readily.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If satisfactory proof of use of the articles in remanufacture by  melting, or in processing by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar  processing which rendered them fit only for the recovery of the metal  content, is furnished within the prescribed time, the entry shall be  liquidated without the assessment of duty on the covered articles. If  proof is not filed within 3 years from the date of entry, or withdrawal  from warehouse for consumption, or the use does not warrant the  classification claimed, the entry shall be liquidated without any  exemption from duty under subheading 9817.00.80 or 9817.00.90, HTSUS.  As used in this section, the phrase ``in connection with the entry''  means any time before liquidation of the entry or within the period  during which a reliquidation may be completed (Sec. 113.43(c)).  Therefore, a claim for free entry under subheading 9817.00.80 or  9817.00.90, HTSUS, supported by a statement of intent may be filed at  any time before liquidation of the entry or within the period during  which a valid reliquidation may be completed.  (R.S. 251, as amended, secs. 623, as amended, 624, 46 Stat. 759, as  amended (19 U.S.C. 66, 1623, 1624))  [T.D. 80-151, 45 FR 38041, June 6, 1980, as amended by T.D. 84-213, 49  FR 41170, Oct. 19, 1984; T.D. 87-75, 52 FR 20067, May 29, 1987; T.D. 89- 1, 53 FR 51255, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 95-81, 60 FR 52295, Oct. 6, 1995]</p>
