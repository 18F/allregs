                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contract requirements. Prior to donated foods being made  available to a food service management company, the recipient agency  must enter into a contract with the food service management company. The  contract must ensure that all donated foods received for use by the  recipient agency for a period specified as either the school year or  fiscal year are used in the recipient agency's food service. Contracts  between recipient agencies in child nutrition programs and food service  management companies must also ensure compliance with other requirements  in this subpart relating to donated foods, as well as other Federal  requirements in 7 CFR parts 210, 220, 225, or 226, as   applicable. Contracts between other recipient agencies--i.e., charitable  institutions and recipient agencies utilizing TEFAP foods--and food  service management companies are not subject to the other requirements  in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of contracts. Recipient agencies may enter into a fixed- price or a cost-reimbursable contract with a food service management  company, except that recipient agencies in CACFP are prohibited from  entering into cost-reimbursable contracts, in accordance with 7 CFR part  226. Under a fixed-price contract, the recipient agency pays a fixed  cost per meal provided or a fixed cost for a certain time period. Under  a cost-reimbursable contract, the food service management company  charges the recipient agency for food service operating costs, and also  charges fixed fees for management or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procurement requirements. The recipient agency must meet  Departmental procurement requirements in 7 CFR parts 3016 or 3019, as  applicable, in obtaining the services of a food service management  company, as well as applicable requirements in 7 CFR parts 210, 220,  225, or 226. The recipient agency must ensure that procurement  documents, as well as contract provisions, include any donated food  activities that a food service management company is to perform, such as  those activities listed in paragraph (d) of this section. The  procurement and contract must also specify the method used to determine  the donated food values to be used in crediting, or the actual values  assigned, in accordance with Sec. 250.51. The method used to determine  the donated food values may not be established through a post-award  negotiation, or by any other method that may directly or indirectly  alter the terms and conditions of the procurement or contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, in accordance with procurement  documents and its contract with the recipient agency. Such activities  may also include the procurement of processed end products on behalf of  the recipient agency. Such procurement must ensure compliance with the  requirements in subpart C of this part and with the provisions of the  distributing or recipient agency's processing agreements, and must  ensure crediting of the recipient agency for the value of donated foods  contained in such end products at the processing agreement value.  Although the food service management company may procure processed end  products on behalf of the recipient agency, it may not itself enter into  the processing agreement with the processor required in subpart C of  this part. Other donated food activities that the food service  management company may perform include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preparing and serving meals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ordering or selection of donated foods, in coordination with the  recipient agency, and in accordance with Sec. 250.58(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Storage and inventory management of donated foods, in accordance  with Sec. 250.52; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment of processing fees or submittal of refund requests to a  processor on behalf of the recipient agency, or remittance of refunds  for the value of donated foods in processed end products to the  recipient agency, in accordance with the requirements in subpart C of  this part.</p>
