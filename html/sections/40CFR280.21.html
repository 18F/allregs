                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Alternatives allowed. Not later than December 22, 1998, all  existing UST systems must comply with one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New UST system performance standards under Sec.  280.20;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The upgrading requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Closure requirements under subpart G of this part, including  applicable requirements for corrective action under subpart F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tank upgrading requirements. Steel tanks must be upgraded to  meet one of the following requirements in accordance with a code of  practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent  testing laboratory:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interior lining. A tank may be upgraded by internal lining if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lining is installed in accordance with the requirements of  Sec.  280.33, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 10 years after lining, and every 5 years thereafter, the  lined tank is internally inspected and found to be structurally sound  with the lining still performing in accordance with original design  specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (ii), (iii), and (iv) and the integrity of the tank  is ensured using one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The tank is internally inspected and assessed to ensure that the  tank is structurally sound and free of corrosion holes prior to  installing the cathodic protection system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The tank has been installed for less than 10 years and is  monitored   monthly for releases in accordance with Sec.  280.43 (d) through (h); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The tank has been installed for less than 10 years and is  assessed for corrosion holes by conducting two (2) tightness tests that  meet the requirements of Sec.  280.43(c). The first tightness test must  be conducted prior to installing the cathodic protection system. The  second tightness test must be conducted between three (3) and six (6)  months following the first operation of the cathodic protection system;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The tank is assessed for corrosion holes by a method that is  determined by the implementing agency to prevent releases in a manner  that is no less protective of human health and the environment than  paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Internal lining combined with cathodic protection. A tank may be  upgraded by both internal lining and cathodic protection if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lining is installed in accordance with the requirements of  Sec.  280.33; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, (iii), and (iv).</p><p class="depth4">Note: The following codes and standards may be used to comply with  this section:</p><p class="depth5"><em>(A)</em> American Petroleum Institute Publication 1631, ``Recommended  Practice for the Interior Lining of Existing Steel Underground Storage  Tanks'';</p><p class="depth5"><em>(B)</em> National Leak Prevention Association Standard 631, ``Spill  Prevention, Minimum 10 Year Life Extension of Existing Steel Underground  Tanks by Lining Without the Addition of Cathodic Protection'';</p><p class="depth5"><em>(C)</em> National Association of Corrosion Engineers Standard RP-02-85,  ``Control of External Corrosion on Metallic Buried, Partially Buried, or  Submerged Liquid Storage Systems''; and</p><p class="depth5"><em>(D)</em> American Petroleum Institute Publication 1632, ``Cathodic  Protection of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks and Piping Systems.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Piping upgrading requirements. Metal piping that routinely  contains regulated substances and is in contact with the ground must be  cathodically protected in accordance with a code of practice developed  by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory  and must meet the requirements of Sec.  280.20(b)(2) (ii), (iii), and  (iv).</p><p class="depth2">Note: The codes and standards listed in the note following Sec.   280.20(b)(2) may be used to comply with this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Spill and overfill prevention equipment. To prevent spilling and  overfilling associated with product transfer to the UST system, all  existing UST systems must comply with new UST system spill and overfill  prevention equipment requirements specified in Sec.  280.20(c).</p>
