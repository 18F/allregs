                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each existing tank system that does not have secondary containment meeting the requirements of Sec. 265.193, the owner or operator must determine that the tank system is not leaking or is unfit for use. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator must obtain and keep on file at the facility a written assessment reviewed and certified by a qualified Professional Engineer in accordance with Sec. 270.11(d) of this chapter, that attests to the tank system's integrity by January 12, 1988.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This assessment must determine that the tank system is adequately designed and has sufficient structural strength and compatibility with the waste(s) to be stored or treated to ensure that it will not collapse, rupture, or fail. At a minimum, this assessment must consider the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design standard(s), if available, according to which the tank and ancillary equipment were constructed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hazardous characteristics of the waste(s) that have been or will be handled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Existing corrosion protection measures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documented age of the tank system, if available, (otherwise, an estimate of the age); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Results of a leak test, internal inspection, or other tank integrity examination such that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For non-enterable underground tanks, this assessment must consist of a leak test that is capable of taking into account the effects of temperature variations, tank end deflection, vapor pockets, and high water table effects,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For other than non-enterable underground tanks and for ancillary equipment, this assessment must be either a leak test, as described above, or an internal inspection and/or other tank integrity examination certified by a qualified Professional Engineer in accordance with Sec. 270.11(d) of this chapter that addresses cracks, leaks, corrosion, and erosion.
[Note: The practices described in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Publication, Guide for Inspection of Refinery Equipment, Chapter XIII, ``Atmospheric and Low-Pressure Storage Tanks,'' 4th edition, 1981, may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in conducting the integrity examination of an other than non-enterable underground tank system.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tank systems that store or treat materials that become hazardous wastes subsequent to July 14, 1986 must conduct this assessment within 12 months after the date that the waste becomes a hazardous waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, as a result of the assessment conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, a tank system is found to be leaking or unfit for use, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements of Sec. 265.196.
