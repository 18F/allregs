                                Sec. 825.215  Equivalent position.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equivalent position. An equivalent position is one that is  virtually identical to the employee's former position in terms of pay,  benefits and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites and  status. It must involve the same or substantially similar duties and  responsibilities, which must entail substantially equivalent skill,  effort, responsibility, and authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions to qualify. If an employee is no longer qualified for  the position because of the employee's inability to attend a necessary  course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, etc., as a  result of the leave, the employee shall be given a reasonable  opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon return to work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equivalent pay. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee is entitled to any unconditional  pay increases which may have occurred during the FMLA leave period, such  as cost of living increases. Pay increases conditioned upon seniority,  length of service, or work performed must be granted in accordance with  the employer's policy or practice with respect to other employees on an  equivalent leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA  leave. An employee is entitled to be restored to a position with the  same or equivalent pay premiums, such as a shift differential. If an  employee departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and  corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is ordinarily  entitled to such a position on return from FMLA leave.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether it is  discretionary or non-discretionary, made to employees consistent with  the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if a bonus  or other payment is based on the achievement of a specified goal such as  hours worked, products sold or perfect attendance, and the employee has  not met the goal due to FMLA leave, then the payment may be denied,  unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent leave status for a  reason that does not qualify as FMLA leave. For example, if an employee  who used paid vacation leave for a non-FMLA purpose would receive the  payment, then the employee who used paid vacation leave for an FMLA- protected purpose also must receive the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equivalent benefits. Benefits include all benefits provided or  made available to employees by an employer, including group life  insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, sick leave, annual  leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such  benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employer  through an employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must be resumed  in the same manner and at the same levels as provided when the leave  began, and subject to any changes in benefit levels that may have taken  place during the period of FMLA leave affecting the entire workforce,  unless otherwise elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave,  an employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the  employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or dependent  coverages). For example, if an employee was covered by a life insurance  policy before taking leave but is not covered or coverage lapses during  the period of unpaid FMLA leave, the employee cannot be required to meet  any qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in order to  requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. Accordingly, some  employers may find it necessary to modify life insurance and other  benefits programs in order to restore employees to equivalent benefits  upon return from FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of  costs to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay these  costs subject to recovery from the employee on return from leave. See  Sec. 825.213(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any additional  benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. Benefits accrued at the  time leave began, however, (e.g., paid vacation, sick or personal leave  to the extent not substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an  employee upon return from leave.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to continue  life insurance, disability insurance, or other types of benefits for  which he or she typically pays, the employer is required to follow  established policies or practices for continuing such benefits for other  instances of leave without pay. If the employer has no established  policy, the employee and the employer are encouraged to agree upon  arrangements before FMLA leave begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any period  of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or counted toward a break  in service for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate. Also,  if the plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific date in  order to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions  or participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on that date  shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. However, unpaid FMLA  leave periods need not be treated as credited service for purposes of  benefit accrual, vesting and eligibility to participate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if they  continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit plans. They are  entitled to changes in benefits plans, except those which may be  dependent upon seniority or accrual during the leave period, immediately  upon return from leave or to the same extent they would have qualified  if no leave had been taken. For example, if the benefit plan is  predicated on a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the  employee   does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking unpaid FMLA leave,  the benefit is lost. (In this regard, Sec. 825.209 addresses health  benefits.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equivalent terms and conditions of employment. An equivalent  position must have substantially similar duties, conditions,  responsibilities, privileges and status as the employee's original  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee must be reinstated to the same or a geographically  proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not involve a significant  increase in commuting time or distance) from where the employee had  previously been employed. If the employee's original worksite has been  closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if the employee  had not been on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an  employer transfers all employees from a closed worksite to a new  worksite in a different city, the employee on leave is also entitled to  transfer under the same conditions as if he or she had continued to be  employed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift  or the same or an equivalent work schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee must have the same or an equivalent opportunity for  bonuses, profit-sharing, and other similar discretionary and non- discretionary payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FMLA does not prohibit an employer from accommodating an  employee's request to be restored to a different shift, schedule, or  position which better suits the employee's personal needs on return from  leave, or to offer a promotion to a better position. However, an  employee cannot be induced by the employer to accept a different  position against the employee's wishes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> De minimis exception. The requirement that an employee be  restored to the same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay,  benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not extend to de  minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable aspects of the job.</p>
