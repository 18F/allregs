                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The requirements of this section shall govern the installation of all liquid fuel piping attached to any manufactured home. None of the requirements listed in this section shall apply to the piping in the appliance(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Materials. All materials used for the installation extension, alteration,

or repair, of any oil piping systems shall be new and free from defects or internal obstructions. The system shall be made of materials having a melting point of not less than 1,450 F, except as provided in Sec. 280.706(d) and (e). They shall consist of one or more of the materials described in Sec. 3280.706(b) (1) through (4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Steel or wrought-iron pipe shall comply with ANSI B 36.10-1979, Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe. Threaded copper or brass pipe in iron pipe sizes may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fittings for oil piping shall be wrought-iron, malleable iron, steel, or brass (containing not more than 75 percent copper).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copper tubing must be annealed type, Grade K or L conforming to the Standard Specification for Seamless Copper Water Tube, ASTM B88-93, or shall comply with ASTM B280-1995, Standard Specification for Seamless Copper Tube for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Field Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Steel tubing shall have a minimum wall thickness of 0.032 inch for diameters up to \1/2\ inch and 0.049 inch for diameters \1/2\ inch and larger. Steel tubing shall be constructed in accordance with the Specification for Electric-Resistance-Welded Coiled Steel Tubing for Gas and Field Oil Lines, ASTM, A539-90a, and shall be externally corrosion protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Size of oil piping. The minimum size of all fuel oil tank piping connecting outside tanks to the appliance shall be no smaller than \3/8\ inch OD copper tubing or \1/4\ inch IPS. If No. 1 fuel oil is used with a listed automatic pump (fuel lifter), copper tubing shall be sized as specified by the pump manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joints for oil piping. All pipe joints in the piping system, unless welded or brazed, shall be threaded joints which comply with ANSI/ASME B1.20.1-1983, Pipe Threads, General Purpose (Inch). The material used for brazing pipe connections shall have a melting temperature in excess of 1,000 F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Joints for tubing. Joints in tubing shall be made with either a single or double flare of the proper degree, as recommended by the tubing manufacturer, by means of listed tubing fittings, or brazed with materials having a melting point in excess of 1,000 F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pipe joint compound. Threaded joints shall be made up tight with listed pipe joint compound which shall be applied to the male threads only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Couplings. Pipe couplings and unions shall be used to join sections of threaded pipe. Right and left nipples or couplings shall not be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Grade of piping. Fuel oil piping installed in conjunction with gravity feed systems to oil heating equipment shall slope in a gradual rise upward from a central location to both the oil tank and the appliance in order to eliminate air locks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Strap hangers. All oil piping shall be adequately supported by galvanized or equivalently protected metal straps or hangers at intervals of not more than 4 feet, except where adequate support and protection is provided by structural members. Solid-iron-pipe oil supply connection(s) shall be rigidly anchored to a structural member within 6 inches of the supply connection(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Testing Tag. A tag must be affixed to each oil-fired appliance stating: ``Before setting the system in operation, tank installations and piping must be checked for oil leaks with fuel oil of the same grade that will be burned in the appliance. No other material may be used for testing fuel oil tanks and piping. Tanks must be filled to maximum capacity for the final check for oil leakage.''
