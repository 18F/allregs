                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All animals offered for exportation to any foreign country, except by land to Mexico or Canada, shall be inspected within 24 hours of embarkation by an APHIS veterinarian at an export inspection facility at a port listed as a designated port of embarkation in accordance with Sec. 91.14(a), or at a port or inspection facility designated by the Administrator in a special case under Sec. 91.14(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such animals shall be held for a period of not less than 5 hours at the port of embarkation or export inspection facility during which time the animals shall be given a careful visual health inspection. Sorting, grouping, identification, or other handling of the

animals by the exporter may be before or after this period of time. If individual clinical inspection of an animal is deemed necessary by an APHIS veterinarian for the purpose of determining its health status, such inspection may be made during this period of time or thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Feed and water. All animals shall be allowed a period of at least 5 hours for rest at the export inspection facility, with adequate feed and water available, before movement to an ocean vessel or aircraft for loading for export. (This may be the same period required by paragraph (b) for health inspection.) However, feed and water will not be required if the animals were transported to the export inspection facility in a carrier in which adequate feed and water were provided and if sufficient evidence is presented to an APHIS veterinarian that the animals, if under 30 days of age, will arrive in the country of destination within 24 hours after they were last fed and watered, in the United States, or in the case of other animals within 36 hours after they were last fed and watered in the United States
