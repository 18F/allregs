(1) General. For purposes of determining the number of a PHA's public housing units and the relative modernization needs of PHAs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. For purposes of determining the number of a PHA's public housing units and the relative modernization needs of PHAs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> HUD shall count as one unit:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each public housing and section 23 bond-financed CF unit, except that each existing unit under the Turnkey III program shall count as one-fourth of a unit. Units receiving operating subsidy only shall not be counted.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Each existing unit under the Mutual Help program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HUD shall add to the overall unit count any units that the PHA adds to its inventory when the units are under CF ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the date that HUD establishes for the FFY in which the CF formula is being run (hereafter called the ``reporting date''). New CF units and those reaching DOFA after the reporting date shall be counted for CF formula purposes in the following FFY.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Replacement units. Replacement units newly constructed on or after October 1, 1998, that replace units in a project funded in FFY 1999 by the Comprehensive Grant formula system or the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system shall be given a new CF ACC number as a separate project and shall be treated as a newly constructed development as outlined in Sec. 905.600 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reconfiguration of units. Reconfiguration of units may cause the need to be calculated by the new configuration based on the formula characteristics in the building and unit's PIC module (refer to the formula sections here). The unit counts will be determined by the CF units existing after the reconfiguration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reduction of units. For a project losing units as a result of demolition and disposition, the number of units on which the CF formula is based shall be the number of units reported as eligible for Capital Funds as of the reporting date. Units are eligible for funding until they are removed due to demolition and disposition in accordance with a schedule approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Computation of formula shares under the CF formula. (1) Total estimated existing modernization need. The total estimated existing modernization need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated existing modernization need per unit, as determined by paragraph (d) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated project needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total estimated existing modernization need. The total estimated existing modernization need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated existing modernization need per unit, as determined by paragraph (d) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated project needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total accrual need. The total accrual need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated accrual need per unit, as determined by paragraph (e) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated accrual needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> PHA's formula share of existing modernization need. A PHA's formula share of existing modernization need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated existing modernization need divided by the total existing modernization need of all PHAs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> PHA's formula share of accrual need. A PHA's formula share of accrual need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated accrual need divided by the total existing accrual need of all PHAs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> PHA's formula share of capital need. A PHA's formula share of capital need under the CF formula is the average of the PHA's share of existing modernization need and its share of accrual need (by which method each share is weighted 50 percent).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CF formula capping. (1) For units that are eligible for funding under the CF formula (including replacement housing units discussed below), a PHA's CF formula share shall be its share of capital need, as determined under the CF formula, subject to the condition that no PHA's CF formula share for units funded under the CF formula can be less than 94 percent of its formula share had the FFY 1999 formula system been applied to these CF formula-eligible units. The FFY 1999 formula system is based upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Grant formula system for PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999 and upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system for PHAs with fewer than 250 units in FFY 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For units that are eligible for funding under the CF formula (including replacement housing units discussed below), a PHA's CF formula share shall be its share of capital need, as determined under the CF formula, subject to the condition that no PHA's CF formula share for units funded under the CF formula can be less than 94 percent of its formula share had the FFY 1999 formula system been applied to these CF formula-eligible units. The FFY 1999 formula system is based upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Grant formula system for PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999 and upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system for PHAs with fewer than 250 units in FFY 1999.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a Moving to Work (MTW) PHA whose MTW agreement provides that its CF formula share is to be calculated in accordance with the previously existing formula, the PHA's CF formula share, during the term of the MTW agreement, may be approximately the formula share that the PHA would have received had the FFY 1999 formula funding system been applied to the CF formula eligible units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Replacement Housing Factor to reflect formula need for developments with demolition or disposition occurring on or after October 1, 1998, and prior to September 30, 2013.

PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units attributable to demolition or disposition of units during the period (reflected in data maintained by HUD) that lowers the formula unit count for the CFF calculation qualify for application of an RHF, subject to satisfaction of criteria stated in paragraph (i)(5) of this section</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RHF generally. PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units attributable to demolition or disposition of units during the period (reflected in data maintained by HUD) that lowers the formula unit count for the CFF calculation qualify for application of an RHF, subject to satisfaction of criteria stated in paragraph (i)(5) of this section</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When applied.
