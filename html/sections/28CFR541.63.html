                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Regional Director in the region where the inmate is located  shall review the institution's recommendation for referral of an inmate  for controlled housing status. If the Regional Director concurs with the  recommendation, the Regional Director shall designate a person in the  Regional Office or a person at department head level or above in the  institution to conduct a hearing on the appropriateness of an inmate's  placement in controlled housing status. This Hearing Administrator shall  have correctional experience, no former personal involvement in the  instant situation, and a knowledge of the type of behavior that poses a  health risk to others, and of the options available for dealing with an  inmate who poses such a health risk to others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Hearing Administrator shall provide a hearing to an inmate  recommended for controlled housing status. The hearing ordinarily shall  take place at the institution housing the inmate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The hearing shall proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Staff shall provide an inmate with an advance written notice of  the hearing and a copy of this rule at least 24 hours prior to the  hearing. The notice will advise the inmate of the specific act(s) or  other evidence which forms the basis for a recommendation that the  inmate be placed in a controlled housing status, unless such evidence  would likely endanger staff or others. If an inmate is illiterate, staff  shall explain the notice and this rule to the inmate and document that  this explanation has occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Hearing Administrator shall upon request of the inmate  provide an inmate the service of a full-time staff member to represent  the inmate. The Hearing Administrator shall document in the record of  the hearing an inmate's request for, or refusal of staff representation.  The inmate may select   a staff representative from the local institution. If the selected staff  member declines for good reason or is unavailable, the inmate has the  option of selecting another representative or, in the case of an absent  staff member, of waiting a reasonable period (determined by the Hearing  Administrator) for the staff member's return, or of proceeding without a  staff representative. When an inmate is illiterate, the Warden shall  provide a staff representative. The staff representative shall be  available to assist the inmate and, if the inmate desires, shall contact  witnesses and present favorable evidence at the hearing. The Hearing  Administrator shall afford the staff representative adequate time to  speak with the inmate and to inteview available witnesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The inmate has the right to be present throughout the hearing,  except where institutional security or good order is jeopardized. The  Hearing Adminstrator may conduct a hearing in the absence of the inmate  when the inmate refuses to appear. The Hearing Administrator shall  document an inmate's refusal to appear, or other reason for  nonappearance, in the record of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The inmate is entitled to present documentary evidence and to  have witnesses appear, provided that calling witnesses would not  jeopardize or threaten institutional security or individual safety, and  further provided that the witnesses are available at the institution  where the hearing is being conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The evidence to be presented must be material and relevant to  the issue as to whether the inmate can and would pose a health risk to  others, if allowed to remain in general prison population. This evidence  may come from the statements of the individual, repeated misconduct  (including disciplinary actions), or other behavior suggesting that the  inmate may engage in predatory or promiscuous sexual behavior,  assaultive behavior where body fluids may be transmitted to others, or  the sharing of needles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repetitive witnesses need not be called. Staff who recommend  placement in a controlled housing status are not required to appear,  provided their recommendation is fully explained in the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a witness is not available within the institution, or not  permitted to appear, the inmate may submit a written statement by that  witness. The Hearing Administrator shall, upon the inmate's request,  postpone any decision following the hearing for a reasonable time to  permit the obtaining and forwarding of written statements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Hearing Administrator shall document in the record of the  hearing the reasons for declining to hear a witness or to receive  documentary evidence.
