                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Proposed actions subject to the NEPA requirements. As required  by 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., a Forest Service proposal is subject to the  NEPA requirements when all of the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Forest Service has a goal and is actively preparing to make  a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal  and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated (see 40 CFR 1508.23);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed action is subject to Forest Service control and  responsibility (see 40 CFR 1508.18);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed action would cause effects on the natural and  physical environment and the relationship of people with that  environment (see 40 CFR 1508.14); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposed action is not statutorily exempt from the  requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergency responses. When the responsible official determines  that an emergency exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed  actions before preparing a NEPA analysis and any required documentation  in accordance with the provisions in Sec. Sec. 220.5, 220.6, and 220.7  of this part, then the following provisions apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible official may take actions necessary to control  the immediate impacts of the emergency and are urgently needed to  mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural or cultural  resources. When taking such actions, the responsible official shall take  into account the probable environmental consequences of the emergency  action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the  extent practical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other  than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and  such actions are not likely to have significant environmental impacts,  the responsible official shall document that determination in an EA and  FONSI prepared in accord with these regulations. If the responsible  official finds that the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions  are such that they must be undertaken prior to preparing any NEPA  analysis and documentation associated with a CE or an EA and FONSI, the  responsible official shall consult with the Washington Office about  alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Chief or Associate  Chief of the Forest Service may grant emergency alternative arrangements  under NEPA for environmental assessments, findings of no significant  impact and categorical exclusions (FSM 1950.41a). Consultation with the  Washington Office shall be coordinated through the appropriate regional  office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other  than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and  such actions are likely to have significant environmental impacts, then  the responsible official shall consult with CEQ, through the appropriate  regional office and the Washington Office, about alternative   arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11 as  soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency decisionmaking. For each Forest Service proposal (Sec.  220.4(a)), the responsible official shall coordinate and integrate NEPA  review and relevant environmental documents with agency decisionmaking  by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Completing the environmental document review before making a  decision on the proposal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Considering environmental documents, public and agency comments  (if any) on those documents, and agency responses to those comments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Including environmental documents, comments, and responses in  the administrative record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Considering the alternatives analyzed in environmental  document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Making a decision encompassed within the range of alternatives  analyzed in the environmental documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA). The responsible official  shall ensure the SOPA is updated and notify the public of the  availability of the SOPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Scoping (40 CFR 1501.7). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scoping is required for all Forest  Service proposed actions, including those that would appear to be  categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA  or an EIS (Sec. 220.6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scoping shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements  of 40 CFR 1501.7. Because the nature and complexity of a proposed action  determine the scope and intensity of analysis, no single scoping  technique is required or prescribed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The SOPA shall not to be used as the sole scoping mechanism for  a proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cumulative effects considerations of past actions. Cumulative  effects analysis shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7  and in accordance with ``The Council on Environmental Quality Guidance  Memorandum on Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects  Analysis'' dated June 24, 2005. The analysis of cumulative effects  begins with consideration of the direct and indirect effects on the  environment that are expected or likely to result from the alternative  proposals for agency action. Agencies then look for present effects of  past actions that are, in the judgment of the agency, relevant and  useful because they have a significant cause-and-effect relationship  with the direct and indirect effects of the proposal for agency action  and its alternatives. CEQ regulations do not require the consideration  of the individual effects of all past actions to determine the present  effects of past actions. Once the agency has identified those present  effects of past actions that warrant consideration, the agency assesses  the extent that the effects of the proposal for agency action or its  alternatives will add to, modify, or mitigate those effects. The final  analysis documents an agency assessment of the cumulative effects of the  actions considered (including past, present, and reasonable foreseeable  future actions) on the affected environment. With respect to past  actions, during the scoping process and subsequent preparation of the  analysis, the agency must determine what information regarding past  actions is useful and relevant to the required analysis of cumulative  effects. Cataloging past actions and specific information about the  direct and indirect effects of their design and implementation could in  some contexts be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the  proposal. The CEQ regulations, however, do not require agencies to  catalogue or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions.  Simply because information about past actions may be available or  obtained with reasonable effort does not mean that it is relevant and  necessary to inform decisionmaking. (40 CFR 1508.7)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Classified information. To the extent practicable, the  responsible official shall segregate any information that has been  classified pursuant to Executive order or statute. The responsible  official shall maintain the confidentiality of such information in a  manner required for the information involved. Such information may not  be included in any publicly disclosed documents. If such material cannot  be reasonably segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially  meaningless material, the responsible official must withhold the entire  analysis document   from the public; however, the responsible official shall otherwise  prepare the analysis documentation in accord with applicable  regulations. (40 CFR 1507.3(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Incorporation by reference. Material may be incorporated by  reference into any environmental or decision document. This material  must be reasonably available to the public and its contents briefly  described in the environmental or decision document. (40 CFR 1502.21)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicants. The responsible official shall make policies or  staff available to advise potential applicants of studies or other  information foreseeably required for acceptance of their applications.  Upon acceptance of an application as provided by 36 CFR 251.54(g) the  responsible official shall initiate the NEPA process.</p>
