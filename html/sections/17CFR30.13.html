Any certification of a non-narrow based security index futures contracts submitted under paragraph (a) or (e) of this section shall be considered to be based on the facts and representations contained in the foreign board of trade's submissions to the Commission.

In this context, the foreign board of trade may submit the contract to the Commission for an accelerated review of fifteen business days for confirmation that the subject contract is substantially identical to the existing contract. Unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade within those fifteen business days that the review will be conducted pursuant to either the full or expedited review procedure, the foreign board of trade may make available such contract for offer or sale within the U.S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Grandfathered no-action letters. Any non-narrow based security index futures contract that is the subject of an existing no-action letter issued by the Office of General Counsel, as of the date of the adoption of rule 30.13, shall be deemed to be in conformance with the criteria of section 2(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, provided that the foreign board of trade submits a written statement representing that the contract remains fully compliant with the requirements of such letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Delegation. The Commission hereby delegates, until such time as it orders otherwise, to the Director of Market Oversight or his designee, in consultation with the General Counsel or his designee, the authority reserved to the Commission under paragraph (m) of this section. The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated pursuant to this paragraph (o).

Sec. Appendix A to Part 30--Interpretative Statement With Respect to the</p><p class="depth0">Commission's Exemptive Authority Under Sec. 30.10 of Its Rules</p><p class="depth0">Part 30 of the Commission's regulations establishes the regulatory structure governing the offer and sale in the United States of futures and options contracts made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade. Section 30.10 of these regulations provides that, upon petition, the Commission may exempt any person from any requirement of this part. Specifically, section 30.10 states:</p><p class="depth0">Any person adversely affected by any requirement of this part may file a petition with the Secretary of the Commission, which petition must set forth with particularity the reasons why that person believes that he should be exempt from such requirement. The Commission may, in its discretion, grant such an exemption if that person demonstrates to the Commission's satisfaction that the exemption is not otherwise contrary to the public interest or to the purposes of the provision from which exemption is sought. The petition will be granted or denied on the basis of the papers filed. The petition may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission may find appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">As the provisions of this section make clear, any person subject to regulation under part 30 may petition the Commission for an exemption. In adopting these regulations, however, the Commission noted in particular that persons located outside the United States that solicit or accept orders directly from United States customers for foreign futures or options transactions and that are subject to a comparable regulatory scheme in the country in which they are located may apply under section 30.10 for exemption from some or all of the requirements that would otherwise be applicable to such persons. This interpretative statement sets forth the elements that the Commission intends to evaluate in determining whether a particular regulatory program may be found to be comparable to the Commission's program.</p><p class="depth0">The Commission wishes to emphasize, however, that this interpretative statement is not all inclusive, and that information with respect to other aspects of a particular regulatory program may be submitted by a petitioner or requested by the Commission. In this connection, the Commission would have broad discretion to determine that the policies of any program element generally are met, notwithstanding the fact that the offshore program does not contain an element identical to that of the Commission's regulatory program and conversely may assess how particular elements are in fact applied by offshore authorities. Thus, for example, in order to find that a particular program is comparable, the regulations thereunder would have to be applicable to all United States customers, notwithstanding any exemptions that might otherwise be available to particular classes of customer located offshore. A petitioner, therefore, must set forth with particularity the factual basis for a finding of comparability and the reasons why such policies and purposes are met, notwithstanding differences of degree and kind in its regulatory program.</p><p class="depth0">No exemptions of a general nature will be granted unless the persons to which the exemption is to be applied consent to submit to jurisdiction in the United States by designating an agent for service of process pursuant to the provisions of rule 30.5 with respect to any activities of such persons otherwise subject to regulation under this part and to notify the National Futures Association of the commencement or termination of business in the United States. In this connection, to be exempted, such person must further agree to respond to a request to confirm that it continues to do business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Persons located outside the United States may seek an exemption on their own behalf or an exemption may be sought on a general basis through the governmental agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the regulatory program in question, or the self-regulatory organizations of which such persons are members. The appropriate petitioner is a matter of judgment and may be determined by the parties seeking the exemption. The Commission, however, notes that it will be able to address petitions more efficiently if they are filed by the governmental agency or self-regulatory organization responsible for the regulatory program.</p><p class="depth0">In this connection, as will be discussed in more detail below, any exemption of a general nature based on comparability will be conditioned upon appropriate information sharing arrangements between the Commission and the relevant governmental agency

and/or self-regulatory organization. Representations from the appropriate governmental agency with respect to the applicability of any blocking statutes that may prevent the sharing of information requested under private arrangements would also be considered. Finally, in considering an exemption request, the Commission will take into account the extent to which United States persons or contracts regulated by the Commission are permitted to engage in futures-related activities or be offered in the country from which an exemption is sought.</p><p class="depth0">In the Commission's review, the minimum elements of a comparable regulatory program would include: (1) Registration, authorization or other form of licensing, fitness review or qualification of persons through which customer orders are solicited and accepted; (2) minimum financial requirements for those persons that accept customer funds; (3) protection of customer funds from misapplication; (4) recordkeeping and reporting requirements; (5) minimum sales practice standards, including disclosure of the risks of futures and opotions transactions and, in particular, the risk of transactions undertaken outside the jurisdiction of domestic law; and (6) compliance.</p><p class="depth0">Qualification. Under domestic law, registration identifies to the Commission, the public and other governmental agencies the individuals and entities that are properly authorized to solicit and accept customer orders and are in good standing. Equally important, the procedure provides the Commission, through the National Futures Association, the opportunity to determine whether applicants are unfit to deal with the public. In this connection, the standards for determining whether a person through its principals is fit for registration with the Commission are set forth in section 8a(2)-8a(4) of the Act. Timely access to information as to a firm's good standing and the application by relevant authorities of membership and licensing criteria, as well as the criteria themselves, will be considered by the Commission in assessing comparability.</p><p class="depth0">Minimum Financial Requirements. Minimum financial requirements for persons that handle customer funds serve at least three critical functions. First, they provide a cushion together with margin such that in the event of a default of a customer, the losses of that customer need not adversely affect the funds held on behalf of other customers. Second, they help ensure that the person has sufficient funds to operate its business and, therefore, is less likely to be tempted to misapply customer funds for its own purposes. Third, they ensure that the person holding customer funds has some financial stake in its business and, therefore, is serious in its intent. In assessing comparability, capital rules or their equivalent will be considered together with any provisions made for insuring customer losses, the scope of clearing guarantees and segregation or customer trust calculation and accounting requirements which, to the extent they cover undermargined accounts, can provide significant protection of one customer from another customer's losses.</p><p class="depth0">Customer Funds. The Act requires the strict segregation of customer funds from those of the person holding such funds. One of the primary purposes of this requirement is to prevent the misapplication of those funds for purposes other than those intended by the customer, which may affect not only the customer but the market as a whole. The purpose of segregation is also to identify customer deposits as assets of the customer, rather than the firm, in order that in bankruptcy such funds are payable only to satisfy the carrying firm's obligations to such customers and not other obligations of the firm. In assessing comparability of protection of customer funds, the Commission will consider protections accorded customer funds in a bankruptcy under applicable law, as well as protection from fraud.</p><p class="depth0">Recordkeeping and Reporting. Recordkeeping requirements have long been recognized as the linchpin of the Commission's regulatory scheme. Reporting and recordkeeping requirements assist in determining that a registrant is acting in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder. Similarly, reporting requirements ensure that customers are timely advised of the transactions that have been executed on their behalf, thus ensuring that they are aware of their positions in the markets and may object to any transactions that they believe are in error. The Commission will consider the types of records maintained, the ability through those records to trace funds and transactions, and the period of retention and accessibility of records under the information sharing arrangements discussed below in considering comparability.</p><p class="depth0">Sales Practice Standards. In 1982, Congress reaffirmed the importance of minimum sales practice standards to protect customers from fraud or misrepresentation by requiring any futures association registered by the Commission to adopt and enforce rules governing the sales practices of its members. The Commission has consistently provided that written disclosure of the risks of futures and options trading is essential to ensure that potential customers are aware of these risks and are not otherwise misled and that other appropriate disclosure is made. The Commission will review the type and manner of disclosure given and the mechanisms for assuring the disclosure requirements are met and, in particular, the treatment of discretionary accounts for which, for example, Commission

rule 166.2 requires particularized documentation of intent to confer discretion in the case of foreign futures and options transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance. Finally, in assessing comparability of a program, the Commission will examine the procedures employed by the governmental authority or the appropriate self-regulatory organization to audit for compliance with, and to take action as appropriate against those persons that violate, the requirements of that program.</p><p class="depth0">Information Sharing. As noted above, any exemption of a general nature would also require an information sharing arrangement between the Commission and the appropriate governmental or self-regulatory organization to ensure Commission access to information on an as needed basis as may be necessary to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. The information subject to these arrangements generally would be of a type necessary in the first instance to monitor domestic markets and to protect domestic customers trading on foreign markets.</p><p class="depth0">Firm-specific information that is potentially relevant to protection of domestic customers engaged in foreign transactions could include the following: (1) Registration qualification status; (2) names of principals; (3) current capital; (4) location of customer funds; (5) address of main office and branches; (6) exchange and self-regulatory organization memberships; (7) the existence of any derogatory information such as that required to be disclosed on the Commission's Form 7-R; (8) notice of limitations imposed on activities; (9) notice of undersegregation or undercapitalization; (10) notice of misuse of customer funds; and (11) notice of sanctions or of expulsion from exchange or self-regulatory organization membership. The Commission believes that much of the above information would be public in the ordinary course in most jurisdictions. From time to time, the Commission also may need immediate access to financial information concerning risks posed to domestic firms by the carrying of foreign positions.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to information that relates to the financial stability and creditworthiness of the firm, the Commission should have access to transaction-specific information that confirms the execution of orders and prices and facilitates tracing of customer funds. Such data could include records reflecting: (1) That an order has been received by a firm on behalf of one or more United States customers; (2) that an order has been executed on an exchange on behalf of one or more United States customers; (3) that funds to margin, guarantee or secure United States customer transactions have been received by a firm and deposited in an appropriate depository; and (4) the price at which a transaction was executed and general access to pricing information.</p><p class="depth0">Again, such information is likely to be maintained in the ordinary course of business. Tracing of customer funds would be most essential in cases of insolvency where repatriation of funds is at issue.</p><p class="depth0">The Commission may also seek relevant position data information, including the identity of the position holder and related positions, in connection with surveillance of a potential ``market disruption.'' This is particularly true in the case of integrated markets.</p><p class="depth0">The Commission wishes to emphasize that the information sharing arrangements discussed herein are not necessarily a substitute for, nor would they preclude, a more formal agreement or arrangement with respect to the sharing of information.</p><p class="depth0">Marketing Activities by Firms Granted Rule 30.10 Relief</p><p class="depth0">FR date and citation: November 3, 1992, 57 FR 49644; August 17, 1994, 59 FR 42158.

Sec. Appendix B to Part 30--Interpretative Statement With Respect to the</p><p class="depth0">Secured Amount Requirement Set Forth in Sec. 30.7</p><p class="depth0">1. Rule 30.7 requires FCMs who accept money, securities or property from foreign futures and foreign options customers to maintain in a separate account or accounts such money, securities and property in an amount at least sufficient to cover or satisfy all of its current obligations to those customers. \1\ This amount is denominated as the ``foreign futures or foreign options secured amount'' and that term is defined in Rule 1.3(rr). The separate accounts must be maintained under an account name that clearly

identifies the funds as belonging to foreign futures and foreign options customers at a depository that meets the requirements of Rule 30.7(c). Further, each FCM must obtain and retain in its files for the period provided in Rule 1.31 an acknowledgment from the depository that the depository was informed that such money, securities or property are held for or on behalf of foreign futures and foreign options customers and are being held in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ``Foreign futures or foreign options customer'' means ``any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions who trades in foreign futures or foreign options: Provided, That an owner or holder of a proprietary account as defined in paragraph (y) of [Rule 1.3] shall not be deemed to be a foreign futures or foreign options customer within the meaning of [Rules 30.6 and 30.7].'' Rule 30.1(c). ``Foreign futures'' means ``any contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery made, or to be made, on or subject to the rules of any foreign board of trade.'' Rule 30.1(a). ``Foreign option'' means ``any transaction or agreement which is or is held out to be of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an `option,' `privilege,' `indemnity,' `bid,' `offer,' `put,' `call,' `advance guaranty,' or `decline guaranty,' made or to be made on or subject to the rules of any foreign board of trade.'' Rule 30.1(b).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. In a series of orders issued pursuant to Rule 30.10, the Commission required that certain foreign firms exempt from registration as FCMs essentially comply with the standards of Rule 30.7. \2\ Specifically, the Commission stated that ``[the secured amount] requirement is intended to ensure that funds provided by U.S. customers for foreign futures and options transactions, whether held at a U.S. FCM under Rule 30.7(c) or a firm exempted from registration as an FCM under CFTC Rule 30.10, will receive equivalent protection at all intermediaries and exchange clearing organizations.'' \3\ The Commission further interpreted Rule 30.7 to require each FCM and Rule 30.10 firm to take appropriate action (i.e., set aside funds in a ``mirror'' account) in the event that it becomes aware of facts leading it to conclude that foreign futures and foreign options customer funds are not being handled consistent with the requirements of Commission rules or relevant order for relief by any subsequent intermediary or exchange clearing organization.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Under Rule 30.10, the Commission may exempt a foreign firm acting in the capacity of an FCM from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'') and compliance with certain Commission rules based upon the firm's compliance with comparable regulatory requirements imposed by the firm's home-country regulator or self-regulatory organization (``SRO''). Once the Commission determines that the foreign jurisdiction's regulatory structure offers comparable regulatory oversight, the Commission may issue an Order granting general relief subject to certain conditions. Firms seeking confirmation of relief (referred to herein as ``Rule 30.10 firms'') must make certain representations set forth in the Rule 30.10 order issued to the regulator or SRO from the firm's home country. For a list of those foreign regulators and SROs that have been issued a Rule 30.10 order, see appendix C to part 30. In certain cases, where a foreign regulator or SRO has requested that firms subject to its jurisdiction be granted broader relief to engage in transactions on exchanges other than in its home jurisdiction (referred to herein as ``expanded relief''), the relief has been granted where the relevant authority has represented that it will monitor its firms for compliance with the terms of the order in connection with such offshore transactions. Although Rule 30.10 orders generally exempt foreign intermediaries from compliance with the secured amount requirement under Rule 30.7, firms seeking confirmation of the expanded relief must represent that, with respect to transactions entered into on behalf of U.S. customers on any non-U.S. exchange located outside their home country, they will treat U.S. customer funds in a manner consistent with the provisions of Rule 30.7. For the most recent order granting expanded relief, see 64 FR 50248 (September 16, 1999) (Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited).</p><p class="depth0">\3\ 64 FR 50248, 50251, n.19 (emphasis added).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Upon further analysis and reconsideration of this matter, the Commission has determined to revise its prior interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement. The Commission notes that the initial depository's ability to identify customer funds affords foreign futures and foreign options customers a measure of protection in the event that the intermediating FMC or foreign firm becomes insolvent. Moreover, Rule 30.6(a) requires that foreign futures and foreign options customers receive a Rule 1.55 written disclosure explaining that the treatment of customer funds outside the U.S. may not afford the same level of protection offered in the U.S. These protections exist whetehr the intermediating firm is a U.S. FCM or a firm exempt from such registration under Rule 30.10. \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Although orders for expanded relief exempt foreign firms from compliance with Rule 1.55, sales practice standards and the treatment of customer funds constitute two of the specific elements examined in evaluating whether the particular foreign regulatory program provides a basis for permitting substituted compliance for purposes of exemptive relief pursuant to Rule 30.10. appendix A to part 30.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">4. The Commission further notes, however, that, in February 1998, Rule 30.6 was amended to permit an FCM to open a commodity account for a foreign futures or foreign options customer without providing the Rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement or obtaining an acknowledgment of receipt of such statement, provided that the customer is, at the time at which the account is opened, one of several types of sophisticated customers enumerated in Rule 1.55(f) (``Rule 1.55(f) customers''). \5\ While the amendment to Rule 30.6(a) extinguished the obligation to provide a standardized risk disclosure statement to

Rule 1.55(f) customers at the time of the account opening, the Commission stated that FCMs have obligations to these customers independent of such a duty that would be material in the circumstances of a given transactions. \6\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ 63 FR 8566 (February 20, 1998). The list of sophisticated customers referenced in Rule 1.55(f) closely tracks, with one exception, the list of ``eligible swap participants'' in Rule 35.1.</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Id. at 8569.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">5. After careful consideration of the issue, the Commission has determined that intermediaries should advise all customers (regardless of their level of sophistication) to consider making appropriate inquiries relating to the treatment of customer funds by depositories located outside the jurisdiction of the intermediating firm. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that an FCM, at a minimum, must provide each foreign futures or foreign option customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either: (1) Rule 1.55(b)(7), \7\ or (2) Paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c). \8\ Rule 30.10 firms must provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c), or a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by the firm's home country regulator. The Commission further encourages all firms, whether domestic or foreign, to provide a Rule 1.55 written risk disclosure to all customers, regardless of each customer's respective level of experience. The Commission notes that, in any instance where a firm provides a Rule 1.55(f) customer with a written disclosure, it is not necessary for the firm to obtain an acknowledgment of receipt. In addition, those FCMs that already have provided customers with a disclosure tracking either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c) (or in the case of Rule 30.10 firm, a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by its home country regulatory) need not provide those same customers with an additional written disclosure.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ Rule 1.55(b)(7) reads as follows: Foreign futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a foreign exchange. This is the case even if the foreign exchange is formally ``linked'' to a domestic exchange whereby a trade executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange. No domestic organization regulates the activities of a foreign exchange, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions on such exchange, and no domestic regulator has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs. For these reasons, customers who trade on foreign exchanges may not be afforded certain of the protections which apply to domestic transactions, including the right to use alternative dispute resolution. In particular, funds received from customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular transaction.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ Appendix A to Rule 1.55(c) is the Generic Risk Disclosure Statement, which FCMs may use as an alternative to the Risk Disclosure Statement prescribed in Rule 1.55(b). The Commission understands that most FCMs, in particular those that are most active in international markets, use the Generic Risk Disclosure Statement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c) read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">6. Deposited cash and property.</p><p class="depth0">You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or property you deposit for domestic and foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover your money or property may be governed by specified legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which has been specifically identifiable as your own will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution in the event of a shortfall.</p><p class="depth0">8. Transactions in other jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth0">Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of the regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6. For the reasons set forth above, the Commission is revising its interpretation of the secured amount requirement set forth in Rule 30.7. The Commission believes that the Rule 30.7 acknowledgment required of FCMs, or other appropriate acknowledgment required by Rule 30.10 firms, only applies to the maintenance of the account or accounts containing foreign futures and foreign options customer funds by the initial depository, and not to the manner in which any subsequent depository holds or subsequently transmits those funds. If an FCM receives

from the initial depository the acknowledgment described in Rule 30,7, furnishes to each foreign futures or foreign options customer a written disclosure statement tracking the language set forth in Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A of Rule 1.55(c) and otherwise complies with the provisions of Rule 30.7, then it may include all funds maintained in the separate account or accounts in calculating its secured amount requirement. A Rule 30.10 firm must satisfy the same requirements, except that it may provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by is home regulator.</p><p class="depth0">7. IF an FCM or Rule 30.10 firm fails to receive the required acknowledgment from the initial depository or provide the above written disclosure statement (and in certain circumstances, receive from customers and acknowledgment of receipt), then it must set aside funds with an acceptable depository and receive from such depository the required acknowledgment.</p><p class="depth0">8. The Commission's interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement will apply to all regulated activities with all new and existing foreign futures and foreign options customers as of October 11, 2000. The Commission's interpretation does not alter any other requirement set forth in Rule 30.7 or any other section of part 30.

In that regard, the Commission examines, among other things, whether the cash price series is reliable, acceptable, publicly available and timely; that the cash settlement price is reflective of the underlying cash market; and that the cash settlement price is not readily susceptible to manipulation. In making its determination, the Commission considers the design and maintenance of the index, the method of index calculation, the nature of the component security prices used to calculate the index, the breadth and frequency of index dissemination, and any other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In considering the susceptibility of an index to manipulation, the Commission examines several factors, including the structure of the primary and secondary markets for the component equities, the liquidity of the component stocks, the method of index calculation, the total capitalization of stocks underlying the index, the number, weighting and capitalization of individual stocks in the index, and the existence of surveillance sharing agreements between the board of trade and the securities exchange(s) on which the underlying securities are traded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To verify that the index is not narrow-based, the Commission considers the number and weighting of the component securities and the aggregate value of average daily trading volume of the lowest weighted quartile of securities. Under the Act, a security index is narrow-based if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The index is composed of fewer than 10 securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any single security comprises more than 30% of the total index weight;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The five largest securities comprise more than 60% of the total index weight; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The lowest-weighted securities that together account for 25% of the total weight of the index have an aggregate dollar value of average daily trading volume of less than US$30 million (or US$50 million if the index includes fewer than 15 securities).
