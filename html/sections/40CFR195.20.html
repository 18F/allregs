Fees will be assessed based on the current information  in EPA's proficiency data bases. Participants who intend to pay the  invoiced fee amount must send their payment to EPA following the  procedures in the invoice. Organizations or individuals who wish to  notify EPA of any errors or corrections they wish to make to their  listing status must do so by following the instructions on the payment  invoice. Corrected payment invoices for both the RMP Program and the RCP  Program shall be sent to: Radon Proficiency Programs User Fees, c/o  Sanford Cohen and Associates, Inc. (SC&A;), 1418 I-85 Parkway,  Montgomery, Alabama, 36106. EPA will review the corrections noted on the  payment invoice, adjust the payment invoice amount (as appropriate) and  issue a new invoice. Participants must pay the amount in the corrected  payment invoice within 30 days of the date listed on the corrected  invoice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the appropriate fee or a revised payment invoice for an  individual or organization participating in the RMP or RCP program has  not been received by EPA on or before the payment due date, EPA will  send, by certified mail, notice that the individual or organization will  be delisted from the proficiency program unless he/she pays the fee  within 30 days of this second certified notification. If payment still  has not been received by EPA after 30 days of the second certified  notification, the organization's or individual's listing shall be  removed from the proficiency program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> New or initial applicants to the RMP or RCP programs will be  assessed a fee at the time of their initial application. EPA will send a  payment invoice to the new applicant upon acceptance of the initial  application. The applicant will be given at least 30 days from the date  on the payment invoice to remit payment. The fee assessed will be  prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of the application. If  the appropriate fee has not been received by EPA by the payment due  date, the application will be placed in an inactive file with no further  action taken by EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment Procedures. Each remittance to EPA under this section  shall be in United States currency and shall be paid by certified check,  personal or business check, or money order made payable to the order of  the ``U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'' and sent to: U.S. EPA,  Washington Financial Management Center, Radon Proficiency Program User  Fees (IRAA), P.O. Box 952491, St. Louis, Missouri, 63195-2491. The fee  payment shall include the original copy of the EPA payment invoice.  Collection of fees will begin in the calendar year beginning January 1,  1995. Specific guidance on how and when fees must be paid can be found  in How to Pay Your Radon Proficiency Programs User Fees, U.S. EPA/Office  of Radiation and Indoor Air. Copies of this document can be obtained by  contacting the RIS at (334) 272-2797 or by FAX at (334) 260-9051.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Adjustment of Fees. (1) EPA shall collect 100 percent of its  operating costs associated with its radon proficiency programs by  calendar year 1998. As necessary, EPA shall adjust the fees established  by this subpart each year over the next four years to collect the  following percentages of program costs:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 1         Year 2         Year 3         Year 4        Year 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">30%          47.5%            65%          82.5%           100% ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Actual fees for each fiscal year will be calculated based on program  costs and participation rates. New fee schedules will be published in  the Federal Register as a technical amendment final rule to this part to  become effective 30 days or more after publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EPA will use a three-step process to adjust the fees annually.  First, EPA   will estimate the costs of providing each of the proficiency programs  for the upcoming year. EPA will account for future additional fixed  costs (e.g., updating examinations) and increases/decreases in variable  costs due to inflation and other factors. In order to calculate  increases/decreases in costs due to inflation, EPA may use one of the  three following indices: the Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale,  the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and/or a component of the CPI, such as  services. Second, EPA will estimate the number of participants for each  program. At a minimum, these participation rates will be based on past  and current program participation rates. Third, EPA shall calculate the  per capita costs that individuals and organizations should pay to enable  it to recover its fixed and variable costs each year for each program.  EPA shall also consider potential industry impacts as it adjusts to  levels to ultimately achieve full cost recovery over the period of five  years.  [60 FR 41816, Aug. 14, 1995]</p>
