Amounts withheld from a community rated plan's premium disbursement will be deposited into the plan's Contingency Reserve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any subsidization penalty levied against a community rated plan as outlined in 48 CFR 1615.402(c)(3)(ii)(B) must be paid within 60 days from notification. If payment is not received within the 60 day period, OPM will withhold from the community rated carriers the periodic premium payment payable until fully recovered.

Payments to carriers that have been granted a waiver may be made by an alternative payment methodology, subject to OPM approval.
