                                Sec. 160.156-13  Approval inspections and tests for prototype rescue
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After the Commandant notifies the manufacturer that the  prototype rescue boat is in compliance with the requirements of Sec.  160.156-11 of this subpart, the manufacturer may proceed with the  prototype approval inspections and tests required under this section.  The prototype rescue boat, the construction of which was witnessed under  Sec. 160.135-11 of this part, must be used for the tests in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the Coast  Guard must conduct the approval inspections and witness the approval  tests required under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturer requirements. To proceed with approval inspections  and tests required by this section, the manufacturer must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the Commandant and cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection (OCMI) of where the approval inspections and tests required  under this section will take place, and such notification must be in  sufficient time to allow making travel arrangements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arrange a testing schedule that allows for a Coast Guard  inspector to travel to the site where the testing is to be performed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Admit the Coast Guard inspector to any place where work or  testing is performed on rescue boats or their component parts and  materials for the purpose of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conducting inspections as necessary to determine that the  prototype is constructed by the methods and with the materials specified  in the plans reviewed under Sec. 160.156-9, and the inspection report  under Sec. 160.156-11, of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assuring that the quality assurance program of the manufacturer  is satisfactory;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Witnessing tests; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Taking samples of parts or materials for additional inspections  or tests; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make available to the Coast Guard inspector the affidavits or  invoices from the suppliers of all essential materials used in the  production of rescue boats, together with records identifying the lot or  serial numbers of the rescue boats in which such materials were used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prototype rescue boat readiness. All tests must be  conducted on a completely outfitted rescue boat, including fixed  equipment such as a compass, searchlight, and navigating lights. Loose  equipment may be substituted by weights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FRP prototype rescue boat lay-up. For the prototype of each  design of an FRP rescue boat, the lay-up must be made of unpigmented  resins and clear gel coat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel tank. Each non-portable fuel tank must be tested by a  static head above the tank top of 3 m (10 ft) of water without showing  any leaks or signs of permanent distortion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> IMO Revised recommendation on testing. Each prototype rescue  boat of each design must pass each of the tests for the applicable hull  type described in the IMO Revised recommendation on testing, part 1,  section 7 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.156-5 of this  subpart). Tests must be conducted in accordance with these paragraphs of  IMO Revised recommendation on testing, Part 1, with the following  modifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fire retardancy/release mechanism and engine tests (Paragraphs  1/6.2, 6.9, 6.10, 6.14). The tests in the following IMO Revised  recommendation on testing paragraphs may be accomplished independent of  the rescue boat, and may be considered completed and need not be  repeated if the tests have been previously shown to meet the following  necessary requirements--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Paragraphs 6.9.3 through 6.9.6;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Paragraphs 6.10.2 through 6.10.6; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Paragraphs 6.14.6 through 6.14.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Impact test (Paragraph 1/6.4). The rigid vertical surface must  not be displaced or deformed as a result of the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Flooded stability test for rigid rescue boats only (Paragraph  1/6.8). Any materials used to raise the test weights representing the  rescue boat occupants above the seat pan must be at least as dense as  fresh water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Rescue boat operational test, operation of engine (Paragraph 1/ 7.1.5). For the 4-hour rescue boat maneuvering period, the rescue boat  must not (except for a short period to measure towing force and to  demonstrate towing fixture durability) be secured, and must be run  through its full range of speeds and full range of all controls  throughout the period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Survival recovery test (Paragraph 1/6.10.8). The recovery  demonstration must show that no more than two crewmembers are required  to recover a helpless person of ninety-fifth percentile by weight  described in ASTM F 1166 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.156-5  of this subpart) while the crewmembers and helpless person are each  wearing a lifejacket.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Rescue boat seating space test (Paragraph 1/7.1.3). The average  mass of persons used to test the rescue boat seating space must be  determined by weighing as a group or individually. Each person must wear  an inherently buoyant SOLAS lifejacket with at least 150 N of buoyancy  or a Coast Guard-approved lifejacket approved under approval series  160.155. The operator(s) must demonstrate that the rescue boat can be  operated while wearing a Coast Guard approved, insulated-buoyant  immersion suit approved under approval series 160.171. The Commandant  will give consideration to requests to test at, and designate rescue  boats for, a heavier occupant weight than that stated in the IMO LSA  Code, chapter V (incorporated by reference, Sec. 160.156-5 of this  subpart).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Visual inspection. Each rescue boat must be visually inspected  to confirm--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance with this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conformance with the plans reviewed under Sec. 160.156-9 of  this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ease of operation and maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test waiver. The Commandant may waive certain tests for a rescue  boat identical in construction to smaller and larger rescue boats that  have successfully completed the tests. Tests associated with rescue boat  components that have already been approved by the Commandant are not  required to be repeated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> At the request of the manufacturer and discretion of the  Commandant, an independent laboratory may perform approval inspections  and witness approval tests required by this section so long as the  inspections and tests are performed and witnessed in accordance with the  procedures agreed upon between the independent laboratory and Commandant  under 46 CFR part 159, subpart 159.010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After completion of approval inspections and tests required by  this section, the manufacturer must comply with the requirements of 46  CFR 159.005-9(a)(5) by preparing and submitting to the Commandant for  review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prototype approval test report containing the same  information   recommended by IMO MSC Circ. 980 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  160.156-5 of this subpart). The report must include a signed statement  by the Coast Guard inspector (or independent laboratory as permitted by  paragraph (f) of this section) who witnessed the testing, indicating  that the report accurately describes the testing and its results; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The final plans of the rescue boat as built. The plans must  include, in triplicate--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The instructions for training and maintenance described in  Sec. Sec. 160.156-19 and 160.156-21 of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The final version of the plans required under Sec. 160.156-9  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Commandant will review the report and plans submitted under  paragraph (g) of this section, and, if satisfactory to the Commandant,  will approve the plans under 46 CFR 159.005-13.</p>
