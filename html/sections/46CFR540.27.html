Whereas ______ (Name of Applicant) (Hereinafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') is the Owner or Charterer of the passenger Vessel(s) specified in the annexed Schedule (``the Vessels''), which are or may become engaged in voyages to or from U.S. ports, and the Applicant desires to establish its financial responsibility in accordance with section 2 of Public Law 89-777, 89th Congress, approved November 6, 1966 (``the Act'') then, provided that the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'') shall have accepted, as sufficient for that purpose, the Applicant's application, supported by this Guaranty, and provided that FMC shall issue to the Applicant a Certificate (Casualty) (``Certificate''), the undersigned Guarantor hereby guarantees to discharge the applicant's legal liability in respect of claims for damages for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages of the Vessels to or from U.S. ports, in the event that such legal liability has not been discharged by the Applicant within 21 days after any such passenger or other person, or, in the event of death, his or her personal representative, has obtained a final judgment (after appeal, if any) against the Applicant from a U.S. Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction, or has become entitled to payment of a specified sum by virtue of a compromise settlement agreement made with the Applicant, with the approval of the Guarantor, whereby, upon payment of the agreed sum, the Applicant is to be fully, irrevocably and unconditionally discharged from all further liability to such passenger or other person, or to such personal representative, with respect to such claim.</p><p class="depth0">2.
