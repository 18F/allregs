The requirements of this section do  not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been embedded or  incorporated into a polymer matrix that itself has been reacted (cured);  embedded in a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to  undergo further processing, except mechanical processing; or imported  into an article as defined at 40 CFR 720.3(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>,  (a)(6)(ii), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). When  determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as  required for Sec. 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g.,  enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local  ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace  policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent  exposure, where feasible.
