                                Sec. 314.510  Approval based on a surrogate endpoint or on an effect
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis  of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the  drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably  likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other  evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a  clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.   Approval under this section will be subject to the requirement that the  applicant study the drug further, to verify and describe its clinical  benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate  endpoint to clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical benefit to  ultimate outcome. Postmarketing studies would usually be studies already  underway. When required to be conducted, such studies must also be  adequate and well-controlled. The applicant shall carry out any such  studies with due diligence.</p>
