                                Sec. 63.1588  What inspections must I conduct?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If your treatment units are required to have covers, you must conduct the following inspections:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must visually check the cover and its closure devices for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the supporting wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must perform an initial visual inspection with follow-up inspections at least once per year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that you find a defect on a treatment unit in use, you must repair the defect within 45 days. If you cannot repair within 45 days, you must notify the EPA or the designated State authority immediately and report the reason for the delay and the date you expect to complete the repair. If you find a defect on a treatment unit that is not in service, you must repair the defect prior to putting the treatment unit back in wastewater service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you own or operate a control device used to meet the requirements

for Sec. 63.1586, you must comply with the inspection and monitoring requirements of Sec. 63.695(c) of subpart DD of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To comply with the performance standard specified in Sec. 63.1586(b), you must develop an inspection and monitoring plan. This inspection and monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A method to determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, the influent HAP mass loading, i.e., the annual mass quantity for each HAP entering the wastewater treatment plant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A method to determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, your POTW's annual HAP emissions for all units up to and including the secondary influent pumping station or up to and not including the secondary treatment units as of October 26, 1999. The method you use to determine your HAP emissions, such as modeling or direct source measurement, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be approved by your EPA Regional Office, State, or local regulatory agency for use at your POTW;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Account for all factors affecting emissions from your plant including, but not limited to, emissions from wastewater treatment units; emissions resulting from inspection, maintenance, and repair activities; fluctuations (e.g., daily, monthly, annual, seasonal) in your influent wastewater HAP concentrations; annual industrial loading; performance of control devices; or any other factors that could affect your annual HAP emissions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include documentation that the values and sources of all data, operating conditions, assumptions, etc., used in your method result in an accurate estimation of annual emissions from your plant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that your POTW meets the fraction emitted standard of 0.014 or less, i.e., the sum of all HAP emissions from paragraph (c)(2) of this section divided by the sum of all HAP mass loadings from paragraph (c)(1) of this section results in a fraction emitted of 0.014 or less as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A method to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that your POTW is in continuous compliance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1586(b). Continuous compliance means that your emissions, when averaged over the course of a year, do not exceed the level of emissions that allows your POTW to comply with Sec. 63.1586(b). For example, you may identify a parameter(s) that you can monitor that assures your emissions, when averaged over the entire year, will meet the requirements in Sec. 63.1586(b). Some example parameters that may be considered for monitoring include your wastewater influent HAP concentration and flow, industrial loading from your permitted industrial dischargers, and your control device performance criteria. Where emission reductions are due to proper operation of equipment, work practices, or other operational procedures, your demonstration must specify the frequency of inspections and the number of days to completion of repairs. You must, at a minimum, perform the following each month to demonstrate that your annual rolling average of the fraction emitted is 0.014 or less:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the average daily flow of the wastewater entering your POTW treatment plant for the month;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the flow-weighted monthly concentration of each HAP in your influent listed in Table 1 to subpart DD of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Using the current month's information in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, determine a total annual loading (Mg/year) of each HAP entering your POTW treatment plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sum up the values in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section and determine a total annual loading value (Mg/year) for all HAP entering your POTW treatment plant for the current month;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Based on the current month's information in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section along with source testing and emission modeling, for each HAP, determine annual emissions (Mg/year) from all wastewater units up to, but not including, secondary treatment units;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Sum up the values in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section and determine the total annual emissions value for

the month for all HAP from all wastewater units up to, but not including, secondary treatment units;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Calculate the fraction emitted value for the month by dividing the total annual HAP emissions value from paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section by the total annual loading from paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Average the fraction emitted value for the month determined in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, with the values determined for the previous 11 months, to calculate an annual rolling average of the fraction HAP emitted.</p>
