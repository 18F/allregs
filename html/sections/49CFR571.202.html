If the seat cushion adjusts  independently of the seat back, position the seat cushion such that the  highest H-point position is achieved with respect to the seat back, as  measured by SAE Standard J826 JUL95 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 571.5) manikin, with leg length specified in S10.4.2.1 of Sec.  571.208 of this Part. If the specified position of the H-point can be  achieved with a range of seat cushion inclination angles, adjust the  seat inclination such that the most forward part of the seat cushion is  at its lowest position with respect to the most rearward part. All tests  specified by this standard are conducted with the ambient temperature  between 18 degrees C. and 28 degrees C.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Except as specified in S5.2.3 and S5.3 of this section, if the  seat back is adjustable, it is set at an initial inclination position  closest to the manufacturer's design seat back angle, as measured by SAE  Standard J826 JUL95 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5)   manikin. If there is more than one inclination position closest to the  design angle, set the seat back inclination to the position closest to  and rearward of the design angle.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1.1 Procedure for determining presence of head restraints in rear  outboard seats.
