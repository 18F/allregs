                            <p class="depth0">Sections 779.201 through 779.235 discuss the various criteria for determining what business unit or units constitute an ``enterprise'' within the meaning of the Act. Sections 779.237 through 779.245 discuss the criteria for determining what constitutes a ``covered enterprise'' under the Act with respect to the conditions for coverage of those enterprises in which retail sale of goods or services are made. As explained in Sec. Sec. 779.2 through 779.4, previously covered employment in retail and service enterprises will be subject to different monetary standards than newly covered employment in such enterprises until February 1, 1971. For this reason the enterprise coverage provisions of both the prior and the amended Act are discussed in the following sections of this subpart.</p>
