                            <p class="depth0">The following terms are defined in Sec. 4001.2 of this chapter:  Code, EIN, ERISA, fair market value, IRS, multiemployer plan, PBGC,  plan, plan year, and PN.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, for purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial valuation means a valuation of assets and liabilities  performed by an enrolled actuary using the actuarial assumptions used  for purposes of determining the charges and credits to the funding  standard account under section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0">Certified change of collective bargaining representative means a  change of collective bargaining representative certified under the  Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, or the Railway Labor  Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Fair market value of assets has the same meaning as the term has for  minimum funding purposes under section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of  the Code.</p><p class="depth0">Merger means the combining of two or more plans into a single plan.  For example, a consolidation of two plans into a new plan is a merger.</p><p class="depth0">Significantly affected plan means a plan that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Transfers assets that equal or exceed 15 percent of its assets  before the transfer,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Receives a transfer of unfunded accrued benefits that equal or  exceed 15 percent of its assets before the transfer,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Is created by a spinoff from another plan, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Engages in a merger or transfer (other than a de minimis merger  or transfer) either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> After such plan has terminated by mass withdrawal under section  4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> With another plan that has so terminated.</p><p class="depth3">Transfer and transfer of assets or liabilities mean a diminution of  assets or liabilities with respect to one plan and the acquisition of  these assets or the assumption of these liabilities by another plan or  plans (including a plan that did not exist prior to the transfer).  However, the shifting of assets or liabilities pursuant to a written  reciprocity agreement between two multiemployer plans in which one plan  assumes liabilities of another plan is not a transfer of assets or  liabilities. In addition, the shifting of assets between several funding  media used for a single   plan (such as between trusts, between annuity contracts, or between  trusts and annuity contracts) is not a transfer of assets or  liabilities.</p><p class="depth3">Unfunded accrued benefits means the excess of the present value of a  plan's accrued benefits over the fair market value of its assets,  determined on the basis of the actuarial valuation required under  Sec. 4231.5(b).</p>
