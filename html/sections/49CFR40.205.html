                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a collector, you have the responsibility of trying to successfully complete a collection procedure for each employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, during or shortly after the collection process, you become aware of any event that prevents the completion of a valid test or collection (e.g., a procedural or paperwork error), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if doing so is practicable. You may conduct another collection as part of this effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If another collection is necessary, you must begin the new collection procedure as soon as possible, using a new CCF and a new collection kit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, as a collector, laboratory, MRO, employer, or other person implementing these drug testing regulations, you become aware of a problem that can be corrected (see Sec. 40.203), but which has not already been corrected under paragraph (a) of this section, you must take all practicable action to correct the problem so that the test is not cancelled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the problem resulted from the omission of required information, you must, as the person responsible for providing that information, supply in writing the missing information and a statement that it is true and accurate. For example, suppose you are a collector, and you forgot to make a notation on the ``Remarks'' line of the CCF that the employee did not sign the certification. You would, when the problem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the employee failed or refused to sign the certification and that your statement is true and accurate. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the problem is the use of a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form, you must provide a signed statement (i.e., a memorandum for the record). It must state that the incorrect form contains all the information needed for a valid DOT drug test, and that the incorrect form was used inadvertently or as the only means of conducting a test, in circumstances beyond your control. The statement must also list the steps you have taken to prevent future use of non-Federal forms or expired Federal forms for DOT tests. For this flaw to be corrected, the test of the specimen must have occurred at a HHS-certified laboratory where it was tested consistent with the requirements of this part. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must maintain the written documentation of a correction with the CCF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must mark the CCF in such a way (e.g., stamp noting correction) as to make it obvious on the face of the CCF that you corrected the flaw.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the correction does not take place, as the MRO you must cancel the test.
