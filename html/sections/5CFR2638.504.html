                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the Director has reason to believe that an employee is violating or has violated an ethics provision, the Director may initiate proceedings under this section for the purpose of making a finding as to whether there is or has been such a violation. In the context of such proceedings, the Office of Government Ethics has the burden of proof to establish that the employee is violating or has violated an ethics provision. The procedures contained in this section do not apply to findings or orders for action made to obtain compliance with the financial disclosure requirements in title II of the Ethics Act. For those findings and orders, the procedures contained in section 206 of the Act shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigation. The Director may initiate such investigation as is necessary to determine whether proceedings under this section are warranted. Ordinarily, a determination to proceed will be based upon an agency report of investigation filed under Sec. 2638.503(c) and a determination by the Director under Sec. 2638.503(d)(5) that the agency has taken or recommended inappropriate corrective or disciplinary action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. The employee shall be served personally or by United States mail with written notice of commencement of proceedings under this section.

The respondent employee has the right to comment on the alleged violation of an ethics provision by submission of evidence or arguments. As determined by the Director, the submission may be made orally or in writing. In the absence of an extension granted by the Director for good cause shown, comments shall be submitted within the time set forth in the notice</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Finding. The Director will make a written finding as to whether a violation of any ethics provision has occured or is occurring.
