                            <p class="depth0">If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary, is to take over the business of a manufacturer of tobacco products, as a continuing operation, such fiduciary shall, before commencing operations, make application for permit and file bond as required by subpart E, of this part, furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the order of the court, or other pertinent documents, showing his appointment and qualification as such fiduciary, and make a commencing inventory, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 40.201: Provided, That where a diagram has been furnished by the predecessor, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 40.69, the successor may adopt such diagram if it is currently complete and accurate. However, where a fiduciary intends only to liquidate the business, qualification as a manufacturer of tobacco products will not be required if he promptly files with the appropriate TTB officer a written statement to that effect, in duplicate, together with an extension of coverage of the predecessor's bond, executed by the fiduciary and the surety on such bond, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 40.137.
