                            <p class="depth0">Applicants for patent to a placer claim, who are also in possession  of a known vein or lode included therein, must state in their  application that the placer includes such vein or lode. The published  and posted notices must also include such statement. If veins or lodes  lying within placer locations are owned by other parties, the fact  should be distinctly stated in the application for patent and in all the  notices. But in all cases whether the lode is claimed or excluded, it  must be surveyed and marked upon the plat, the field notes and plat  giving the area of the lode claim or claims and the area of the placer  separately. An application which omits to claim such known vein or lode  must be construed as a conclusive declaration that the applicant has no  right of possession to the vein or lode. Where there is no known lode or  vein, the fact must appear by the statement of two or more witnesses.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 3864_Millsite Patents</p><p class="depth0">Source: 35 FR 9758, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.</p>
