                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section shall prevail and be given precedence over any requirements of this subpart which are contrary to this section. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to be contrary to the requirements of Sec. 635.409(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No Federal-aid highway construction project is to be authorized for advertisement or otherwise authorized to proceed unless at least one of the following requirements is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project either: (i) Includes no permanently incorporated steel or iron

materials, or (ii) if steel or iron materials are to be used, all manufacturing processes, including application of a coating, for these materials must occur in the United States. Coating includes all processes which protect or enhance the value of the material to which the coating is applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State has standard contract provisions that require the use of domestic materials and products, including steel and iron materials, to the same or greater extent as the provisions set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State elects to include alternate bid provisions for foreign and domestic steel and iron materials which comply with the following requirements. Any procedure for obtaining alternate bids based on furnishing foreign steel and iron materials which is acceptable to the Division Administrator may be used. The contract provisions must (i) require all bidders to submit a bid based on furnishing domestic steel and iron materials, and (ii) clearly state that the contract will be awarded to the bidder who submits the lowest total bid based on furnishing domestic steel and iron materials unless such total bid exceeds the lowest total bid based on furnishing foreign steel and iron materials by more than 25 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When steel and iron materials are used in a project, the requirements of this section do not prevent a minimal use of foreign steel and iron materials, if the cost of such materials used does not exceed one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent) of the total contract cost or $2,500, whichever is greater. For purposes of this paragraph, the cost is that shown to be the value of the steel and iron products as they are delivered to the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> A State may request a waiver of the provisions of this section if;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State may request a waiver of the provisions of this section if;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application of those provisions would be inconsistent with the public interest; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Steel and iron materials/products are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities which are of a satisfactory quality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for waiver, accompanied by supporting information, must be submitted in writing to the Regional Federal Highway Administrator (RFHWA) through the FHWA Division Administrator. A request must be submitted sufficiently in advance of the need for the waiver in order to allow time for proper review and action on the request. The RFHWA will have approval authority on the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for waivers may be made for specific projects, or for certain materials or products in specific geographic areas, or for combinations of both, depending on the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The denial of the request by the RFHWA may be appealed by the State to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator), whose action on the request shall be considered administratively final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A request for a waiver which involves nationwide public interest or availability issues or more than one FHWA region may be submitted by the RFHWA to the Administrator for action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A request for waiver and an appeal from a denial of a request must include facts and justification to support the granting of the waiver. The FHWA response to a request or appeal will be in writing and made available to the public upon request. Any request for a nationwide waiver and FHWA's action on such a request may be published in the Federal Register for public comment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In determining whether the waivers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be granted, the FHWA will consider all appropriate factors including, but not limited to, cost, administrative burden, and delay that would be imposed if the provision were not waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard State and Federal-aid contract procedures may be used to assure compliance with the requirements of this section.
