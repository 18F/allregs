Such BMP's must reduce the amount of pollutants that  enter a stream or lake by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods, such as reducing the application rates or changing the  application methods of potential pollutants, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Methods, such as practices or combinations of practices which  prevent potential pollutants from leaving source areas or reduce the  amount of potential pollutants that reach a stream or lake after leaving  a source area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participant's water quality plans shall as a minimum include  BMP's for all critical areas or sources. The plans will include BMP's  which are required but not cost-shared. Non-cost-shared BMP's, essential  for the performance and maintenance of cost-shared BMP's shall be  required as a condition of the RCWP contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The participant is responsible for compliance with all other  applicable Federal, State, and local laws that deal with the  participant's nonpoint source water quality problems, such as the  treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. BMP's required for  compliance may be cost shared.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is recognized that the participants' water-quality plans upon  which   the RCWP contracts are to be based may include conservation measures  other than those related to water quality improvement. These measures  are not eligible for cost sharing under this program. The installation  of such conservation measures will not be required as a condition of the  RCWP contract and will not be shown in the time schedules for  implementing BMP's.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time schedules for implementing BMP's are to be provided in the  participant's water quality plan. The time schedule is to establish the  length of the contract within the 5 to 10 year period established by  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Natural Resources Conservation Service will certify as to  the technical adequacy of the water-quality plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The soil conservation districts are to review and approve all  water-quality plans and modifications.</p>
