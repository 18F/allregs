                            <p class="depth0">All qualifying applications under this subpart will be scored based  on the criteria contained in Sec. 1703.126. Awards will be made by RUS  based on the highest ranking applications and the amount of financial  assistance available for grants. All applicants will be notified in  writing of the score each application receives, and included in this   notification will be a tentative minimum required score to receive  financial assistance. If the score received by the applicant could  result in the denial of its application, or if its score, while  apparently sufficient to qualify for financial assistance, may be  surpassed by the score awarded to a competing application after appeal,  that applicant may appeal its numerical scoring. Any appeal must be  based on inaccurate scoring of the application by RUS and no new  information or data that was not included in the original application  will be considered. The appeal must be made, in writing, within 10 days  after the applicant is notified of the scoring results. Appeals shall be  submitted to the Administrator, RUS, U.S. Department of Agriculture,  1400 Independence Ave., SW., STOP 1590, Washington, DC 20250-1590.  Thereafter, the Administrator will review the original scoring to  determine whether to sustain, reverse, or modify the original scoring  determination. Final determinations will be made after consideration of  all appeals. The Administrator's determination will be final. A copy of  the Administrator's decision will be furnished promptly to the  applicant.
