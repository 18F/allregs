Such emission sources are not subject to any other notification, recordkeeping, or reporting sections in this subpart, including Sec. 63.2350(c), except as indicated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each storage tank subject to this subpart having a capacity of less than 18.9 cubic meters (5,000 gallons) and for each transfer rack subject to this subpart that only unloads organic liquids (i.e., no organic liquids are loaded at any of the transfer racks), you must keep documentation that verifies that each storage tank and transfer rack identified in paragraph (a) of this section is not required to be controlled. The documentation must be kept up-to-date (i.e., all such emission sources at a facility are identified in the documentation regardless of when the documentation was last compiled) and must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review according to Sec. 63.10(b)(1), including records stored in electronic form in a separate location. The documentation may consist of identification of the tanks and transfer racks identified in paragraph (a) of this section on a plant site plan or process and instrumentation diagram (P&ID;).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each storage tank subject to this subpart having a capacity of 18.9 cubic meters (5,000 gallons) or more that is not subject to control based on the criteria specified in Table 2 to this subpart, items 1 through 6, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> You must submit the information in Sec. 63.2386(c)(1), (2), (3), and (10)(i) in either the Notification of Compliance Status, according to the schedule specified in Table 12 to this subpart, or in your first Compliance report, according to the schedule specified in Sec. 63.2386(b), whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must submit the information in Sec. 63.2386(c)(1), (2), (3), and (10)(i) in either the Notification of Compliance Status, according to the schedule specified in Table 12 to this subpart, or in your first Compliance report, according to the schedule specified in Sec. 63.2386(b), whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> If you submit your first Compliance report before your Notification of Compliance Status, the Notification of Compliance Status must contain the information specified in Sec. 63.2386(d)(3) and (4) if any of the changes identified in paragraph (d) of this section have occurred since the filing of the first Compliance report.
