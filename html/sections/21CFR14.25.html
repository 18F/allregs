A committee discusses any matter pending before it in an open portion of its meeting unless the meeting has been closed for that matter under Sec. 14.27. To the maximum extent feasible, consistent with the policy expressed in Sec. 14.27, a committee conducts its discussion of pending matters in an open portion. No public participation is permissible during this portion of the meeting except with the consent of the committee Chairperson.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The closed presentation of data. Information prohibited from public disclosure under part 20 and the regulations referenced therein is presented to the committee in a closed portion of its meeting. However, if information is in the form of a summary that is not prohibited from public disclosure, the presentation is to be made in an open portion of a meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The closed committee deliberations. Deliberations about matters before an advisory committee may be held in a closed portion of a meeting only upon an appropriate determination by the Commissioner under Sec. 14.27.</p>
