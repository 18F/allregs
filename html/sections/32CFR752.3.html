                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Settlement authority. 10 U.S.C. 7622 provides settlement  authority for damage caused by a vessel in the naval service or by other  property under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy;  compensation for towage or salvage service, including contract salvage,  rendered to a vessel in the naval service or to other property of the  Navy; or damage caused by a maritime tort committed by any agent or  employee of the Department of the Navy or by property under the  jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy. The limit on the Secretary's  settlement authority is payment of $15,000,000. A claim   which is settled for an amount over $15,000,000 is certified to Congress  for payment. Section 7622 provides that the Secretary may delegate his  settlement authority in matters where the amount to be paid is not over  $1,000,000. Under the Secretary's delegation, settlements not exceeding  $500,000 may be effected by the Judge Advocate General. Under the  Secretary's delegation, settlements not exceeding $250,000 may be  effected by the Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General (Admiralty and  Maritime Law).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlement is final. The legislation specifically authorizes the  Secretary to settle, compromise, and pay claims. The settlement, upon  acceptance of payment by the claimant, is final and conclusive for all  purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Settlement procedures. Where the amount paid is over $500,000,  after agreement is reached with counsel or claimants, the procedure is  to prepare a settlement recommendation for the approval of the Secretary  of the Navy. When settlement has been approved, the voucher required for  effecting payment is prepared. The settlement check is then exchanged,  in keeping with the commercial practice, for an executed release. In  some situations, where the exchange of documents is impracticable, a  claimant is requested to forward the executed release by mail, on the  understanding that the release does not become effective until the check  is received in payment. Claims settled under 10 U.S.C. 7622 are paid out  of annual Department of Defense appropriations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation period. The Secretary's settlement authorization is  subject to a two-year limitation. This limitation is not extended by the  filing of claim nor by negotiations or correspondence. A settlement  agreement must be reached before the end of the two-year period. If  settlement is not accomplished, then the claimant must file suit under  the appropriate statute to avoid the limitation bar. The agreement  reached in negotiations must receive the approval of the Secretary of  the Navy or his designee, depending on the amount involved, prior to the  expiration of the two-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Matters in litigation. When suit is filed, the matter comes  within the cognizance of the Department of Justice, and the Secretary of  the Navy is no longer able to entertain a claim or to make  administrative settlement.
