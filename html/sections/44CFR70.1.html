                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this part is to provide an administrative procedure  whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator will review the scientific  or technical submissions of an owner or lessee of property who believes  his property has been inadvertently included in designated A, AO, A1-30,  AE, AH, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE, and  V Zones, as a result of the transposition of the curvilinear line to  either street or to other readily identifiable features. The necessity  for this part is due in part to the technical difficulty of accurately  delineating the curvilinear line on either an FHBM or FIRM. These  procedures shall not apply when there has been any alteration of  topography since the effective date of the first NFIP map (i.e., FHBM or  FIRM) showing the property within an area of special flood hazard.  Appeals in such circumstances are subject to the provisions of part 65  of this subchapter.  [62 FR 55718, Oct. 27, 1997]</p>
