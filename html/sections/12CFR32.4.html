For purposes of determining compliance with 12 U.S.C. 84, and 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as applicable, and this part, a national bank or savings association shall determine its lending limit as of the most recent of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The last day of the preceding calendar quarter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date on which there is a change in the bank's or savings association's capital category for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.3 or 12 CFR 324.402, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. (1) A national bank's or savings association's lending limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be effective as of the earlier of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the bank's or savings association's Call Report is submitted; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the bank's or savings association's Call Report is required to be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A national bank's or savings association's lending limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be effective on the date that the limit is to be calculated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> More frequent calculations. If the appropriate Federal banking agency determines for safety and soundness reasons that a national bank or savings association should calculate its lending limit more frequently than required by paragraph (a) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide written notice to the national bank or savings association directing it to calculate its lending limit at a more frequent interval, and the national bank or savings association shall thereafter calculate its lending limit at that interval until further notice.
