doses of 1 milliliter or less (or equivalent in weight) of the product, and having the property, following the injection of non-fatal doses into an animal, of causing to be produced therein another

product containing the soluble substance in serum or other body fluid of an immunized animal which specifically neutralizes the toxin against which the animal is immune.</p><p

including use when intended through administration or application to a person as an aid in diagnosis, or in evaluating the degree of susceptibility or immunity possessed by a person, and including also any other use for purposes of diagnosis if the diagnostic substance so used is prepared from or with the aid of a biological product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Proper name, as applied to a product, means the name designated in the license for use upon each package of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Dating period means the period beyond which the product cannot be
