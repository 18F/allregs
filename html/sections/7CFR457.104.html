In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, the number of pounds determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by any applicable yield conversion factor for non-irrigated skip-row planting patterns, and multiplying the result by the coverage level percentage you elect.</p><p class="depth0">Skip-row. A planting pattern that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consists of alternating rows of cotton and fallow land or land planted to another crop the previous fall; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualifies as a skip-row planting pattern as defined by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) or a successor agency.</p><p class="depth0">2.

If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mature white cotton may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such production to count will be reduced if the price quotation for cotton of like quality (price quotation ``A'') for the applicable growth area is less than 85 percent of price quotation ``B.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Price B is defined as the Upland Cotton National Average Loan Rate determined by FSA, or as specified in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Price A is defined as the loan value per pound for the bale determined in accordance with the FSA Schedule of Premiums and Discounts for the applicable crop year, or as specified in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to count will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation ``A'' by 85 percent of price quotation ``B.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Colored cotton lint will not be eligible for quality adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">11. Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting patterns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Your prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.
