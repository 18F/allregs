The STD must prepare a project  agreement in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart C. The agreement  shall be based on an acceptable estimate for the cost of acquisition. On  projects where the initial project agreement was executed after June 9,  1998, a State may request credit toward the non-Federal share, for early  acquisitions, donations, or other contributions applied to the project  provided conditions in 23 U.S.C. 323 and 23 CFR 710.501, are satisfied.</p>
