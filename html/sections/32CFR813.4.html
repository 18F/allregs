If an air component is assigned, the air component normally manages documentation of its operations. Air Force COMCAM and visual information

support for joint operations will be proportionate to USAF combat force participation. In airlift operations, HQ AMC may be the supported command.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During contingencies, exercises, and other operations, the Air Force provides its share of Unified Command headquarters COMCAM and visual information support forces for still photographic, motion media, graphics, and other VI services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> COMCAM and VI forces take part in Air Force and joint exercises to test procedures and over-all readiness. COMCAM and VI forces also provide VI products to command, operations, public affairs, historical, and other significant customers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sourcing COMCAM forces. See AFMAN 10-401 for specific procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When VI support teams are required, the lead wing's VI UTC deploys as primary, whenever possible. If lead wing VI support is not available, the providing command sources the requirement from other active or reserve component forces, or coordinates with other MAJCOMs for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Air Force VI personnel who assist supported commands in determining COMCAM and VI requirements and sourcing consider the total USAF VI community as a resource. Planners consider employing USAF deployable VI support teams, augmentation combat documentation teams from AFSPACECOM, AETC, and ACC, as well as active and reserve COMCAM teams.</p>
