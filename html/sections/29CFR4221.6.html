                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time and place of hearing established. Unless the parties agree to proceed without a hearing as provided in Sec. 4221.5(c), the parties and the arbitrator shall, no later than 15 days after the written acceptance by the arbitrator is mailed to the parties, establish a date and place for the hearing. If agreement is not reached within the 15-day period, the arbitrator shall, within 10 additional days, choose a location and set a hearing date. The date set for the hearing may be no later than 50 days after the mailing date of the arbitrator's written acceptance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. After the time and place for the hearing have been established, the arbitrator shall serve a written notice of the hearing on the parties by hand, by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that includes verification or acknowledgment of receipt and meets (if applicable) the requirements of Sec. 4000.14 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appearances. The parties may appear in person or by counsel or other representatives. Any party that, after being duly notified and without good cause shown, fails to appear in person or by representative at a hearing or conference, or fails to file documents in a timely manner, is deemed to have waived all rights with respect thereto and is subject to whatever orders or determinations the arbitrator may make.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record and transcript of hearing. Upon the request of either party, the arbitrator shall arrange for a record of the arbitration hearing to be made by stenographic means or by tape recording. The cost of making the record and the costs of transcription and copying are costs of the arbitration proceedings payable as provided in Sec. 4221.10(b) except that, if only one party requests that a transcript of the record be made, that party shall pay the cost of the transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Order of hearing. The arbitrator shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Opening. The arbitrator shall open the hearing and place in the record the notice of initiation of arbitration or the initiation agreement.

All witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation and are subject to cross-examination by opposing parties. If testimony of an expert witness is offered by a party without prior notice to the other party, the arbitrator shall grant the other party a reasonable time to prepare for cross-examination and to produce expert witnesses on its own behalf. The arbitrator may on his or her own initiative call expert witnesses on any issue raised in the arbitration. The cost of any expert called by the arbitrator is a cost of the proceedings payable as provided in Sec. 4221.10(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Continuance of hearing. The arbitrator may, for good cause shown, grant a continuance for a reasonable period. When granting a continuance, the arbitrator shall set a date for resumption of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Filing of briefs. Each party may file a written statement of facts and argument supporting the party's position. The parties' briefs are due no later than 30 days after the close of the hearing. Within 15 days thereafter,
