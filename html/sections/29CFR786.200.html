                            <p class="depth0">The Division has taken the position that the exemption provided by  section 13(b)(17) of the Fair Labor Standards Act will be deemed  applicable even though some nonexempt work (that is, work of a nature  other than that which characterizes the exemption) is performed by the  employee during the workweek, unless the amount of such nonexempt work  is substantial. For enforcement purposes, the amount of nonexempt work  will be considered substantial if it occupies more than 20 percent of  the time worked by the employee during the workweek.
