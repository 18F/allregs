                                Sec. 37.225  What judgment must I make about the benefits of using a TIA?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Before deciding that a TIA is appropriate, you also must judge that  using a TIA could benefit defense research objectives in ways that  likely would not happen if another type of assistance instrument were  used (e.g., a cooperative agreement subject to all of the requirements  of 32 CFR part 34). You, in conjunction with Government program  officials, must consider the questions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of  this section, to help identify the benefits that may justify using a TIA  and reducing some of the usual requirements. In accordance with  Sec. 37.1030, you will report your answers to these questions to help  the DoD measure the Department-wide benefits of using TIAs and meet  requirements to report to the Congress. Note that you must give full  concise answers only to questions that relate to the benefits that you  perceive for using the TIA, rather than another type of funding  instrument, for the particular research project. A simple ``no'' or  ``not applicable'' is a sufficient response for other questions. The  questions are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Will the use of a TIA permit the involvement in the research of  any commercial firms or business units of firms that would not otherwise  participate in the project? If so:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> What are the expected benefits of those firms' or divisions'  participation (e.g., is there a specific technology that could be  better, more readily available, or less expensive)?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Why would they not participate if an instrument other than a TIA  were used? You should identify specific provisions of the TIA or  features of the TIA award process that enable their participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Will the use of a TIA allow the creation of new relationships  among participants at the prime or subtier levels, among business units  of the same firm, or between non-Federal participants and the Federal  Government that will help the DoD get better technology in the future?  If so:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Why do these new relationships have the potential for helping  the DoD get technology in the future that is better, more affordable, or  more readily available?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award  process that enable these relationships to form? If so, you should be  able to identify specifically what they are. If not, you should be able  to explain specifically why you think that the relationships could not  be created if an assistance instrument other than a TIA were used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Will the use of a TIA allow firms or business units of firms  that traditionally accept Government awards to use new business  practices in the execution of the research that will help us get better  technology, help us get new technology more quickly or less expensively,  or facilitate partnering with commercial firms? If so:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> What specific benefits will the DoD potentially get from the use  of these new practices? You should be able to explain specifically why  you foresee a potential for those benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award  process that enable the use of the new practices? If so, you should be  able to identify those provisions or features and explain why you think  that the practices could not be used if the award were made using an  assistance instrument other than a TIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Are there any other benefits of the use of a TIA that could help  the Department of Defense better meet its objectives in carrying out the  research project? If so, you should be able to identify specifically  what they are, how they can help meet defense objectives, what features  of the TIA or award process enable the DoD to realize them, and why the  benefits likely would not be realized if an assistance instrument other  than a TIA were used.</p>
