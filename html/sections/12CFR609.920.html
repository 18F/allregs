E-SIGN requires that statutes and regulations be  interpreted to allow E-commerce as long as the safeguards of E-SIGN are  met and its exceptions recognized. Generally, an electronic record or  signature satisfies any provision of the Act or its implementing  regulations that require such records and signatures to be written,  signed, or in paper form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> System institutions may interpret the Act and its implementing  regulations broadly to allow electronic transmissions, communications,  records, and submissions, as provided by E-SIGN. This means that the  terms address, copy, distribute, document, file, mail, notice, notify,  record, provide, send, signature, sent, written, writing, and similar  words generally should be interpreted to permit electronic  transmissions, communications, records, and submissions in business,  consumer, or commercial transactions.</p>
