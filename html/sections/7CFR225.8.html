                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each State agency shall maintain complete and accurate current  accounting records of its Program operations which will adequately  identify funds authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,  assets, liabilities, income, claims against sponsors and efforts to  recover overpayments, and expenditures for administrative and operating  costs. These records shall be retained for a period of three years after  the date of the submission of the final Program Operations and Financial  Status Report (SF-269), except that, if audit findings have not been  resolved, the affected records shall be retained beyond the three year  period until such time as any issues raised by the audit findings have  been resolved. The State agency shall also retain a complete record of  each review or appeal conducted, as required under Sec. 225.13, for a  period of three years following the date of the final determination on  the review or appeal. Records may be kept in their original form or on  microfilm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each State agency shall submit to FNS a final report on the  Summer Food Service Program Operations   (FNS-418) for each month no more than 90 days following the last day of  the month covered by the report. States shall not receive Program funds  for any month for which the final report is not postmarked and/or  submitted within this time limit unless FNS grants an exception. Upward  adjustments to a State's report shall not be made after 90 days from the  month covered by the report unless authorized by FNS. Downward  adjustments shall always be made without FNS authorization, regardless  of when it is determined that such adjustments need to be made.  Adjustments to a State's report shall be reported to FNS in accordance  with procedures established by FNS. Each State agency shall also submit  to FNS a quarterly Financial Status Report (SF-269) on the use of  Program funds. Such reports shall be submitted no later than 30 days  after the end of each fiscal year quarter. Obligations shall be reported  only for the fiscal year in which they occur. Action may be taken  against the State agency, in accordance with Sec. 225.5(a)(1), for  failure to submit accurate and timely reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State agency must submit to FNS a final Financial Status  Report no later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year, on a  form (SF-269) provided by FNS. Any requested increase in reimbursement  levels for a fiscal year resulting from corrective action taken after  submission of the final Program Operations and Financial Status Reports  shall be submitted to FNS for approval. The request shall be accompanied  by a written explanation of the basis for the adjustment and the actions  taken to minimize the need for such adjustments in the future. If FNS  approves such an increase, it will make payment, subject to availability  of funds. Any reduction in reimbursement for that fiscal year resulting  from corrective action taken after submission of the final fiscal year  Program Operations and Financial Status Reports shall be handled in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 225.12(d), except that amounts  recovered may not be used to make Program payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By May 1 of each year, State agencies must submit to the  appropriate FNSRO a list of potential private nonprofit organization  sponsors. The list must include the following information for each  applicant sponsor:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Geographical area(s) proposed to be served;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proposed number of sites; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any available details of each proposed site including address,  dates of operation, and estimated daily attendance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State agencies must also notify the appropriate FNSRO within 5  working days after they approve each private nonprofit organization to  participate as a SFSP sponsor. When State agencies notify the FNSRO of  sponsor approval, they must provide the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any changes to site locations, dates of operation, and estimated  daily attendance that was previously provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The hours and type(s) of approved meal service at each site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type of site approval--open, restricted open, closed  enrolled, or camp; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other important details about each site that would help the  FNSRO plan reviews, including whether the site is rural or urban, or  vended or self-preparation.
