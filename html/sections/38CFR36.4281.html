                            <p class="depth0">Upon receiving a notice of default the Secretary may at any time  prior to the termination of the borrower's interest in the property  require the holder upon penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty to  transfer and assign the loan and the security therefor to the Secretary  or to another designated by him or her upon receipt of payment of the  balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such  assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the  transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of Sec.  36.4286.
