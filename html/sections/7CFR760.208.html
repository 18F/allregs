                                Sec. 760.208  Availability of funds.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">By law, ``up to'' $50 million per year for the years in question may  be approved for use by the Secretary and accordingly, within that cap,  the only funds that will be considered available to pay claims will be  that amount approved by the Secretary. Nothing in these regulations will  limit the ability of the Secretary to restrict the availability of funds  for the program as permitted by the relevant legislation. Payments will  not be made for claims arising out of a particular year until, for all  claims for that year, the time for applying for a payment has passed. In  the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the  Secretary within the statutory cap, approval of eligible applications  would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will  prorate the available funds by a national factor to reduce the total  expected payments to the amount made available by the Secretary. FSA  will make payments based on the factor for the national rate determined  by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments in such manner as it determines  appropriate and reasonable. Claims that are unpaid or prorated for a  calendar year for any reason will not be carried forward for payment  under other funds for later years or otherwise, but will be considered,  as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.</p>
