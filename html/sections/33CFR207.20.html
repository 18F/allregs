                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limit of Canal. The canal, including approaches, extends from  the Canal Station Minus 100 in Cape Cod Bay, approximately one and six- tenths (1.6) statute miles seaward of the Canal Breakwater Light,  through dredged channels and land cuts to Cleveland Ledge Light in  Buzzards Bay approximately four (4) statute miles southwest of Wings  Neck.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supervision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The movement of ships, boats and craft of every  description through the canal and the operation and maintenance of the  waterway and all property of the United States pertaining thereto shall  be under the supervision of the Division Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer  Division, New England, Corps of Engineers, Waltham, Massachusetts, or  the authorized representative of the division engineer, the Engineer-In- Charge of the Cape Cod Canal. The division engineer or the Engineer-In- Charge from time to time will prescribe rules governing the dimensions  of vessels which may transit the waterway, and other special conditions  and requirements which will govern the movement of vessels using the  waterway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Engineer-In-Charge, through the marine traffic controller on  duty, will enforce these regulations and monitor traffic through the  canal. The marine traffic controller on duty is the individual  responsible for interpretation of these regulations with respect to  vessels transiting the canal. Vessels transiting the canal must obey the  orders of the marine traffic controller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The government has tugs stationed at the West Boat Basin for  emergency use on an on-call basis. A patrol vessel is manned and  operational 24-hours a day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Communications. There is a marine traffic controller on duty 24  hours a day, seven days a week, in the traffic control center located at  the Canal Administrative Office. The primary method of communications  between the canal and vessels transiting will be by   VHF-FM Marine radio. The traffic controller can also be contacted by  telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For radio communications, call the traffic controller on channel  16 to establish contact. The transmissions will then be switched to  channel 12 or 14 as the working channel to pass information. Channel 13  is also available at the canal office; however, the use of channel 13  should be limited to emergency situations or whenever vessels do not  have one of the other channels. All four channels are monitored  continuously by the traffic controller. Radio discipline will be adhered  to in accordance with FCC rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For telephone communications with the traffic controller, call  (617) 759-4431.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vessels shall maintain a radio guard on Marine VHF-FM channel 13  during the entire passage through the canal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All radio communications in the vicinity of the canal are tape  recorded for future reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vessels allowed passage. The canal is open for passage to all  adequately powered vessels properly equipped and seaworthy, of sizes  consistent with safe navigation as governed by the controlling depths  and widths of the channel and the vertical and horizontal clearances of  the bridges over the waterway. The granting of permission for any vessel  to proceed through the waterway shall not relieve the owners, agents and  operators of full responsibility for its safe passage. No vessel having  a greater draft forward than aft will be allowed to transit the canal.  Craft of low power and wind driven are required to have and use  auxiliary power during passage throughout the canal as defined in  paragraph (a) of this section. Low powered vessels will be required to  await slack water or favorable current for canal transit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tows. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tows shall be made-up outside the canal entrances. All  vessels engaged in towing other vessels not equipped with a rudder shall  use two lines or a bridle and one tow line. If the vessel in tow is  equipped with a rudder or a ship shaped bow, one tow line may be used.  All tow lines of hawsers must be hauled as short as practicable for safe  handling of the tows. No towboat will be allowed to enter the waterway  with more than two barges in tow unless prior approval is granted by the  Engineer-In-Charge; requests must be submitted 12 hours in advance of  the passage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum length of pontoon rafts using the canal will be  limited to 600 feet, and the maximum width to 100 feet. Pontoon rafts  exceeding 200 feet in length will be required to have an additional tug  on the stern to insure that the tow is kept in line. The tugs used must  have sufficient power to handle the raft safely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dead ships are required to transit the canal during daylight  hours and must be provided with the number of tugs sufficient to afford  safe passage through the canal. (A dead ship will not be allowed to  enter the canal unless prior approval is granted by the Engineer-In- Charge; requests must be submitted 12 hours in advance of the passage).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Dangerous cargoes. The master or pilot of any vessel or tow  carrying dangerous cargoes must notify the Marine Traffic Controller  prior to entering the canal. Dangerous cargoes are defined as those  items listed in 33 CFR 126.10 when carried in bulk (i.e., quantities  exceeding 110 U.S. gallons in one tank) plus Class A explosives  (commercial or military) as listed in 49 CFR 173.53 (commercial) and 46  CFR 146.29-100 (military), liquified natural gas and liquified petroleum  gas. Transportation of dangerous cargoes through the canal shall be in  strict accordance with existing regulations prescribed by law. In  addition, vessels carrying dangerous cargoes shall comply with the  following requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They must have sufficient horsepower to overcome tidal currents  or they will be required to wait for favorable current conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transits will be during daylight hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No transit will be permitted when visibility conditions are  unstable or less than 2 miles at the approaches and throughout the  entire length of the canal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transits must await a clear canal for passage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Obtaining clearance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vessels under 65 feet in length may  enter the canal without obtaining clearance. All craft are required to  make a complete passage through the canal except excursion craft which  may operate and change direction within the canal in accordance with  procedures coordinated with the marine traffic controller on duty. When  the railroad bridge span is in the closed (down) position, all vessels  are directed not to proceed beyond the points designated by stop signs  posted east and west of the railroad bridge. Vessels proceeding with a  fair tide (with the current) should turn and stem the current at the  designated stop points until the railroad bridge is in the raised (open)  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessels 65 feet in length and over shall not enter the canal  until clearance has been obtained from the marine traffic controller by  radio. See paragraph (c) ``Communications'' for procedures. If a vessel,  granted prior clearance, is delayed or stops at the mooring basins,  state pier, or the Sandwich bulkhead, a second clearance must be  obtained prior to continuing passage through the canal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vessels will be given clearance in the order of arrival, except  when conditions warrant one-way traffic, or for any reason an order of  priority is necessary, clearance will be granted in the following order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First--To vessels owned or operated by the United States,  including contractors' equipment employed on canal maintenance or  improvement work.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second--To passenger vessels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third--To tankers and barges docking and undocking at the  Canal Electric Terminal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fourth--To merchant vessels, towboats, commercial fishing  vessels, pleasure boats and miscellaneous craft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedures in adverse weather: Vessels carrying flammable or  combustible cargoes as defined in 46 CFR 30.25 will be restricted from  passage through the canal when visibility is less than \1/2\ mile. Other  vessels may transit the canal in thick weather by use of radar with the  understanding that the U.S. Government will assume no responsibility:  And provided, That clearance has been obtained from the marine traffic  controller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Traffic lights. There are three sets of traffic lights showing  red, green, and yellow that are operated on a continuous basis at the  canal. The traffic lights apply to all vessels 65 feet in length and  over. The traffic lights are a secondary system that is operated in  support of the radio communications system. The traffic lights are  located at the easterly canal entrance, Sandwich, and at the westerly  entrance to Hog Island Channel at Wings Neck. A third traffic light is  located at the Canal Electric Terminal basin on the south side of the  canal in Sandwich, and applies only to vessels arriving and departing  that terminal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Westbound traffic. When the green light is on at the eastern  (Cape Cod Bay) entrance, vessels may proceed westward through the canal.  When the red light is on, any type of vessel 65 feet in length and over  must stop clear of the Cape Cod Bay entrance channel. When the yellow  light is on, vessels 65 feet in length and over and drawing less than 25  feet may proceed as far as the East Mooring Basin where they must stop.  Prior to continuing passage through the canal, clearance must be  obtained from the marine traffic controller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eastbound traffic. When the green light is on at Wings Neck,  vessels may proceed eastward through the canal. When the red light is  on, vessels 65 feet and over in length and drawing less than 25 feet  must keep southerly of Hog Island Channel Entrance Buoys Nos. 1 and 2  and utilize the general anchorage areas adjacent to the improved  channel. Vessel traffic drawing 25 feet and over are directed not to  enter the canal channel at the Cleveland Ledge Light entrance and shall  lay to or anchor in the vicinity of Buzzards Bay Buoy No. 11 (FLW &  Bell) until clearance is granted by the canal marine traffic controller  or a green traffic light at Wings Neck is displayed. When the yellow  light is on, vessels may proceed through Hog Island Channel as far as  the West Mooring Basin where they must stop. Prior to continuing passage  through the canal, clearance must be obtained from the marine traffic  controller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Railroad Bridge Signals. The following signals at the Buzzards  Bay Railroad Bridge will be given strict attention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The vertical lift span on the railroad bridge is normally kept  in the raised (open) position except when it is lowered for the passage  of trains, or for maintenance purposes. Immediately preceding the  lowering of the span, the operator will sound two long blasts of an air  horn. Immediately preceding the raising of the span, the operator will  sound one long blast of an air horn. When a vessel or craft of any type  is approaching the bridge with the span in the down (closed) position  and the span cannot be raised immediately, the operator of the bridge  will so indicate by sounding danger signals of four short blasts in  quick succession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the lift span is in the down (closed) position in foggy  weather or when visibility is obscured by vapor, there will be four  short blasts sounded from the bridge every two minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Speed. All vessels are directed to pass mooring and boat basin  facilities, the state pier, and all floating plant engaged in  maintenance operations of the waterway at a minimum speed consistent  with safe navigation. In order to coordinate scheduled rail traffic with  the passage of vessels, to minimize erosion of the canal banks and dikes  from excessive wave wash and suction, and for the safety of vessels  using the canal, the following speed regulations must be observed by  vessels of all types, including pleasure craft. The minimum running time  for the land cut between the East Mooring Basin (Station 35) and the  Administration Office in Buzzards Bay (Station 388) is prescribed as  follows:  Head Tide--60 Minutes Fair Tide--30 Minutes Slack Tide--45 Minutes   The minimun running time between the Administration Office (Station 388)  and Hog Island Channel westerly entrance Buoy No. 1 (Station 661) is  prescribed as follows:  Head Tide--46 Minutes Fair Tide--23 Minutes Slack Tide--35 Minutes   The running time at slack water will apply to any vessel which enters  that portion of the canal between stations 35 and 661, within the period  of one-half hour before or after the predicted time of slack water as  given in the National Ocean Survey publication ``Current Tables,  Atlantic Coast, North America.'' The minimum running time during a head  tide or a fair tide shall apply to any vessel which enters that portion  of the canal between Station 35 and 661 at any time other than  designated above for time requirements at slack tide. Vessels of any  kind unable to make a through transit of the land cut portion of the  canal against a head current of 6.0 knots within a maximum time limit of  2 hours 30 minutes shall be required to obtain the assistance of a  helper tug at the vessel owner's expense or await favorable tide  conditions prior to receiving clearance from the marine traffic  controller. In the event vessels within the confines of the canal fail  to perform and are unable to make sufficient headway against the  currents, the marine traffic controller may activate a helper tug in  accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Management of vessels. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vessels within the limits of the  canal shall comply with applicable navigation rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessels within the limits of the canal shall comply with the  applicable requirements for the use of pilots established by the Coast  Guard, including but not limited to those contained in 46 CFR 157.20-40.  Vessels will not be granted clearance to enter the canal until the  marine traffic controller has been notified of the name of the pilot who  will be handling the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The master of a vessel will be responsible for notifying the  marine traffic controller as soon as an emergency situation appears to  be developing. When in the opinion of the marine traffic controller an  emergency exists, he/she can require the master to accept the assistance  of a helper vessel. Whether or not assistance is provided by a  government vessel or by a private firm under contract to the government,  the government reserves the right to seek compensation from the vessel  owners for all costs incurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Right-of-Way: All vessels proceeding with the current shall have  the right-of-way over those proceeding   against the current. All craft up to 65 feet in length shall be operated  so as not to interfere with the navigation of vessels of greater length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Passing of vessels: The passing of one vessel by another when  proceeding in the same direction is prohibited except when a leading low  powered ship is unable to make sufficient headway. However, extreme  caution must be observed to avoid collision, and consideration must be  given to the size of the ship to be overtaken, velocity of current and  wind, and atmospheric conditions. Masters of vessels involved shall  inform the marine traffic controller on duty of developing situations to  facilitate coordination of vessel movement. Meeting or passing of  vessels at the easterly end of the canal between Station Minus 40 and  Station 60 will not be permitted, except in cases of extreme emergency,  in order to allow vessels to utilize the center line range to minimize  the effects of hazardous eddies and currents. Due to bank suction and  tidal set, meeting and passing of vessels at the following locations  will be avoided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sagamore Bridge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bourne Bridge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Railroad Bridge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mass Maritime Academy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Unnecessary delay in canal: Vessels and other type crafts must  not obstruct navigation by unnecessarily idling at low speed when  entering or passing through the canal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Stopping in the waterway: Anchoring in the Cape Cod Canal  Channel is prohibited except in emergencies. For the safety of canal  operations it is mandatory that the masters of all vessels anchoring in  or adjacent to the canal channel (Cape Cod Bay to Cleveland Ledge Light)  for any reason, immediately notify the marine traffic controller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Utilization of mooring and boat basins and the Sandwich  Bulkhead: Vessels mooring or anchoring in the mooring or boat basins at  the Sandwich bulkhead must do so in a manner not to obstruct or impede  vessel movements to and from facilities. These facilities are of limited  capacity and permission to occupy them for periods exceeding 24 hours  must be obtained in advance from the marine traffic controller. Mooring  in the West Boat Basin at Buzzards Bay, near the railroad bridge, is not  permitted except in an emergency. Fishing boats, yachts, cabin cruisers  and other craft utilizing the East Boat Basin on the south side of the  canal at Sandwich, Massachusetts are not permitted to tie up at the  Corps of Engineers landing float or anchor in a manner to prevent canal  floating plant from having ready access to the float. All vessels or  barges left unattended must be securely tied with adequate lines or  cables. The United States assumes no liability for damages which may be  sustained by any craft using the bulkhead at Sandwich or the canal  mooring or boat basin facilities. Vessels shall not be left unattended  along the face of the government bulkhead. A responsible person with  authority to authorize and/or accomplish vessel movement must remain  onboard at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Grounded, wrecked or damaged vessels. In the event a vessel is  grounded, or so damaged by accident as to render it likely to become an  obstruction and/or hazard to navigation in the waterway, the division  engineer or the division engineer's authorized representative shall  supervise and direct all operations that may be necessary to remove the  vessel to a safe locality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Deposit of refuse. No oil or other allied liquids, ashes, or  materials of any kind shall be thrown, pumped or swept into the canal or  its approaches from any vessel or craft using the waterway, nor shall  any refuse be deposited on canal grounds, marine structures, or  facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Trespass to property. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (q)  of this section trespass upon the canal property is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Bridges over the canal. The government owns, operates and  maintains all bridges across the canal which include one railroad bridge  and two highway bridges. The division engineer or his/her authorized  representative may establish rules and regulations governing the use of  these bridges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Recreational use of canal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is the policy of  the Secretary of the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers to  provide the public with   safe and healthful recreational opportunities within all water resource  development projects administered by the Chief of Engineers, including  the canal and government lands part thereof. Any recreational use of the  canal and those lands shall be at the users own risk.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All water resource development projects open for recreational  use shall be available to the public without regard to sex, race, creed,  color or national origin. No lessee, licensee, or concessionaire  providing a service to the public shall discriminate against any person  or persons because of sex, race, creed, color or national origin in the  conduct of operations under the lease, license or concession contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Motor vehicles.
