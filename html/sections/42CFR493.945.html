                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Program content and frequency of challenge. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To be approved  for proficiency testing for gynecologic examinations (Pap smears) in  cytology, a program must provide test sets composed of 10- and 20-glass  slides. Proficiency testing programs may obtain slides for test sets  from cytology laboratories, provided the slides have been retained by  the laboratory for the required period specified in Sec. Sec.  493.1105(a)(7)(i)(A) and 493.1274(f)(2). If slide preparations are still  subject to retention by the laboratory, they may be loaned to a  proficiency testing program if the program provides the laboratory with  documentation of the loan of the slides and ensures that slides loaned  to it are retrievable upon request. Each test set must include at least  one slide representing each of the response categories described in  paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, and test sets should be  comparable so that equitable testing is achieved within and between  proficiency testing providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To be approved for proficiency testing in gynecologic cytology,  a program must provide announced and unannounced on-site testing for  each individual at least once per year and must provide an initial  retesting event for each individual within 45 days after notification of  test failure and subsequent retesting events within 45 days after  completion of remedial action described in Sec. 493.855.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To determine the accuracy of an individual's response on a  particular challenge (slide), the program must compare the individual's  response for each slide preparation with the response that reflects the  predetermined consensus agreement or confirmation on the diagnostic  category, as described in the table in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this  section. For all slide preparations, a 100% consensus agreement among a  minimum of three physicians certified in anatomic pathology is required.  In addition, for premalignant and malignant slide preparations,  confirmation by tissue biopsy is required either by comparison of the  reported biopsy results or reevaluation of biopsy slide material by a  physician certified in anatomic pathology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An individual qualified as a technical supervisor under Sec.  493.1449 (b) or (k) who routinely interprets gynecologic slide  preparations only after they have been examined by a cytotechnologist  can either be tested using a test set that has been screened by a  cytotechnologist in the same laboratory or using a test set that has not  been screened. A technical supervisor who screens and interprets slide  preparations that have not been previously examined must be tested using  a test set that has not been previously screened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each slide set must contain 10 or 20 slides with point values  established for each slide preparation based on the significance of the  relationship of the interpretation of the slide to a clinical condition  and whether the participant in the testing event is a cytotechnologist  qualified under Sec. 493.1469 or Sec. 493.1483 or functioning as a  technical supervisor in cytology qualified under Sec. 493.1449 (b) or  (k) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The scoring system rewards or penalizes the participants in  proportion to the distance of their answers from the correct response or  target diagnosis and the penalty or reward is weighted in proportion to  the severity of the lesion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The four response categories for reporting proficiency testing  results and their descriptions are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Category                            Description ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A.................................

For  example, if the correct response on a slide is ``high grade squamous  intraepithelial lesion'' (category ``D'' on the scoring system chart)  and an examinee calls it ``normal or negative'' (category ``B'' on the  scoring system chart), then the examinee's point value on that slide is  calculated as minus five (-5). Each slide is scored individually in the  same manner. The individual's score for the testing event is determined  by adding the point value achieved for each slide preparation, dividing  by the total points for the testing event and multiplying by 100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Criteria for scoring system for a 10-slide test set.
