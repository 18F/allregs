                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Capital classifications after the effective date of section 1365  of the 1992 Act. The capital classification of an Enterprise for  purposes of subpart B of this part is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequately capitalized. Except as otherwise provided under  paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an Enterprise will be classified as  adequately capitalized if the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds total capital equaling or exceeding the risk-based  capital level; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds core capital equaling or exceeding the minimum  capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Undercapitalized. Except as otherwise provided under paragraph  (a)(5) of this section or Sec. 1777.23(c) or Sec. 1777.23(h), an  Enterprise will be classified as undercapitalized if the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds total capital less than the risk-based capital  level; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds core capital equaling or exceeding the minimum  capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Significantly undercapitalized. Except as otherwise provided  under paragraph (a)(5) of this section or Sec. 1777.23(c) or Sec.  1777.23(h), an Enterprise will be classified as significantly  undercapitalized if the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds core capital less than the minimum capital level;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds core capital equaling or exceeding the critical  capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Critically undercapitalized. An Enterprise will be classified as  critically undercapitalized if, as of the date specified in the notice  of proposed capital classification, the Enterprise holds core capital  less than the critical capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discretionary reclassification--determination to reclassify. If  OFHEO determines in writing that an Enterprise is engaging in action or  inaction (including a failure to respond appropriately to changes in  circumstances or unforeseen events) that could result in a rapid  depletion of core capital, or that the value of property subject to  mortgages held or securitized by the Enterprise has decreased  significantly, or that reclassification is otherwise deemed necessary to  ensure that the Enterprise holds adequate capital and operates safely,  OFHEO may reclassify the Enterprise as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise classified as  adequately capitalized;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Significantly undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise  classified as undercapitalized; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Critically undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise  classified as significantly undercapitalized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of reclassification; successive reclassifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  A reclassification of an Enterprise based on action, inaction, or  conditions under paragraph (a)(5) or (c)(5) of this section shall be  considered in the determination of each subsequent capital  classification of the Enterprise, and shall only cease being considered  in the determination of the Enterprise's capital classification after  OFHEO determines that the action, inaction or condition upon which the  reclassification was based has ceased or been eliminated and remedied to  OFHEO's satisfaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the action, inaction, or condition upon which a  reclassification was based under paragraph (a)(5) or (c)(5) of this  section has not ceased or been eliminated and remedied to OFHEO's  satisfaction within such reasonable time as is determined by OFHEO to be  appropriate, OFHEO may consider such failure to be the basis for  additional reclassification under such paragraph (a)(5) or (c)(5) of  this section into a lower capital classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Capital classifications before the effective date of section  1365 of the 1992 Act. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section,  until September 13, 2002, the capital classification of an Enterprise  for purposes of subpart B of this part is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequately capitalized. Except as otherwise provided in  paragraph (c)(5) of this section, an Enterprise will be classified as  adequately capitalized if the Enterprise, as of the date specified in  the notice of proposed capital classification, holds core capital  equaling or exceeding the minimum capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Undercapitalized. An Enterprise will be classified as  undercapitalized if the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, holds core capital equaling or exceeding the minimum  capital level; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is reclassified as undercapitalized by OFHEO under paragraph  (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Significantly undercapitalized. Except as otherwise provided  under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or Sec. 1777.23(c) or Sec.  1777.23(h), an Enterprise will be classified as significantly  undercapitalized if the Enterprise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, held core capital less than the minimum capital level;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As of the date specified in the notice of proposed capital  classification, held core capital equaling or exceeding the critical  capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Critically undercapitalized. An Enterprise will be classified as  critically undercapitalized if, as of the date specified in the notice  of proposed capital classification, the Enterprise held core   capital less than the critical capital level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discretionary reclassification. If OFHEO determines in writing  that an Enterprise is engaging in action or inaction (including a  failure to respond appropriately to changes in circumstances or  unforeseen events) that could result a rapid depletion of core capital,  or that the value of the property subject to mortgages held or  securitized by the Enterprise has decreased significantly or that  reclassification is deemed necessary to ensure that the Enterprise holds  adequate capital and operates safely, OFHEO may reclassify the  Enterprise as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise classified as  adequately capitalized:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Significantly undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise  classified as undercapitalized; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Critically undercapitalized if the Enterprise is otherwise  classified as significantly undercapitalized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior approvals. In making a determination to reclassify an  Enterprise under paragraph (a)(5) or (c)(5) of this section, OFHEO will  not base its decision to reclassify solely on action or inaction that  previously was given specific approval by the Director of OFHEO in  connection with the Director's approval of the Enterprise's capital  restoration plan under section 1369C of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4622),  or of a written agreement with the Enterprise that is enforceable in  accordance with section 1371 of the 1992 Act.</p>
