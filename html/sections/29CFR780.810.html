                            <p class="depth0">Since an employee must actually be ``engaged in'' ginning of cotton  to come within the exemption, an employee engaged in other tasks, not an  integral part of ``ginning'' operations, will not be exempt. (See, for  rule that only the employees performing the work described in the  exemption are exempt, Wirtz v. Burton Mercantile and Gin Co., Inc., 234  F. Supp. 825, aff'd per curiam 338 F. 2d 414, cert. denied 380 U.S. 965;  Wirtz v. Kelso Gin Co., Inc. (E.D. Ark.) 50 Labor Cases 31, 631, 16 WH  Cases 663; Mitchell v. Stinson, 217 F. 2d 210; Phillips v. Meeker  Cooperative Light and Power Ass'n 63 F. Supp. 743, affirmed 158 F. 2d  698; Jenkins v. Durkin, 208 F. 2d 941; Heaburg v. Independent Oil Mill,  Inc., 46 F. Supp. 751; Abram v. San Joaquin Cotton Oil Co., 46 F. Supp.  969.) The following activities are among those not within the meaning of  the term ``engaged in ginning of cotton'':</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transporting seed cotton from farms or other points to the gin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General maintenance work (as opposed to operating repairs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General office and custodial duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ``Watching'' duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Working in the seed house.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transporting seed, hulls, and ginned bales away from the gin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any activity performed during the ``off-season.''</p><p class="depth2">County Where Cotton Is Grown in Commercial Quantities</p>
