                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for termination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OIG may terminate the agreement  of any provider if the OIG finds that any of the following failings can  be attributed to that provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has knowingly and willfully made, or caused to be made, any  false statement or representation of a material fact for use in an  application or request for payment under Medicare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It has submitted, or caused to be submitted, requests for  Medicare payment of amounts that substantially exceed the costs it  incurred in furnishing the services for which payment is requested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It has furnished services that the OIG has determined to be  substantially in excess of the needs of individuals or of a quality that  fails to meet professionally recognized standards of health care. The  OIG will not terminate a provider agreement under paragraph (a) if CMS  has waived a disallowance with respect to the services in question on  the grounds that the provider and the beneficiary could not reasonably  be expected to know that payment would not be made. (The rules for  determining such lack of knowledge are set forth in Sec. Sec. 405.330  through 405.334 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of termination. The OIG will give the provider notice of  termination at least 15 days before the effective date of termination of  the agreement, and will concurrently give notice of termination to the  public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal by the provider. A provider may appeal a termination of  its agreement by the OIG in accordance with subpart O of part 405 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other applicable rules. The termination of a provider agreement  by the OIG is subject to the additional procedures specified in  Sec. Sec. 1001.105 through 1001.109 of this title for notice and  appeals.
