                                Sec. 30.8  Q-8: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply  (the ``clawback'' provision requirement)?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(B)  of EESA, a TARP recipient must ensure that any bonus payment made to a  SEO or the next twenty most highly compensated employees during the TARP  period is subject to a provision for recovery or ``clawback'' by the  TARP recipient if the bonus payment was based on materially inaccurate  financial statements (which includes, but is not limited to, statements  of earnings, revenues, or gains) or any other materially inaccurate  performance metric criteria. Whether a financial statement or  performance metric criteria is materially inaccurate depends on all the  facts and circumstances. However, for this purpose, a financial  statement or performance metric criteria shall be treated as materially  inaccurate with respect to any employee who knowingly engaged in  providing inaccurate information (including knowingly failing to timely  correct inaccurate information) relating to those financial statements  or performance metrics. Otherwise, with respect to a performance  criteria, whether the inaccurate measurement of the performance or  inaccurate application of the performance to the performance criteria is  material depends on whether the actual performance or accurate  application of the actual performance to the performance criteria is  materially different from the performance required under the performance  criteria or the inaccurate application of the actual performance to the  performance criteria. The TARP recipient must exercise its clawback  rights except to the extent it demonstrates that it is unreasonable to  do so, such as, for example, if the expense of enforcing the rights  would exceed the amount recovered. For the purpose of this section, a  bonus payment is deemed to be made to an individual when the individual  obtains a legally binding right to that payment.</p>
