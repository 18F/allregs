Aircraft ratings listed on a person's foreign pilot license, in addition to any issued after testing under the provisions of this part, may be placed on that person's U.S. pilot certificate for private pilot privileges only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Instrument ratings issued. A person who holds an instrument rating on the foreign pilot license issued by a contracting State to the Convention on International Civil Aviation may be issued an instrument rating on a U.S. pilot certificate provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person's foreign pilot license authorizes instrument privileges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 24 months preceding the month in which the person applies for the instrument rating, the person passes the appropriate knowledge test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The person is able to read, speak, write, and understand the English language. If the applicant is unable to meet one of these requirements due to

A person who receives a U.S. private pilot certificate that has been issued under the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May act as pilot in command of a civil aircraft of the United States in accordance with the pilot privileges authorized by this part and the limitations placed on that U.S. pilot certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is limited to the privileges placed on the certificate by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is subject to the limitations and restrictions on the person's U.S. certificate and foreign pilot license when exercising the privileges of that U.S. pilot certificate in an aircraft of U.S. registry operating within or outside the United States; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Limitation on licenses used as the basis for a U.S. certificate. A person may use only one foreign pilot license as a basis for the issuance of a U.S. pilot certificate. The foreign pilot license and medical certification used as a basis for issuing a U.S. pilot certificate under this section must be written in English or accompanied by an English transcription that has been signed by an official or representative of the foreign aviation authority that issued the foreign pilot license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Limitation placed on a U.S. pilot certificate.
