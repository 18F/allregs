Law 103-354 (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) under the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) to eligible IRP intermediaries and applies to ultimate recipients and other involved parties.

This action is needed to implement the provisions of Section 1323 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198, which provides for the transfer of the loan servicing authority for those loans from the HHS to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> These regulations do not negate contractual arrangements that were previously made by the HHS, Office of Community Services (OCS), or the intermediaries operating relending programs that have already been entered into with ultimate recipients under previous regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The loan program is administered by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National Office. The Director, Business and Industry Division, is the point of contact for servicing activities unless otherwise delegated by the Administrator.
