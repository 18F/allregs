                                Sec. 622.5  Answer.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Answer is required. Unless a different period is specified by  the Board, a party who does not wish to consent to a final order must  file an answer within 20 days after being served with a notice that  commences the proceeding. Any subsequent notice which contains amended  allegations and by its terms requires an answer must similarly be  answered within 20 days after service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements of answer; effect of failure to deny. An answer  filed under this section shall concisely state any defenses and  specifically admit or deny each allegation in the notice. A party who  lacks information or knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the  truth of any particular allegation shall so state and this shall have  the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed to be  admitted. A party who intends in good faith to deny only a part of or to  qualify an allegation shall specify so much of it as is true and shall  deny only the remainder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Admitted allegations. If a party filing an answer under this  section elects not to contest any of the allegations of fact set forth  in the notice, the answer shall consist of a statement admitting all of  the allegations to be true. Such answer constitutes a waiver of hearing  as to the facts alleged in the notice, and together with the notice will  provide a record basis on which the presiding officer shall file with  the Board a recommended decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 557. The  recommended decision shall be served on the party, who may file  exceptions thereto within the time provided in Sec. 622.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of failure to answer. Failure of a party to file an  answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a  waiver of the party's right to appear and contest the allegations in the  notice and authorizes the presiding officer, without further notice to  the party, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice and to file  with the Board a recommended decision containing such findings and  appropriate conclusions. The Board or the presiding officer may, for  good cause shown, permit the filing of a delayed answer after the time  for filing and the answer has expired.</p>
