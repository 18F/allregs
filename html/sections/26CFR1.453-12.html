                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Unrecaptured section 1250 gain, as defined in section 1(h)(7), is reported on the installment method if that method otherwise applies under section 453 or 453A and the corresponding regulations. If gain from an installment sale includes unrecaptured section 1250 gain and adjusted net capital gain (as defined in section 1(h)(4)), the unrecaptured section 1250 gain is taken into account before the adjusted net capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Installment payments from sales before May 7, 1997. The amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain in an installment payment that is properly taken into account after May 6, 1997, from a sale before May 7, 1997, is determined as if, for all payments properly taken into account after the date of sale but before May 7, 1997, unrecaptured section 1250 gain had been taken into account before adjusted net capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Installment payments received after May 6, 1997, and on or before August 23, 1999. If the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain in an installment payment that is properly taken into account after May 6, 1997, and on or before August 23, 1999, is less than the amount that would have been taken into account under this section, the lesser amount is used to determine the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain that remains to be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. In each example, the taxpayer, an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year, does not elect out of the installment method. The installment obligation bears adequate stated interest, and the property sold is real property held in a trade or business that qualifies as both section 1231 property and section 1250 property. In all taxable years, the taxpayer's marginal tax rate on ordinary income is 28 percent. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. General rule. This example illustrates the rule of paragraph (a) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1999, A sells property for $10,000, to be paid in ten equal annual installments beginning on December 1, 1999. A originally purchased the property for $5000, held the property for several years, and took straight-line depreciation deductions in the amount of $3000. In each of the years 1999-2008, A has no other capital or section 1231 gains or losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's adjusted basis at the time of the sale is $2000. Of A's $8000 of section 1231 gain on the sale of the property, $3000 is attributable to prior straight-line depreciation deductions and is unrecaptured section 1250 gain. The gain on each installment payment is $800.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As illustrated in the table in this paragraph (iii) of this Example 1., A takes into account the unrecaptured section 1250 gain first. Therefore, the gain on A's first three payments, received in 1999, 2000, and 2001, is taxed at 25 percent. Of the $800 of gain on the fourth payment, received in 2002, $600 is taxed at 25 percent and the remaining $200 is taxed at 20 percent. The gain on A's remaining six installment payments is taxed at 20 percent. The table is as follows:

Installment payments from sales prior to May 7, 1997. This example illustrates the rule of paragraph (b) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that A sold the property in 1994, received the first of the ten annual installment payments on December 1, 1994, and had no other capital or section 1231 gains or losses in the years 1994-2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 1, of A's $8000 of gain on the sale of the property, $3000 was attributable to prior straight-line depreciation deductions and is unrecaptured section 1250 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As illustrated in the following table, A's first three payments, in 1994, 1995, and 1996, were received before May 7, 1997, and taxed at 28 percent. Under the rule described in paragraph (b) of this section, A determines the allocation of unrecaptured section 1250 gain for each installment payment after May 6, 1997, by taking unrecaptured section 1250 gain into account first, treating the general rule of paragraph (a) of this section as having applied since the time the property was sold, in 1994. Consequently, of the $800 of gain on the fourth payment, received in 1997, $600 is taxed at 25 percent and the remaining $200 is taxed at 20 percent. The gain on A's remaining six installment payments is taxed at 20 percent. The table is as follows:

Effect of section 1231(c) recapture. This example illustrates the rule of paragraph (a) of this section when there are non-recaptured net section 1231 losses, as defined in section 1231(c)(2), from prior years as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 1999 A has non-recaptured net section 1231 losses from the previous four years of $1000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As illustrated in the table in paragraph (iv) of this Example 3, in 1999, all of A's $800 installment gain is recaptured as ordinary income under section 1231(c). Under the rule described in paragraph (a) of this section, for purposes of determining the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account, the $800 recaptured as ordinary income under section 1231(c) is treated as reducing unrecaptured section 1250 gain, rather than adjusted net capital gain. Therefore, A has $2200 of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the year 2000, A's installment gain is taxed at two rates. First, $200 is recaptured as ordinary income under section 1231(c). Second, the remaining $600 of gain on A's year 2000 installment payment is taxed at 25 percent. Because the full $800 of gain reduces unrecaptured section 1250 gain, A has $1400 of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The gain on A's installment payment received in 2001 is taxed at 25 percent. Of the $800 of gain on the fourth payment, received in 2002, $600 is taxed at 25 percent and the remaining $200 is taxed at 20 percent.

This example illustrates the application of paragraph (a) of this section when there is a net section 1231 loss as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that A has section 1231 losses of $1000 in 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1999, A's section 1231 installment gain of $800 does not exceed A's section 1231 losses of $1000. Therefore, A has a net section 1231 loss of $200. As a result, under section 1231(a) all of A's section 1231 gains and losses are treated as ordinary gains and losses. As illustrated in the following table, A's entire $800 of installment gain is ordinary gain. Under the rule described in paragraph (a) of this section, for purposes of determining the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account, A's $800 of ordinary section 1231 installment gain in 1999 is treated as reducing unrecaptured section 1250 gain. Therefore, A has $2200 of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the year 2000, A has $800 of section 1231 installment gain, resulting in a net section 1231 gain of $800. A also has $200 of non-recaptured net section 1231 losses. The $800 gain is taxed at two rates. First, $200 is taxed at ordinary rates under section 1231(c), recapturing the $200 net section 1231 loss sustained in 1999. Second, the remaining $600 of gain on A's year 2000 installment payment is taxed at 25 percent. As in Example 3, the $200 of section 1231(c) gain is treated as reducing unrecaptured section 1250 gain, rather than adjusted net capital gain. Therefore, A has $1400 of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The gain on A's installment payment received in 2001 is taxed at 25 percent, reducing the remaining unrecaptured section 1250 gain to $600. Of the $800 of gain on the fourth payment, received in 2002, $600 is taxed at 25 percent and the remaining $200 is taxed at 20 percent.

Sec. 1.453A-1  Installment method of reporting income by dealerson personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A dealer (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) may elect to return the income from the sale of personal property on the installment method if such sale is a sale on the installment plan (as defined in paragraphs (c)(3) and (d) of this section). Under the installment method of accounting, a taxpayer may return as income from installment sales in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the gross profit realized or to be realized when the property is paid for bears to the total contract price. For this purpose, gross profit means sales less cost of goods sold. See paragraph (d) of this section for additional rules relating to the computation of income under the installment method of accounting. In addition, see Sec. 1.453A-2 for rules treating revolving credit plans as installment plans for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of security. A dealer may adopt (but is not required to do so) one of the following four ways of protecting against loss in case of default by the purchaser:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An agreement that title is to remain in the vendor until performance of the purchaser's part of the transaction is completed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A form of contract in which title is conveyed to the purchaser immediately, but subject to a lien for the unpaid portion of the selling price;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A present transfer of title to the purchaser, who at the same time executes a reconveyance in the form of a chattel mortgage to the vendor; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A conveyance to a trustee pending performance of the contract and subject to its provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions of dealer, sale, and sale on the installment plan. For purposes of the regulations under section 453A--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``dealer'' means a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property on the installment plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``sale'' includes sales and other dispositions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the term ``sale on the installment plan'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sale of personal property by the taxpayer under any plan for the sale of personal property, which plan, by its terms and conditions, contemplates that each sale under the plan will be paid for in two or more payments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A sale of personal property by the taxpayer under any plan for the sale of personal property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Which plan, by its terms and conditions, contemplates that such sale will be paid for in two or more payments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Which sale is in fact paid for in two or more payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Installment plans--(1) Traditional installment plans. A traditional installment plan usually has the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Traditional installment plans. A traditional installment plan usually has the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The execution of a separate installment contract for each sale or disposition of personal property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The retention by the dealer of some type of security interest in such property.
Normally, a sale under a traditional installment plan meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revolving credit plans. Sales under a revolving credit plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.453A-2(c)(1))--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are treated, for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 1986, as sales on the installment plan to the extent provided in Sec. 1.453A-2, which provides for the application of the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to sales under revolving credit plans; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are not treated as sales on the installment plan for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Installment income of dealers in personal property--(1) In general. The income from sales on the installment plan of a dealer may be ascertained by treating as income that proportion of

the total payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installment plan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of which they apply) which the gross profit realized or to be realized on the total sales on the installment plan made during each year bears to the total contract price of all such sales made during that respective year. However, if the dealer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that income from sales on the installment plan is clearly reflected, the income from such sales may be ascertained by treating as income that proportion of the total payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installment plan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of which they apply) which either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The income from sales on the installment plan of a dealer may be ascertained by treating as income that proportion of

the total payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installment plan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of which they apply) which the gross profit realized or to be realized on the total sales on the installment plan made during each year bears to the total contract price of all such sales made during that respective year. However, if the dealer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that income from sales on the installment plan is clearly reflected, the income from such sales may be ascertained by treating as income that proportion of the total payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installment plan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of which they apply) which either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The gross profit realized or to be realized on the total credit sales made during each year bears to the total contract price of all credit sales during that respective year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gross profit realized or to be realized on all sales made during each year bears to the total contract price of all sales made during that respective year.
A dealer who desires to compute income by the installment method shall maintain accounting records in such a manner as to enable an accurate computation to be made by such method in accordance with the provisions of this section, section 446, and Sec. 1.446-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross profit and total contract price. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, in computing the gross profit realized or to be realized on the total sales on the installment plan, there shall be included in the total selling price and, thus, in the total contract price of all such sales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of carrying charges or interest which is determined at the time of each sale and is added to the established cash selling price of such property and is treated as part of the selling price for customer billing purposes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of sales made in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1960, the amount of carrying charges or interest determined with respect to such sales which are added contemporaneously with the sale on the books of account of the seller but are treated as periodic service charges for customer billing purposes.
Any change in the amount of the carrying charges or interest in a year subsequent to the sale will not affect the computation of the gross profit for the year of sale but will be taken into account at the time the carrying charges or interest are adjusted. The application of this paragraph (e)(2) to carrying charges or interest described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X Corporation makes sales on the traditional installment plan. The customer's order specifies that the total price consists of a cash price plus a ``time price differential'' of 1\1/2\ percent per month on the outstanding balance in the customer's account, and the customer is billed in this manner. On its books and for purposes of reporting to stockholders, X Corporation consistently makes the following entries each month when it records its sales. A debit entry is make to accounts receivable (for the total price) and balancing credit entries are made to sales (for the established selling price) and to a reserve account for collection expense (for the amount of the time price differential). In computing the gross profit realized or to be realized on the total sales on the installment plan, the total selling price and, thus, the total contract price for purposes of this paragraph (e) would, with respect to sales made in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1960, include the time price differential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Carrying charges not included in total contract price. In the case of sales by dealers in personal property made during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, the income from which is returned on the installment method, if the carrying charges or interest with respect to such sales is not included in the total contract price, payments received with respect to such sales shall be treated as applying first against such carrying charges or interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Other accounting methods. If the vendor chooses as a matter of consistent practice to return the income from installment sales on an accrual method (,) such a course is permissible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Records.

Sales under a revolving credit plan do not constitute sales on the installment plan merely by reason of the fact that the total debt at the end of a billing-month is paid in installments. The terms and conditions of a revolving credit plan do not contemplate that each sale under the plan will be paid for in two or more payments and thus do not meet the requirements of Sec. 1.453A-1(c)(3)(i). In addition, since under a revolving credit plan payments are not generally applied to liquidate any particular sale, and since the terms and conditions of such plan contemplate that account balances may be paid in full or in installments, it is generally impossible to determine that a particular sale under a revolving credit plan is to be or is in fact paid for in installments so as to meet the requirements of Sec. 1.453A-1 (c)(3)(ii). However, paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section provides rules under which a certain percentage of charges under a revolving credit plan will be treated as sales on the installment plan. For purposes of arriving at this percentage, these rules, in general, treat as sales on the plan those sales under a revolving installment credit plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To the extent provided in this paragraph (c) sales under a revolving credit plan will be treated as sales on the installment plan.

However, in computing the percentage to be applied in determining the percentage of charges under a revolving credit plan which will be treated as sales on the installment plan for such prior taxable year (or years), the rule stated in Sec. 1.453A-1(e)(3) shall not apply. See paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section for rules relating to the application of payments to finance charges for such prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of determining the percentage described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a charge under a revolving credit plan will be treated as a sale on the installment plan only if such charge is a sale (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) and meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sale must be of the type which the terms and conditions of the plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments. If the aggregate of sales charged during a billing-month to an account under a revolving credit plan exceeds the required monthly payment, then all sales during such billing-month shall be considered to be of the type which the terms and conditions of such plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments. The required monthly payment shall be the amount of the payment which the terms and conditions of the revolving credit contract require the customer to make with respect to a billing-month. If the amount of such payment is not fixed at the date the contract is entered into, but is dependent upon the balance of the account, then such amount shall be the amount that the customer is required to pay (but not including any past-due payments) as shown on the statement either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the last billing-month ending within the taxpayer's taxable year or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the billing-month of sale, whichever method the taxpayer adopts for all accounts. A taxpayer shall not change such method of determining the required monthly payment based upon

the balance of the account without obtaining the consent of the district director. In any case where the required monthly payment is not set in accordance with a consistent method used during the entire taxable year, the district director may determine the required monthly payment in accordance with the method used during the major portion of such taxable year if the use of such method is necessary in order to reflect properly the income from sales under a revolving credit plan. The requirements stated in this paragraph (c)(3)(i) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under the terms of a revolving credit plan the required monthly payment to be made by customer A is $20. During the billing-month ending in December, sales aggregating $80 are charged to customer A's account, and during the next billing-month, ending in January, sales aggregating $19.95 and finance charges of $.60 are charged to A's account. Since the aggregate of sales charged to customer A's account during the billing-month ending in December ($80) exceeds the required monthly payment ($20), the terms and conditions of the plan contemplate that the sales charged during such billing-month are of the type which will be paid for in two or more installments. Since the aggregate of sales charged to customer A's account during the billing-month ending in January ($19.95) does not exceed the required monthly payment, the sales making up the aggregate of sales in such billing-month are not of the type which the terms and conditions of the plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The terms of a revolving credit plan require a payment of 20 percent of the balance of the customer's account as of the end of the billing-month for which the statement is rendered. A customer makes purchases aggregating $25 in the customer's next to the last billing-month ending within the taxpayer's taxable year, and the balance at the end of that month is $150. At the end of the customer's last billing-month ending within the taxpayer's taxable year, the balance of the account has decreased to $110. If the taxpayer determines the required monthly payment by reference to the payment required on the statement for the last billing-month ending within the taxable year and applies such method consistently to all accounts, then the sales making up the $25 aggregate of sales are of the type which the terms and conditions of the plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments. Although such aggregate was less than the $30 payment (20%x$150) required on the statement rendered for the billing-month of sales. It was more than the $22 (20%x$110) that the customer was required to pay on the statement rendered for his last billing-month ending within the taxable year, and thus meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(i). If, however, the taxpayer determines the required monthly payment by reference to the payment required on the statement for the billing-month of sale, then the sales making up the aggregate of sales during such billing-month do not meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) because such aggregate was less than the $30 payment required on the statement rendered for such month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sale must be charged to an account on which the first payment after the billing-month of sale indicates that the sale is being paid in installments. The first payment after the billing-month of sale indicates that the sale is being paid in installments if, and only if, such payment is an amount which is less than the balance of the account as of the close of the billing-month of sale. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), such balance shall be reduced by any return or allowance credited to the account after the close of the billing-month of sale and before the close of the billing-month within which the first payment after the billing-month of sale is credited to the account, unless the taxpayer demonstrates that the return or allowance was attributable to a charge made in a month subsequent to the billing-month of sale. The requirements stated in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer's annual accounting period ends on January 31.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

All sales made in the billing-month ending December 20 meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) because the first payment on the account after such billing-month ($30) was less than the balance of the account as of the close of such billing-month ($150); and none of the sales made in the billing-month ending January 20 meets the requirements of

this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) because the balance of the account as of the end of such billing-month was liquidated in one payment. By application of the rules of paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, the balance in the account as of the last billing-month ending in the taxable year ($195) consists of $120 of the $150 of sales made in the billing-month ending December 20 and all of the $75 of sales made in the billing-month ending January 20.

The three $20 payments and the $5 return or allowance made in the billing-months ending in the taxable year are applied under the rules in paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section to liquidate the earliest outstanding charges, first to the $55 aggregate of sales in the billing-month ending October 20 and next to $10 of the aggregate of sales made in the billing-month ending November 20. Thus, the balance of the account as of the close of the billing-month ending January 20, $82.56, is made up as follows:

Therefore, $35 of sales will be treated as sales on the installment plan. The $20 aggregate of sales charged during the billing-month ending December 20 does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section because it is in an amount which does not exceed the required monthly payment ($20). (The finance charge of $0.60 added in the billing-month does not enter into the determination of the aggregate of sales for the month because the term ``sales'' (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section does not include finance charges). The $26 aggregate of sales for the billing-month ending January 20 does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section because the first payment after such billing-month ($72.56) was equal to the balance of the account as of the close of such billing-month ($72.56). For this purpose, the balance of $82.56 is reduced by the $10 return or allowance which was credited after the billing-month of sale and before February 20. Thus, of the $82.56 balance of B's account as of the close of the last billing-month ending within corporation X's taxable year, $35 will be treated as sales on the installment plan for purposes of determining the percentage provided for paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.

Assume the facts in Example 2, except that Customer B's revolving credit ledger account is for the period beginning on September 21, 1964 and ending February 20, 1965. Since payments received are first used to liquidate any outstanding finance charges under the rule in paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, the $20 payment in December liquidated the $0.35 finance charge accrued at the end of the November billing-month and the $20 payment in January liquidated the $0.60 finance charge accrued at the end of the December billing-month. The balance of the three $20 payments ($59.05) and the $5 return or allowance are applied (under the rules in paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section) to liquidate the earliest outstanding sales, first to the $55 aggregate of sales in the billing-month ending October 20 and next to $9.05 of the aggregate of sales made in the billing-month ending November 20. Thus, the balance of the account as of the close of the billing-month ending January 20, $82.56, is made up as follows:

Therefore, $35.95 of sales will be treated as sales on the installment plan. The $20 aggregate of sales charged during the billing-month ending December 20 does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section because it is in an amount which does not exceed the

required monthly payment ($20). The $26 aggregate of sales for the billing-month ending January 20 does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section because the first payment after such billing-month ($72.56) was equal to the balance of the account as of the close of such billing-month ($72.56). For this purpose, the balance of $82.56 is reduced by the $10 return or allowance which was credited after the billing-month of sale and before February 20. Thus, of the $82.56 balance of B's account as of the close of the last billing-month ending within corporation X's taxable year $35.95 will be treated as sales on the installment plan for purposes of determining the percentage provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sales under a revolving credit plan which are nonpersonal property sales (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section) do not constitute sales on the installment plan. Therefore, the charges under a revolving credit plan must be reduced by the nonpersonal property sales, if any, under such plan, before application of the sample percentage as provided for in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The taxpayer may treat as the nonpersonal property sales under the plan for the taxable year an amount which bears the same ratio to the total sales under the revolving credit plan made in the taxable year as the total nonpersonal property sales made in such year bears to the total sales made in such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``sales'' includes sales of services, such as a charge for watch repair, as well as sales of property, but does not include finance or service charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``charges'' includes sales of services and property as well as finance or service charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A billing-month is that period of time for which a periodic statement of charges and credits is rendered to a customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term ``nonpersonal property sales'' means all sales which are not sales of personal property made by the taxpayer.

Likewise, charges for services rendered by the taxpayer are nonpersonal property sales unless such services are incidental to and rendered contemporaneously with the sale of personal property, in which case such charges shall be considered as constituting part of the selling price of such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6)(v), each payment received from a customer under a revolving credit plan before the close of the last billing-month ending in the taxable year shall be applied to liquidate the earliest outstanding charges under such plan, notwithstanding any rule of law or contract provision to the contrary. For purposes of determining which charges remain in the balance of an account at the end of the last billing-month ending in the taxable year, the taxpayer may apply returns and allowances which are credited before the close of the last billing-month ending in the taxable year either (A) to liquidate or reduce the charge for the specific item so returned or for which an allowance is permitted, or (B) to liquidate or reduce the earliest outstanding charges. The method so selected for applying returns and allowances shall be followed on a consistent basis from year to year unless the district director consents to a change. Additionally, finance or service charges which are computed on the basis of the balance of the account at the end of the previous billing-month (usually reduced by payments during the current billing-month) are accrued at the end of the current billing-month and are therefore considered, for purposes of determining the earliest outstanding charges, as charged to the account after any sales made during the current billing month. However, for purposes of determining which charges remain in the balance of an account at the end of the last billing-month ending in a taxable year which began after December 31, 1963, payments received during such year shall be applied first against any finance or service charges which were outstanding at the time such payment was received. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to a computation made for purposes of applying the rule described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The taxpayer shall allocate those sales under a revolving credit plan which are treated as sales on the installment plan to the proper year of sale in order to apply the appropriate

gross profit percentage as provided for in Sec. 1.453A-1(e). This allocation shall be made on the basis of the percentages of charges treated as sales on the installment plan which are attributable to each taxable year as determined in the sample of accounts described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, if the taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that income from sales on the installment plan is clearly reflected, all sales may be considered as being made in the taxable year for purposes of applying the gross profit percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation X is a dealer and has elected to report on the installment method those sales under its revolving credit plan which may be treated as sales on the installment plan. Corporation X's taxable year ends on January 31, and the total balance of all its revolving credit accounts as of January 31, 1964, is $2,000,000. The total sales made in the taxable year are $10,000,000 of which $500,000 are nonpersonal property sales. The gross profit percentage realized or to be realized on all sales made in the taxable year is 40 percent. The amount of the gross profit contained in the year-end balance of $2,000,000 which may be deferred to succeeding years is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order to reduce the charges appearing in the year-end balance of revolving credit accounts receivable by the nonpersonal property sales contained therein, corporation X determines the amount of such nonpersonal property sales under the method permitted in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Corporation X first determines the ratio which total nonpersonal property sales made during the year ($500,000) bears to total sales made during the year ($10,000,000), and then applies the percentage (5 percent) thus obtained to the year-end balance of revolving credit accounts receivable ($2,000,000). The nonpersonal property sales thus determined ($100,000) is subtracted from such year-end balance to obtain the charges under the revolving credit plan appearing in the year-end balance ($1,900,000) to which the sample percentage is to be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with generally accepted sampling techniques, the taxpayer selects a probability sample of all revolving credit accounts having balances for billing-months ending in January 1964. The technique employed results in a random selection of accounts with total balances of $100,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis of these sample accounts discloses that of the $100,000 of balances, $10,000 of balances are in accounts on which no payment was credited after a billing-month of sale and on or before the end of the first billing-month ending in the taxable year beginning February 1, 1964. These balances are, therefore, disregarded and not taken into account in the determination of what percentage of sales in the sample is to be treated as sales on the installment plan. Of the remaining $90,000 of balances, the taxpayer determines, by analyzing the ledger cards in the sample, that $63,000 of balances are composed of sales which meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section and are thus treated as sales on the installment plan. The remaining $27,000 of balances either did not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section or were not sales (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section). The percentage of charges in the sample treated as sales on the installment plan is, therefore, 70 percent ($63,000 / $90,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The charges in the year-end balance which are to be treated as sales on the installment plan, $1,330,000, are computed by multiplying the charges to which the sample percentage is applied ($1,900,000) by the sample percentage (70 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The deferred gross profit attributable to sales under the revolving credit plan for the taxable year, $532,000, is determined by multiplying the amount treated as sales on the installment plan ($1,330,000), by the gross profit percentage (40 percent). (Corporation X will be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director that (A) since the gross profit percentage for all sales does not vary materially from the gross profit percentage for all sales made under the revolving credit plan, (B) since only an insubstantial amount of sales included in year-end account balances was made prior to the taxable year, and (C) since the prior year's gross profit percentage does not vary materially from the gross profit percentage for the taxable year, income from sales on the installment plan will be clearly reflected by applying the current year's gross profit percentage for all sales under the revolving credit plan treated as sales on the installment plan.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, but does not apply for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, sales under a revolving credit plan shall not be treated as sales on the installment plan.

Sec. 1.453A-3  Requirements for adoption of or change to installmentmethod by dealers in personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A dealer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.453A-1(c)(1)) may adopt or change to the installment method for a type or types of sales on the installment plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.453A-1(c)(3) and (d)) in the manner prescribed in this section. This section applies only to dealers and only with respect to their sales on the installment plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of electing installment method reporting--(1) Time for election. An election to adopt or change to the installment method for a type or types of sales must be made on an income tax return for the taxable year of the election, filed on or before the time specified (including extensions thereof) for filing such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time for election. An election to adopt or change to the installment method for a type or types of sales must be made on an income tax return for the taxable year of the election, filed on or before the time specified (including extensions thereof) for filing such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adoption of installment method. A taxpayer who adopts the installment method for the first taxable year in which sales are made on an installment plan of any kind must indicate in the income tax return for that taxable year that the installment method of accounting is being adopted and specify the type or types of sales included within the election. If a taxpayer in the year of the initial election made only one type of sale on the installment plan, but during a subsequent taxable year makes another type of sale on the installment plan and adopts the installment method for that other type of sale, the taxpayer must indicate in the income tax return for the subsequent year that an election is being made to adopt the installment method of accounting for the additional type of sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Change to installment method. A taxpayer who changes to the installment method for a particular type or types of sales on the installment plan in acordance with this section must, for each type of sale on the installment plan for which the installment method is to be used, attach a separate statement to the income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which the change is made. Each statement must show the method of accounting used in computing taxable income before the change and the type of sale on the installment plan for which the installment method is being elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deemed elections. A dealer (including a person who is a dealer as a result of the recharacterization of transactions as sales) is deemed to have elected the installment method if the dealer treats a sale on the installment plan as a transaction other than a sale and fails to report the full amount of gain in the year of the sale. For example, if a transaction treated by a dealer as a lease is recharacterized by the Internal Revenue Service as a sale on the installment plan, the dealer will be deemed to have elected the installment method assuming the dealer failed to report the full amount of gain in the year of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Consent. A dealer may adopt or change to the installment method for sales on the installment plan without the consent of the Commissioner. However, a dealer may not change from the installment method to the accrual method of accounting or to any other method of accounting without the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cut-off method for amounts previously accrued. An election to change to the installment method for a type of sale applies only with respect to sales made on or after the first day of the taxable year of change. Thus, payments received in the taxable year of the change, or in subsequent years, in respect of an installment obligation which arose in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of change are not taken into account on the installment method, but rather must be accounted for under the taxpayer's method of accounting in use in the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section applies to sales by dealers in taxable years ending after October 19, 1980, but generally does not apply to sales made after December 31, 1987. For sales made after December 31, 1987, sales by a dealer in personal or real property shall not be treated as sales on the installment plan. (However, see section 453(l)(2) for certain exceptions to this rule.) For rules relating to sales by dealers in taxable years ending before October 20, 1980, see 26 CFR 1.453-7 and 1.453-8 (rev. as of April 1, 1987).
