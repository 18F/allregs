                                Sec.  250.522  How do I manage the thermal effects caused by initial production
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A newly completed or recompleted well often has thermal casing  pressure during initial startup. Bleeding casing pressure during the  startup process is considered a normal and necessary operation to manage  thermal casing pressure; therefore, you do not need to evaluate these  operations as a casing diagnostic test. After 30 days of continuous  production, the initial production startup operation is complete and you  must perform casing diagnostic testing as required in Sec. Sec.  250.520  and 250.522.
