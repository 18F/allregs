No tank shall have been subjected previously to  internal pressure greater than 90 percent of the marked test pressure.  Each tank shall be tested to a pressure at least equal to the marked  test pressure of the tank. Pressure shall be maintained for 30 seconds,  and sufficiently longer to insure complete expansion of tank. Pressure  gauge shall permit reading to accuracy of one percent. Expansion gauge  shall permit reading of total expansion to accuracy of one percent.  Expansion shall be recorded in cubic cm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No leaks shall appear and permanent volumetric expansion shall  not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test  pressure.</p>
