                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Watershed control program. Systems receive 0.5-log  Cryptosporidium treatment credit for implementing a watershed control  program that meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems that intend to apply for the watershed control program  credit must notify the State of this intent no   later than two years prior to the treatment compliance date applicable  to the system in Sec.  141.713.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of an ``area of influence'' outside of which the  likelihood of Cryptosporidium or fecal contamination affecting the  treatment plant intake is not significant. This is the area to be  evaluated in future watershed surveys under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of both potential and actual sources of  Cryptosporidium contamination and an assessment of the relative impact  of these sources on the system's source water quality.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An analysis of the effectiveness and feasibility of control  measures that could reduce Cryptosporidium loading from sources of  contamination to the system's source water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement of goals and specific actions the system will  undertake to reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels. The plan must  explain how the actions are expected to contribute to specific goals,  identify watershed partners and their roles, identify resource  requirements and commitments, and include a schedule for plan  implementation with deadlines for completing specific actions identified  in the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Systems with existing watershed control programs (i.e., programs  in place on January 5, 2006) are eligible to seek this credit. Their  watershed control plans must meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section and must specify ongoing and future actions that will  reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State does not respond to a system regarding approval of  a watershed control plan submitted under this section and the system  meets the other requirements of this section, the watershed control  program will be considered approved and 0.5 log Cryptosporidium  treatment credit will be awarded unless and until the State subsequently  withdraws such approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em>  through (iii) of this section to maintain the 0.5-log credit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit an annual watershed control program status report to the  State. The annual watershed control program status report must describe  the system's implementation of the approved plan and assess the adequacy  of the plan to meet its goals. It must explain how the system is  addressing any shortcomings in plan implementation, including those  previously identified by the State or as the result of the watershed  survey conducted under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. It must  also describe any significant changes that have occurred in the  watershed since the last watershed sanitary survey. If a system  determines during implementation that making a significant change to its  approved watershed control program is necessary, the system must notify  the State prior to making any such changes. If any change is likely to  reduce the level of source water protection, the system must also list  in its notification the actions the system will take to mitigate this  effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Undergo a watershed sanitary survey every three years for  community water systems and every five years for noncommunity water  systems and submit the survey report to the State. The survey must be  conducted according to State guidelines and by persons the State  approves.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The watershed sanitary survey must meet the following criteria:  encompass the region identified in the State-approved watershed control  plan as the area of influence; assess the implementation of actions to  reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels; and identify any significant  new sources of Cryptosporidium.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the State determines that significant changes may have  occurred in the watershed since the previous watershed sanitary survey,  systems must undergo another watershed sanitary survey by a date the  State requires, which may be earlier than the regular   date in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The system must make the watershed control plan, annual status  reports, and watershed sanitary survey reports available to the public  upon request. These documents must be in a plain language style and  include criteria by which to evaluate the success of the program in  achieving plan goals. The State may approve systems to withhold from the  public portions of the annual status report, watershed control plan, and  watershed sanitary survey based on water supply security considerations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the State determines that a system is not carrying out the  approved watershed control plan, the State may withdraw the watershed  control program treatment credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative source. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A system may conduct source water  monitoring that reflects a different intake location (either in the same  source or for an alternate source) or a different procedure for the  timing or level of withdrawal from the source (alternative source  monitoring). If the State approves, a system may determine its bin  classification under Sec.  141.710 based on the alternative source  monitoring results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If systems conduct alternative source monitoring under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, systems must also monitor their current plant  intake concurrently as described in Sec.  141.701.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternative source monitoring under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section must meet the requirements for source monitoring to determine  bin classification, as described in Sec. Sec.  141.701 through 141.706.  Systems must report the alternative source monitoring results to the  State, along with supporting information documenting the operating  conditions under which the samples were collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a system determines its bin classification under Sec.   141.710 using alternative source monitoring results that reflect a  different intake location or a different procedure for managing the  timing or level of withdrawal from the source, the system must relocate  the intake or permanently adopt the withdrawal procedure, as applicable,  no later than the applicable treatment compliance date in Sec.  141.713.</p>
