                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of section 190 and the regulations thereunder:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses. The  term architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses means  expenditures for the purpose of making any facility, or public  transportation vehicle, owned or leased by the taxpayer for use in  connection with his trade or business more accessible to, or usable by,  handicapped individuals or elderly individuals. For purposes of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term facility means all or any portion of buildings,  structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or similar real or  personal property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term public transportation vehicle means a vehicle, such as  a bus, a railroad car, or other conveyance, which provides to the public  general or special transportation service (including such service  rendered to the customers of a taxpayer who is not in the trade or  business of rendering transportation services).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term handicapped individual means any individual who has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A physical or mental disability (including, but not limited to,  blindness or deafness) which for such individual constitutes or results  in a functional limitation to employment, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A physical or mental impairment (including, but not limited to,  a sight or hearing impairment) which substantially limits one or more of  such individual's major life activities, such as performing manual  tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, or working.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term elderly individual means an individual age 65 or over.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified architectual and transportation barrier removal  expense--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term qualified architectural and  transportation barrier removal expense means an architectural or  transportation barrier removal expense (as defined in paragraph (a) of  this section) with respect to which the taxpayer establishes, to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, that the resulting  removal of any such barrier conforms a facility or public transportation  vehicle to all the requirements set forth in one or more of paragraphs  (b) (2) through (22) of this section or in   one or more of the subdivisions of paragraph (b) (20) or (21). Such term  includes only expenses specifically attributable to the removal of an  existing architectural or transportation barrier. It does not include  any part of any expense paid or incurred in connection with the  construction or comprehensive renovation of a facility or public  transportation vehicle or the normal replacement of depreciable  property. Such term may include expenses of construction, as, for  example, the construction of a ramp to remove the barrier posed for  wheelchair users by steps. Major portions of the standards set forth in  this paragraph were adapted from ``American National Standard  Specifications for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to, and  Usable by, the Physically Handicapped'' (1971), the copyright for which  is held by the American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New  York, New York 10018.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grading.

If a door swings out onto the platform toward the walk, such  platform shall be at least 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide.
