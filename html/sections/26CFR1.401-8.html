                                Sec. 1.401-8  Custodial accounts prior to January 1, 1974.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of a custodial account as a qualified trust. For taxable years of a plan beginning after December 31, 1962, a custodial account may be used, in lieu of a trust, under any pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan, described in section 401 if the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met. A custodial account may be used under such a plan, whether the plan covers common-law employees, self-employed individuals who are treated as employees by reason of section 401(c), or both. The use of a custodial account as part of a plan does not preclude the use of a trust or another custodial account as part of the same plan. A plan under which a custodial account is used may be considered in connection with other plans of the employer in determining whether the requirements of section 401 are satisfied. For regulations relating to the period after December 31, 1973, see Sec. 1.401(f)-11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rules applicable to custodial accounts. (1) A custodial account shall be treated for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, as a qualified trust under section 401 if such account meets the following requirements described in subdivisions (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A custodial account shall be treated for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, as a qualified trust under section 401 if such account meets the following requirements described in subdivisions (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The custodial account must satisfy all the requirements of section 401 that are applicable to qualified trusts. See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The custodian of the custodial account must be a bank.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The custodial agreement provides that the investment of the funds in the account is to be made--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Solely in stock of one or more regulated investment companies which is registered in the name of the custodian or its nominee and with respect to which an employee who is covered by the plan is the beneficial owner, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Solely in annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, issued by an insurance company and held by the custodian until distributed pursuant to the terms of the plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a face-amount certificate described in section 401(g) and Sec. 1.401-9 is treated as an annuity issued by an insurance company.
See subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As a result of the requirement described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (relating to the requirements applicable to qualified trusts), the custodial account must, for example, be created pursuant to a written agreement which constitutes a valid contract under local law. In addition, the terms of the contract must make it impossible, prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to the employees and their beneficiaries covered by the plan, for any part of the funds of the custodial account to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees or their beneficiaries as provided for in the plan (see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.401-2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirement described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, relating to the investment of the funds of the plan, applies, for example, to the employer contributions under the plan, any employee contributions under the plan, and any earnings on such contributions. Such requirement also applies to capital gains realized upon the sale of stock described in (A) of such subdivision, to any capital gain dividends received in connection with such stock, and to any refunds described in section 852(b)(3)(D)(ii) (relating to undistributed capital gains of a regulated investment company) which is received in connection with such stock. However, since such requirement relates only to the investment of the funds of the plan, the custodian may deposit funds with a bank, in either a checking or savings account, while accumulating sufficient funds to make additional investments or while awaiting an appropriate time to make additional investments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirement in subparagraph (1)(iii)(A) of this paragraph that an employee covered by the plan be the beneficial owner of the stock does not mean

that the employee who is the beneficial owner must have a nonforfeitable interest in the stock. Thus, a plan may provide for forfeitures of an employee's interest in such stock in the same manner as plans which use a trust. In the event of a forfeiture of an employee's beneficial ownership in the stock of a regulated investment company, the beneficial ownership of such stock must pass to another employee covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of qualification. (1) Any custodial account which satisfies the requirements of section 401(f) shall be treated as a qualified trust for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Accordingly, such a custodial account shall be treated as a separate legal person which is exempt from the income tax by section 501(a). On the other hand, such a custodial account is required to file the returns described in sections 6033 and 6047 and to supply any other information which a qualified trust is required to furnish.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any custodial account which satisfies the requirements of section 401(f) shall be treated as a qualified trust for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Accordingly, such a custodial account shall be treated as a separate legal person which is exempt from the income tax by section 501(a). On the other hand, such a custodial account is required to file the returns described in sections 6033 and 6047 and to supply any other information which a qualified trust is required to furnish.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether the funds of a custodial account are distributed or made available to an employee or his beneficiary, the rules which under section 402(a) are applicable to trusts will also apply to the custodial account as though it were a separate legal person and not an agent of the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of loss of qualification. If a custodial account which has qualified under section 401 fails to qualify under such section for any taxable year, such custodial account will not thereafter be treated as a separate legal person, and the funds in such account shall be treated as made available within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) to the employees for whom they are held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term bank means a bank as defined in section 401(d)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term regulated investment company means any domestic corporation which issues only redeemable stock and is a regulated investment company within the meaning of section 851(a) (but without regard to whether such corporation meets the limitations of section 851(b)).
