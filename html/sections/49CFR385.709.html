                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a carrier is assigned an ``Unsatisfactory'' safety rating following a compliance review conducted under this subpart, FMCSA will provide the carrier written notice, as soon as practicable, that its registration will be suspended effective 15 days from the service date of the notice unless the carrier demonstrates, within 10 days of the service date of the notice, that the compliance review contains material error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section, material error is a mistake or series of mistakes that resulted in an erroneous safety rating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the carrier demonstrates that the compliance review contained material error, its new entrant registration will not be suspended. If the carrier fails to show a material error in the compliance review, FMCSA will issue an Order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Suspending the carrier's new entrant registration and requiring it to immediately cease all further operations in the United States; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notifying the carrier that its new entrant registration will be revoked unless it presents evidence of necessary corrective action within 30 days from the service date of the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a carrier is assigned a ``Conditional'' rating following a compliance review conducted under this subpart, the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section will apply, except that its new entrant registration will not be suspended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a carrier subject to this subpart fails to provide the necessary documents for a compliance review upon reasonable request, or fails to submit evidence of the necessary corrective action as required by Sec. 385.705 of this subpart, FMCSA will provide the carrier with written notice, as soon as practicable, that its new entrant registration will be suspended 15 days from the service date of the notice unless it provides all necessary documents or information. This suspension will remain in effect until the necessary documents or information is produced and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The carrier is rated Satisfactory after a compliance review; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FMCSA determines, following review of the carrier's response to a demand for corrective action under Sec. 385.705, that the carrier has taken the necessary corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a carrier commits any of the actions specified in Sec. 385.705(a) of this subpart after the removal of a suspension issued under this section, the suspension will be automatically reinstated. FMCSA will issue an Order requiring the carrier to cease further operations in the United States and demonstrate, within 15 days from the service date of the Order, that it did not commit the alleged action(s). If the carrier fails to demonstrate that it did not commit

the action(s), FMCSA will issue an Order revoking its new entrant registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If FMCSA receives credible evidence that a carrier has operated in violation of a suspension order issued under this section, it will issue an Order requiring the carrier to show cause, within 10 days of the service date of the Order, why its new entrant registration should not be revoked. If the carrier fails to make the necessary showing, FMCSA will revoke its registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a non-North America-domiciled motor carrier operates a commercial motor vehicle in violation of a suspension or out-of-service order, it is subject to the penalty provisions in 49 U.S.C. 521(b)(2)(A), as adjusted by inflation, not to exceed amounts for each offense under part 386, Appendix B of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, a carrier subject to this subpart is also subject to the suspension and revocation provisions of 49 U.S.C. 13905 for repeated violations of DOT regulations governing its motor carrier operations.</p>
