Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier stages should also be checked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amplitude of spurious emissions which are attenuated more than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise specified, measurements above 40 GHz shall be performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz.
