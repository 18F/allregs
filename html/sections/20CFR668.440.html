                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Beginning with PY 2000, supplemental youth funding will be  allocated to eligible INA grantees on the basis of the relative number  of Native American youth between the ages of 14 and 21, inclusive, in  the grantee's designated INA service area as compared to the number of  Native American youth in other eligible INA service areas. We reserve  the right to redetermine this youth funding stream in future program  years, in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training  Council, as program experience warrants and as appropriate data become  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The data used to implement this formula is provided by the U.S.  Bureau of the Census.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> also  applies to supplemental youth services funding. This factor also will be  determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native  American Employment and Training Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> also apply to  supplemental youth services funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.</p>
