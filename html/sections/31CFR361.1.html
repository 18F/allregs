Failure by any consignor or agent or employee thereof to comply with these regulations may delay recoveries, preclude reimbursement from the fund for the payment of Government losses in shipment (hereafter the Fund) or other relief under the Act, and render the consignor responsible for any loss occurring through such failure.</p>
