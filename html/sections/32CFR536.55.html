In the case of a minor, every effort should be made to  insure that the minor, and not the parents, receives the benefit of the  settlement. Annuity payments at the age of majority should be  considered. If rejected, a blocked bank account may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is the policy of the Department of Justice never to discuss  the tax-free nature of a structured settlement.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.55: For further discussion, see DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-63.</p>
