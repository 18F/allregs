                                Sec. 9.101  Providing investment advice for a fee.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The term ``fiduciary capacity'' at Sec. 9.2(e) is  defined to include ``investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for  its investment advice.'' In other words, if a bank is providing  investment advice for a fee, then it is acting in a fiduciary capacity.  For purposes of that definition, ``investment adviser'' generally means  a national bank that provides advice or recommendations concerning the  purchase or sale of specific securities, such as a national bank engaged  in portfolio advisory and management activities (including acting as  investment adviser to a mutual fund). Additionally, the qualifying  phrase ``if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice'' excludes  those activities in which the investment advice is merely incidental to  other services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific activities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full-service brokerage. Engaging in  full-service brokerage may entail providing investment advice for a fee,  depending upon the commission structure and specific facts. Full-service  brokerage involves investment advice for a fee if a non-bank broker  engaged in that activity is considered an investment adviser under the  Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities not involving investment advice for a fee. The  following activities generally do not entail providing investment advice  for a fee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Financial advisory and counseling activities, including  strategic planning of a financial nature, merger and acquisition  advisory services, advisory and structuring services related to project  finance transactions, and providing market economic information to  customers in general;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Client-directed investment activities (i.e., the bank has no  investment discretion) where investment advice and research may be made  available to the client, but the fee does not depend on the provision of  investment advice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Investment advisory activities incidental to acting as a  municipal securities dealer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Real estate management services provided to other financial  institutions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Real estate consulting services, including acting as a finder in  locating, analyzing, and making recommendations regarding the purchase  of property, and making recommendations concerning the sale of property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Advisory activities concerning bridge loans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Advisory activities for homeowners' associations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Advisory activities concerning tax planning and structuring;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Investment advisory activities authorized by the OCC under 12  U.S.C. 24(Seventh) as incidental to the business of banking.
