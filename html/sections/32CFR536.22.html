                                Sec. 536.22  Claims investigative responsibility--General.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart addresses the investigation, processing, evaluation, and settlement of tort and tort-related claims for and against the United States. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to personnel claims (AR

27-20, chapter 11), or to claims under subpart G of this part, Sec. Sec. 536.114 through 536.116.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperation. Claims investigation requires team effort between the U.S. Army Claims Service (USARCS), command claims services, and area claims offices (ACOs) including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) District Offices, claims processing offices (CPOs), and unit claims officers. Essential to this effort is the immediate investigation of claims incidents. Prompt investigation depends on the timely reporting of claims incidents as well as continuous communication between all commands or echelons bearing claims responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification to USARCS. A CPO or an ACO receiving notice of a potentially compensable event (PCE) that requires investigation will immediately refer it to the appropriate claims office. The Commander USARCS will be notified of all major incidents involving serious injury or death or those in which property damage exceeds $50,000. A command claims service may delegate to an ACO the responsibility for advising USARCS of serious incidents and complying with mirror file requirements. A copy of the written delegation and any changes made thereafter will be forwarded to the Commander USARCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Geographic concept of responsibility. A command claims service or an ACO in whose geographic area a claims incident occurs is primarily responsible for initiating investigation and processing of any claim filed in the absence of a formal transfer of responsibility (see Sec. Sec. 536.30 through 536.36). DOD and Army organizations whose personnel are involved in the incident will cooperate with and assist the ACO, regardless of where the former may be located.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.22: See the parallel discussion at DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-1.</p>
