This reduces burdens on recipients that can result when multiple DoD offices separately administer grants and cooperative agreements they award to a given recipient. It also minimizes unnecessary duplication of field administration services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To further reduce burdens on recipients, the office responsible for performing field administration services for grants and cooperative agreements to a particular recipient shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, the same office that is assigned responsibility for performing field administration services for contracts awarded to that recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting activities and grants officers therefore shall use cross-servicing arrangements whenever practicable and, to the maximum extent possible, delegate responsibility for post-award administration to the cognizant grants administration offices identified in Sec. 22.710.</p>
