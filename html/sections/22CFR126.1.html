                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses and other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies to Belarus, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, and the Republic of the Sudan) or whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Information regarding certain other embargoes appears elsewhere in this section. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a Department of State notice published in the Federal Register. The exemptions provided in this subchapter, except Sec. Sec. 123.17, 126.4, and 126.6 of this subchapter or when the recipient is a U.S. Government department or agency, do not apply with respect to defense articles or defense services originating in or for export to any proscribed countries, areas, or persons identified in this section or to brokering activities involving such countries, areas, or persons. (See Sec. 129.7 of this subchapter, which imposes restrictions on brokering activities similar to those in this section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shipments. A defense article licensed or otherwise authorized for export, temporary import, reexport, or retransfer under this subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, aircraft, spacecraft, or other means of conveyance that is owned by, operated by, leased to, or leased from any of the proscribed countries, areas, or other persons referred to in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions that are prohibited by the embargo and that involve U.S. persons (see Sec. 120.15 of this subchapter) anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles or services of a type described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles or services of U.S. or foreign origin that are located inside or outside of the United States. United Nations Security Council arms embargoes include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following countries:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cote d'Ivoire (see also paragraph (q) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Democratic Republic of Congo (see also paragraph (i) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eritrea.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Iraq (see also paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Iran.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Lebanon (see also paragraph (t) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Liberia (see also paragraph (o) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Libya (see also paragraph (k) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> North Korea.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Somalia (see also paragraph (m) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The Republic of the Sudan (see also paragraph (v) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Terrorism. Exports to countries which the Secretary of State has determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism are contrary to the foreign policy of the United States and are thus subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801, note). The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, the Republic of the Sudan, and Syria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Proposed and final sales. No sale, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer of, and no proposal or presentation to

sell, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer, any defense articles or defense services subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in this section (including the embassies or consulates of such a country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in the United States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. However, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed and final sales. No sale, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer of, and no proposal or presentation to

sell, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer, any defense articles or defense services subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in this section (including the embassies or consulates of such a country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in the United States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. However, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duty to notify. Any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposed, final, or actual sale, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer of articles, services, or data as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must immediately inform the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Such notifications should be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (e): ``Proposal'' and ``presentation'' mean the communication of information in sufficient detail that it would permit an intended purchaser to decide to acquire the article in question or to enter into an agreement as described in part 124 of this subchapter. For example, communicating information on the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery would be a proposal or presentation requiring a license or other approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Iraq. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses or other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in Iraq, except that a license or other approval may be issued, on a case-by-case basis for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-lethal military equipment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lethal military equipment required by the Government of Iraq or coalition forces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Afghanistan. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses or other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in Afghanistan, except that a license or other approval may be issued, on a case-by-case basis, for the Government of Afghanistan or coalition forces. In addition, the names of individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities subject to arms embargoes, due to their affiliation with the Taliban, Al-Qaida, or those associated with them, are published in lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council's Sanctions Committees (established pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCR) 1267, 1988, and 1989).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Democratic Republic of the Congo.
