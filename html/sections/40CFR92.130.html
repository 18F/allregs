The  time-weighted concentration is determined by integrating the  concentration response (with respect to time in seconds) over the first  360 seconds (or 900 seconds for notch 8) of measurement, and dividing  the area by 360 seconds (or 900 seconds for notch 8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A steady-state concentration is considered representative of the  entire measurement period if the estimated peak area is not more than 10  percent of the product of the steady-state concentration and 360 seconds  (or 900 seconds for notch 8).
