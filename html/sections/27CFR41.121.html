Where the amount of a bonded manufacturer's bond is less than the maximum amount prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, the bonded manufacturer must maintain an account reflecting all outstanding taxes for which the manufacturer's bond is chargeable. A manufacturer must debit that account with the amount of tax that was agreed to be paid under Sec. 41.111 or that is otherwise chargeable against the bond and then must credit the account for the amount paid on TTB F 5000.25 or other TTB-prescribed document, at the time it is filed. A manufacturer who will defer payment of tax for a shipment of tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes under this subpart must have sufficient credit in this account to cover the taxes prior to making the shipment to the United States.
