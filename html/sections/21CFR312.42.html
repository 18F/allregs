                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A clinical hold is an order issued by FDA to the  sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an  ongoing investigation. The clinical hold order may apply to one or more  of the investigations covered by an IND. When a proposed study is placed  on clinical hold, subjects may not be given the investigational drug.  When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold, no new subjects may be  recruited to the study and placed on the investigational drug; patients  already in the study should be taken off therapy involving the  investigational drug unless specifically permitted by FDA in the  interest of patient safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grounds for imposition of clinical hold--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clinical hold of a  Phase 1 study under an IND. FDA may place a proposed or ongoing Phase 1  investigation on clinical hold if it finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and  significant risk of illness or injury;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The clinical investigators named in the IND are not qualified  by reason of their scientific training and experience to conduct the  investigation described in the IND;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The investigator brochure is misleading, erroneous, or  materially incomplete; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The IND does not contain sufficient information required under  Sec. 312.23 to assess the risks to subjects of the proposed studies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The IND is for the study of an investigational drug intended to  treat a life-threatening disease or condition that affects both genders,  and men or women with reproductive potential who have the disease or  condition being studied are excluded from eligibility because of a risk  or potential risk from use of the investigational drug of reproductive  toxicity (i.e., affecting reproductive organs) or developmental toxicity  (i.e., affecting potential offspring). The phrase ``women with  reproductive potential'' does not include pregnant women. For purposes  of this paragraph, ``life-threatening illnesses or diseases'' are  defined as ``diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is  high unless the course of the disease is interrupted.'' The clinical  hold would not apply under this paragraph to clinical studies conducted:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Under special circumstances, such as studies pertinent only to  one gender (e.g., studies evaluating the excretion of a drug in semen or  the effects on menstrual function);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Only in men or women, as long as a study that does not exclude  members of the other gender with reproductive potential is being  conducted concurrently, has been conducted, or will take place within a  reasonable time agreed upon by the agency; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Only in subjects who do not suffer from the disease or condition  for which the drug is being studied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clinical hold of a Phase 2 or 3 study under an IND. FDA may  place a proposed or ongoing Phase 2 or 3 investigation on clinical hold  if it finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> through (b)(1)(v)  of this section apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan or protocol for the investigation is clearly deficient  in design to meet its stated objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Clinical hold of an expanded access IND or expanded access  protocol. FDA may place an expanded access IND or expanded access  protocol on clinical hold under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Final use. FDA may place a proposed expanded access IND or  treatment use protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The pertinent criteria in subpart I of this part for permitting  the expanded access use to begin are not satisfied; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The expanded access IND or expanded access protocol does not  comply with the requirements for expanded access submissions in subpart  I of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ongoing use. FDA may place an ongoing expanded access IND or  expanded access protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that the  pertinent criteria in subpart I of this part for permitting the expanded  access are no longer satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Clinical hold of any study that is not designed to be adequate  and well-controlled. FDA may place a proposed or ongoing investigation  that is not designed to be adequate and well-controlled on clinical hold  if it finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any of the conditions in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this  section apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is reasonable evidence the investigation that is not  designed to be adequate and well-controlled is impeding enrollment in,  or otherwise interfering with the conduct or completion of, a study that  is designed to be an adequate and well-controlled investigation of the  same or another investigational drug; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Insufficient quantities of the investigational drug exist to  adequately conduct both the investigation that is not designed to be  adequate and well-controlled and the investigations that are designed to  be adequate and well-controlled; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The drug has been studied in one or more adequate and well- controlled investigations that strongly suggest lack of effectiveness;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Another drug under investigation or approved for the same  indication and available to the same patient population has demonstrated  a better potential benefit/risk balance; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The drug has received marketing approval for the same  indication in the same patient population; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The sponsor of the study that is designed to be an adequate  and well-controlled investigation is not actively pursuing marketing  approval of the investigational drug with due diligence; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The Commissioner determines that it would not be in the  public interest for the study to be conducted or continued. FDA  ordinarily intends that clinical holds under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii),  (b)(4)(iii) and (b)(4)(v) of this section would only apply to additional  enrollment in nonconcurrently controlled trials rather than eliminating  continued access to individuals already receiving the investigational  drug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Clinical hold of any investigation involving an exception from  informed consent under Sec. 50.24 of this chapter. FDA may place a  proposed or ongoing investigation involving an exception from informed  consent under Sec. 50.24 of this chapter on clinical hold if it is  determined that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this  section apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pertinent criteria in Sec. 50.24 of this chapter for such  an investigation to begin or continue are not submitted or not  satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Clinical hold of any investigation involving an exception from  informed consent under Sec. 50.23(d) of this chapter.   FDA may place a proposed or ongoing investigation involving an exception  from informed consent under Sec. 50.23(d) of this chapter on clinical  hold if it is determined that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this  section apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A determination by the President to waive the prior consent  requirement for the administration of an investigational new drug has  not been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Discussion of deficiency. Whenever FDA concludes that a  deficiency exists in a clinical investigation that may be grounds for  the imposition of clinical hold FDA will, unless patients are exposed to  immediate and serious risk, attempt to discuss and satisfactorily  resolve the matter with the sponsor before issuing the clinical hold  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Imposition of clinical hold. The clinical hold order may be made  by telephone or other means of rapid communication or in writing. The  clinical hold order will identify the studies under the IND to which the  hold applies, and will briefly explain the basis for the action. The  clinical hold order will be made by or on behalf of the Division  Director with responsibility for review of the IND. As soon as possible,  and no more than 30 days after imposition of the clinical hold, the  Division Director will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the  basis for the hold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Resumption of clinical investigations. An investigation may only  resume after FDA (usually the Division Director, or the Director's  designee, with responsibility for review of the IND) has notified the  sponsor that the investigation may proceed. Resumption of the affected  investigation(s) will be authorized when the sponsor corrects the  deficiency(ies) previously cited or otherwise satisfies the agency that  the investigation(s) can proceed. FDA may notify a sponsor of its  determination regarding the clinical hold by telephone or other means of  rapid communication. If a sponsor of an IND that has been placed on  clinical hold requests in writing that the clinical hold be removed and  submits a complete response to the issue(s) identified in the clinical  hold order, FDA shall respond in writing to the sponsor within 30- calendar days of receipt of the request and the complete response. FDA's  response will either remove or maintain the clinical hold, and will  state the reasons for such determination. Notwithstanding the 30- calendar day response time, a sponsor may not proceed with a clinical  trial on which a clinical hold has been imposed until the sponsor has  been notified by FDA that the hold has been lifted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appeal. If the sponsor disagrees with the reasons cited for the  clinical hold, the sponsor may request reconsideration of the decision  in accordance with Sec. 312.48.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conversion of IND on clinical hold to inactive status. If all  investigations covered by an IND remain on clinical hold for 1 year or  more, the IND may be placed on inactive status by FDA under Sec.  312.45.
