where:
``b'' is the breadth of the superstructure at the middle of its length;``Bs'' is the breadth of the vessel at the middle of the length of the</p><p class="depth2">superstructure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Where a superstructure is set in for a part of its length, this modification shall be applied only to the set in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the height of an enclosed superstructure is less than the standard height, the effective length shall be its length reduced in the ratio of the actual height to the standard height.
