                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The vibration test must be conducted for the  qualification of all rigid IBC design types. Flexible IBC design types  must be capable of withstanding the vibration test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test method. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sample IBC, selected at random, must be  filled and closed as for shipment. IBCs intended for liquids may be  tested using water as the filling material for the vibration test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sample IBC must be placed on a vibrating platform with a  vertical or rotary double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one  inch. The IBC must be constrained horizontally to prevent it from  falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically and  bounce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The test must be performed for one hour at a frequency that  causes the package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a  degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6-mm (0.063-inch)  thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between  the bottom of the IBC and the platform. Other methods at least equally  effective may be used (see Sec. 178.801(i)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for passing the test. An IBC passes the vibration test  if there is no rupture or leakage.
