will be issued. If a certificate of approval is issued, no test data or detailed results of tests will accompany it. If a notice of disapproval is issued, it will be accompanied by details of the defect(s), with a view to possible correction. MSHA will not disclose, except to the applicant, any information on a fluid upon which a notice of disapproval has been issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a list of specifications covering the characteristics of a hydraulic fluid upon which the certificate of approval is based. In addition to the applicant's record of control in maintaining the fire-resistant characteristics, applicants shall keep exact duplicates of the specifications that have been submitted to MSHA and that relate to any fluid which has received a certificate of approval; and these are to be adhered to exactly in production of the certified fluid for commercial purposes.</p>
