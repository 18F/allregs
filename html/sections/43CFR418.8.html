Possible irrigation of ineligible land will also be identified. The Bureau will review data to ensure compliance with this part.

The Bureau may also audit as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible land with transferred water rights. The District water rights maps dated August 1981 through January 1983 will be used as the basis for determining which lands have a valid water right. The original maps will be maintained by the District. The District must provide copies of the maps to the Bureau. The District will alter the maps and the copies to account for water right transfers as the transfers are approved by the Nevada State Engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other eligible land.
