Authority for the criminal law enforcement activities of the OIG's  Office of Investigations is the Inspector General Act of 1978, as  amended, 5 U.S.C. app. 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency's system of records, EPA-46 system of records is  maintained by the National Enforcement Investigations Center, Office of  Criminal Enforcement, Forensics, and Training, a component of EPA which  performs as its principal function activities pertaining to the  enforcement of criminal laws. Authority for the criminal law enforcement  activities comes from Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 (5 U.S.C. app.  1), effective December 2, 1970; Powers of Environmental Protection  Agency, 18 U.S.C. 3063; Comprehensive Environmental Response  Compensation and Liability Act , 42 U.S.C. 9603; Resource Conservation  and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6928; Federal Water Pollution Control Act,  33 U.S.C. 1319, 1321; Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2614,  2615; Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and  Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136j, 136l; Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C.  300h-2, 300i-1; Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of  1986,   42 U.S.C. 11045; and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries  Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1415.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (4)(H), and (f)(2)  through (5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reasons for exemption. EPA systems of records 17, 40, and 46 are  exempted from the above provisions of the PA for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make the accounting of  each disclosure of records available to the individual named in the  record upon request. These accountings must state the date, nature, and  purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the  recipient. Accounting for each disclosure would alert the subjects of an  investigation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that  they are subjects of the investigation. The release of such information  to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant  information concerning the nature of the investigation, and could  seriously impede or compromise the investigation, endanger the physical  safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel and  their families, and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the  destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or  other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the  agency in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since EPA is  claiming that these systems of records are exempt from subsection (d) of  the Act, concerning access to records, this section is inapplicable and  is exempted to the extent that these systems of records are exempted  from subsection (d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to  gain access to records pertaining to him or her, to request amendment to  such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend  such records, and to contest the information contained in such records.  Granting access to records in these systems of records could inform the  subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation  of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the  information and evidence obtained as to his activities, of the identity  of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and  could provide information to enable the subject to avoid detection or  apprehension. Granting access to such information could seriously impede  or compromise an investigation, endanger the physical safety of  confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel and their  families, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction  of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative  techniques and procedures. In addition, granting access to such  information could disclose classified, security-sensitive, or  confidential business information and could constitute an unwarranted  invasion of the personal privacy of others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its  records only such information about an individual as is relevant and  necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or  by Executive order of the President. The application of this provision  could impair investigations and law enforcement, because it is not  always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of specific  information in the early stages of an investigation. Relevance and  necessity are often questions of judgment and timing, and it is only  after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of  such information can be established. In addition, during the course of  the investigation, the investigator may obtain information which is  incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which may relate  to matters under   the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information  cannot readily be segregated. Furthermore, during the course of the  investigation, the investigator may obtain information concerning the  violation of laws other than those which are within the scope of his  jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the EPA  investigators should retain this information, since it can aid in  establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable  leads for other law enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to  the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual  when the information may result in adverse determinations about an  individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.  The application of this provision could impair investigations and law  enforcement by alerting the subject of an investigation of the existence  of the investigation, enabling the subject to avoid detection or  apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or  to fabricate testimony. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the subject  of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to  investigators, and information must be collected from other sources.  Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect information from sources  other than the subject of the investigation to verify the accuracy of  the evidence collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person  whom it asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by  the person, of the authority under which the information is sought and  whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes  for which the information is intended to be used; of the routine uses  which may be made of the information; and of the effects on the person,  if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.  The application of this provision could provide the subject of an  investigation with substantial information about the nature of that  investigation, which could interfere with the investigation. Moreover,  providing such a notice to the subject of an investigation could  seriously impede or compromise on undercover investigation by revealing  its existence and could endanger the physical safety of confidential  sources, witnesses, and investigators by revealing their identities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) (G) and (H) require an agency to publish a  Federal Register notice concerning its procedures for notifying an  individual at his request if the system of records contains a record  pertaining to him or her, how to gain access to such a record, and how  to contest its content. Since EPA is claiming that these systems of  records are exempted from parts of subsection (f)(2) through (5) of the  Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning  access to records, these requirements are inapplicable and are exempted  to the extent that these systems of records are exempted from  subsections (f) and (d) of the Act. Although EPA is claiming exemption  from these requirements, the Agency has published such a notice  concerning its notification, access, and contest procedures because,  under certain circumstances, EPA might decide it is appropriate for an  individual to have access to all or a portion of the individual's  records in these systems of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records  with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is  reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any  determination about the individual. Since the Act defines maintain to  include the collection of information, complying with this provision  would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate,  relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In  collecting information for criminal law enforcement purposes, it is not  possible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant,  timely, and complete. Facts are first gathered and then placed into a  logical order to prove or disprove objectively the criminal behavior of  an individual. Material that may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or  incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as  the investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could  interfere   with the preparation of a complete investigative report, thereby  impeding effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable  efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such  individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal  process when such process becomes a matter of public record. Complying  with this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal  investigation to the subject of the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules  which shall establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified  in response to his request if any system of records named by the  individual contains a record pertaining to him or her. Since EPA is  claiming that these systems of records are exempt from subsection (d) of  the Act, concerning access to records, the requirements of subsections  (f)(2) through (5) of the Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining  access to such records, are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent  that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d) of the  Act. Although EPA is claiming exemption from the requirements of  subsection (f)(2) through (5) of the Act, EPA has promulgated rules  which establish Agency procedures because, under certain circumstances,  it might be appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a  portion of his records in these systems of records. These procedures are  described elsewhere in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails  to comply with the requirements concerning access to records under  subsections (d)(1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under  subsection (e)(5) of the Act; and any other provision of the Act, or any  rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect  on an individual. Since EPA is claiming that these systems of records  are exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3),  (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5), and (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisions  of subsection (g) of the Act are inapplicable and are exempted to the  extent that these systems of records are exempted from those subsections  of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exempt records provided by another agency. Individuals may not  have access to records maintained by the EPA if such records were  provided by another Federal agency which has determined by regulation  that such records are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C.  552a(j). If an individual requests access to such exempt records, EPA  will consult with the source agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exempt records included in a nonexempt system of records. All  records obtained from a system of records that has been determined by  regulation to be subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)  retain their exempt status even if such records are also included in a  system of records for which a general exemption has not been claimed.</p>
