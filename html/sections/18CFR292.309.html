                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After August 8, 2005, an electric utility shall not be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electric energy from a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility if the Commission finds that the qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power facility production has nondiscriminatory access to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale markets for the sale of electric energy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale markets for the sale of electric energy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Transmission and interconnection services that are provided by a Commission-approved regional transmission entity and administered pursuant to an open access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transmission and interconnection services that are provided by a Commission-approved regional transmission entity and administered pursuant to an open access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the qualifying facility is interconnected. In determining whether a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of transactions within the relevant market; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of Sec. 292.309(a), a renewal of a contract that expires by its own terms is a ``new contract or obligation'' without a continuing obligation to purchase under an expired contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of Sec. 292.309(a)(1), (2) and (3), with the exception of paragraph (d) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory access to the market if it is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, and Commission-approved interconnection rules. If the Commission determines that a market meets the criteria of Sec. 292.309(a)(1), (2) or (3), and if a qualifying facility in the relevant market is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, a qualifying facility may seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating, inter alia, that it does not have access to the market because of operational characteristics or transmission constraints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> For purposes of Sec. 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3), there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility with a capacity at or below 20 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of Sec. 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3), there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility with a capacity at or below 20 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of implementing paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Commission will not be bound by the one-mile standard set forth in Sec. 292.204(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (Midwest ISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), ISO New England, Inc. (ISO-NE), and New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) qualify as markets described in Sec. 292.309(a)(1)(i) and (ii), and there is a rebuttable presumption that qualifying facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to those markets through Commission-approved open access transmission tariffs and interconnection rules, and that electric utilities that are members of such regional transmission organizations or independent system operators (RTO/ISOs) should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from

the qualifying facilities. A qualifying facility may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating, inter alia, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) qualifies as a market described in Sec. 292.309(a)(3), and there is a rebuttable presumption that qualifying facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to that market through Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved open access protocols, and that electric utilities that operate within ERCOT should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities. A qualifying facility may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating, inter alia, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints.
