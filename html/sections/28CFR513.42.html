                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for the limitations of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section, an inmate may review records from his or her medical file  (including dental records) by submitting a request to a staff member  designated by the Warden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Laboratory reports which contain only scientific testing results  and which contain no staff evaluation or opinion (such as Standard Form  514A, Urinalysis) are ordinarily disclosable. Lab results of HIV testing  may be reviewed by the inmate. However, an inmate may not retain a copy  of his or her test results while the inmate is confined in a Bureau  facility or a Community Corrections Center. A copy of an inmate's HIV  test results may be forwarded to a third party outside the institution  and chosen by the inmate, provided that the inmate gives written  authorization for the disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medical records containing subjective evaluations and opinions  of medical staff relating to the inmate's care and treatment will be  provided to the inmate only after the staff review required by paragraph  (d) of this section. These records include, but are not limited to,  outpatient notes, consultation reports, narrative summaries or reports  by a specialist, operative reports by the physician, summaries by  specialists as the result of laboratory analysis, or in-patient progress  reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior to release to the inmate, records described in paragraph  (c) of this section shall be reviewed by staff to determine if the  release of this information would present a harm to either the inmate or  other individuals. Any records determined not to present a harm will be  released to the inmate at the conclusion of the review by staff. If any  records are determined by staff not to be releasable based upon the  presence of harm, the inmate will be so advised in writing and provided  the address of the agency component to which the inmate may address a  formal request for the withheld records. An accounting of any medical  records will be maintained in the inmate's medical file.</p>
