A PHA must operate an FSS program of the minimum program size determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum program size requirement. A PHA must operate an FSS program of the minimum program size determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception or reduction of minimum program size. Paragraph (c) of this section states when HUD may grant an exception to the minimum program size requirement, and paragraph (d) states when the minimum program size may be reduced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Option to operate larger FSS program. A PHA may choose to operate an FSS program of a larger size than the minimum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How to determine FSS minimum program size--(1) Public housing. The minimum size of a PHA's public housing FSS program is equal to the number of public housing units specified below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public housing. The minimum size of a PHA's public housing FSS program is equal to the number of public housing units specified below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total number of public housing units reserved in FY 1993 through October 20, 1998; plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of public housing units reserved in FY 1991 and FY 1992 under the FSS incentive award competitions; minus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number of families that have graduated from the PHA's public housing FSS program on or after October 21, 1998, by fulfilling their FSS contract of participation obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 8. The minimum size of a PHA's Section 8 FSS program is equal to the number of Section 8 certificate and voucher program units as calculated below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Units included.

When determining a PHA's minimum Section 8 FSS program size, funding reserved in FY 1993 through October 20, 1998 for the following program categories is excluded (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Funding for families affected by termination, expiration or owner opt-out under Section 8 project-based programs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Funding for families affected by demolition or disposition of a public housing project or replacement of a public housing project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Funding for families affected by conversion of assistance from the Section 23 leased housing or housing assistance payments programs to the Section 8 program;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Funding for families affected by the sale of a HUD-owned project; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Funding for families affected by the prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of mortgage insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintaining minimum program size. The minimum program size for a PHA's public housing or Section 8 FSS program is reduced by one slot for each family that graduates from the FSS program by fulfilling its FSS contract of participation on or after October 21, 1998. If an FSS slot is vacated by a family that has not completed its FSS contract of participation obligations, the slot must be filled by a replacement family which has been selected in accordance with the FSS family selection procedures set forth in Sec. 984.203.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception to program operation. (1) Upon approval by HUD, a PHA will not be required to establish and carry out a public housing or a Section 8 FSS program if the PHA provides to HUD a certification, as defined in Sec. 984.103, that the establishment and operation of such an FSS program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon approval by HUD, a PHA will not be required to establish and carry out a public housing or a Section 8 FSS program if the PHA provides to HUD a certification, as defined in Sec. 984.103, that the establishment and operation of such an FSS program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lack of accessible supportive services funding, including lack of the availability of programs under JTPA or JOBS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lack of funding for reasonable administrative costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Lack of cooperation by other units of State or local government; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Lack of interest in participating in the FSS program on the part of eligible families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exception will not be granted if HUD determines that local circumstances do not preclude the PHA from effectively operating an FSS program that is smaller than the minimum program size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reduction in program size.
