Guidelines concerning possible exceptions  to this provision appear in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consideration of any of the following factors in connection with  a real estate-related loan is not necessary to a Federal credit union's  business, generally has a discriminatory effect, and is therefore  prohibited:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The age or location of the dwelling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Zip code of the applicant's current residence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Previous home ownership;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the  dwelling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The income level of residents in the neighborhood of the  dwelling.

Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this  provision appear in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Federal credit union may not rely upon an appraisal that it  knows or should know is based upon consideration of any of the following  criteria, for such criteria generally have a discriminatory effect, and  are not necessary to a Federal credit union's business:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The age or location of the dwelling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the  dwelling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The income level of the residents in the neighborhood of the  dwelling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is  recognized that there may be factors concerning location of the dwelling  which can be properly considered in an appraisal. If any such factor(s)  is relied upon, it must be specifically documented in the appraisal,  accompanied by a brief statement demonstrating the necessity of using  such factor(s). Guidelines concerning the consideration of location  factors appear in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each Federal credit union shall make available, to any  requesting member/applicant, a copy of the appraisal used in connection  with that member's real estate-related loan application. The appraisal  shall be available for a period of 25 months after the applicant has  received notice from the Federal credit union of the action taken by the  Federal credit union on the real estate-related loan application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nondiscrimination in advertising. No federal credit union may  engage in any form of advertising of real estate-related loans that  indicates the credit union discriminates on the basis of race, color,  religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status in  violation of the Fair Housing Act. Advertisements must not contain any  words, symbols, models or other forms of communication that suggest a  discriminatory preference or policy of exclusion in violation of the  Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advertising notice of nondiscrimination compliance. Any federal  credit union that advertises real estate-related loans must prominently  indicate in such advertisement, in a manner appropriate to the  advertising medium and format used, that the credit union makes such  loans without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  handicap, or familial status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With respect to written and visual advertisements, a credit  union may satisfy the notice requirement by including in the  advertisement a copy of the logotype, with the legend ``Equal Housing  Lender,'' from the poster described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section  or a copy of the logotype, with the legend ``Equal Housing  Opportunity,'' from the poster described in Sec. 110.25(a) of the United  States Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) regulations  (24 CFR 110.25(a)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to oral advertisements, a credit union may satisfy  the notice requirement by a spoken statement that the credit union is an  ``Equal Housing Lender'' or an ``Equal Opportunity Lender.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When an oral advertisement is used in conjunction with a  written or visual advertisement, the use of either of the methods  specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section will satisfy  the notice requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A credit union may use any other method reasonably calculated  to satisfy the notice requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lobby notice of nondiscrimination. Every federal credit union  that engages in real estate-related lending must display a notice of  nondiscrimination. The notice must be placed in the public lobby of the  credit union and in the public area of each office where such loans are  made and must be clearly visible to the general public. The notice must  incorporate either a facsimile of the logotype and language appearing in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section or the logotype and language appearing  at 24 CFR 110.25(a). Posters containing the logotype and language  appearing in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may be obtained from the  regional offices of the National Credit Union Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Logotype and notice of nondiscrimination compliance. The  logotype and text of the notice required in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section shall be as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21MR12.003</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Guidelines. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with the Fair Housing Act is achieved  when each loan applicant's creditworthiness is evaluated on an  individual basis, without presuming that the applicant has certain  characteristics of a group.   If certain lending policies or procedures do presume group  characteristics, they may violate the Fair Housing Act, even though the  characteristics are not based upon race, color, sex, national origin,  religion, handicap, or familial status. Such a violation occurs when  otherwise facially nondiscriminatory lending procedures (either general  lending policies or specific criteria used in reviewing loan  applications) have the effect of making real estate-related loans  unavailable or less available on the basis of race, color, sex, national  origin, religion, handicap, or familial status. Note, however, that a  policy or criterion which has a discriminatory effect is not a violation  of the Fair Housing Act if its use achieves a legitimate business  necessity which cannot be achieved by using less discriminatory  standards. It is also important to note that the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act and Regulation B prohibit discrimination, either per se  or in effect, on the basis of the applicant's age, marital status,  receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any rights under the  Consumer Credit Protection Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (b)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of  certain factors because of their likely discriminatory effect and  because they are not necessary to make sound real estate-related loans.  For purposes of clarification, the prohibited use of location factors in  this section is intended to prevent abandonment of areas in which a  Federal credit union's members live or want to live. It is not intended  to require loans in those areas that are geographically remote from the  FCU's main or branch offices or that contravene the parameters of a  Federal credit union's charter. Further, this prohibition does not  preclude requiring a borrower to obtain flood insurance protection  pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act and part 760 of NCUA's  Rules and Regulations, nor does it preclude involvement with Federal or  state housing insurance programs which provide for lower interest rates  for the purchase of homes in certain urban or rural areas. Also, the  legitimate use of location factors in an appraisal does not constitute a  violation of the provision of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, which  prohibits consideration of location of the dwelling. Finally, the  prohibited use of prior home ownership does not preclude a Federal  credit union from considering an applicant's payment history on a loan  which was made to obtain a home. Such action entails consideration of  the payment record on a previous loan in determining creditworthiness;  it does not entail consideration of prior home ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Paragraph (c)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of  the age or location of a dwelling in a real estate-related loan  appraisal. These restrictions are intended to prohibit the use of  unfounded or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan  risk of the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic  characteristics of an area. Appraisals should be based on the present  market value of the property offered as security (including  consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower) and  the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value over the  term of the loan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``age of the dwelling'' does not encompass structural  soundness. In addition, the age of the dwelling may be used by an  appraiser as a basis for conducting further inspections of certain  structural aspects of the dwelling. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section  does, however, prohibit an unsubstantiated determination that a house  over X years in age is not structurally sound.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to location factors, paragraph (c)(4) of this  section recognizes that there may be location factors which may be  considered in an appraisal, and requires that the use of any such  factors be specifically documented in the appraisal. These factors will  most often be those location factors which may negatively affect the  short range future value (up to 3-5 years) of a property. Factors which  in some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are  recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the  immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will  cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings  may not   affect the market value of a property because the cause of abandonment  is unrelated to high risk. Proper considerations include the condition  and utility of the improvement and various physical factors such as  street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreation areas,  availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposure to  flooding and land faults.
