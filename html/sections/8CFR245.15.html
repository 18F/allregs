                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section, the terms:</p><p class="depth0">Abandoned and abandonment mean that both parents have, or the sole  or surviving parent has, or in the case of a child who has been placed  into a guardianship, the child's guardian or guardians have, willfully  forsaken all parental or guardianship rights, obligations, and claims to  the child, as well as all control over and possession of the child,  without intending to transfer these rights to any specific person(s).</p><p class="depth0">Guardian means a person lawfully invested (by order of a competent  Federal, State, or local authority) with the power, and charged with the  duty, of taking care of, including managing the property, rights, and  affairs of, a child.</p><p class="depth0">Orphan and orphaned refer to the involuntary detachment or severance  of a child from his or her parents due to any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The death or disappearance of, desertion by, or separation or  loss from both parents, as those terms are defined in Sec. 204.3(b) of  this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The irrevocable and written release of all parental rights by  the sole parent, as that term is defined in Sec. 204.3(b) of this  chapter, based upon the inability of that parent to provide proper care  (within the meaning of that phrase in Sec. 204.3(b) of this chapter)  for the child, provided that at the time of such irrevocable release  such parent is legally obligated to provide such care; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The death or disappearance, as that term is defined in Sec.  204.3(b) of this chapter, of one parent and the irrevocable and written  release of all parental rights by the sole remaining parent based upon  the inability of that parent to provide proper care (within the meaning  of that phrase in Sec. 204.3(b) of this chapter) for the child,  provided that at the time of such irrevocable release such parent is  legally obligated to provide such care.</p><p class="depth0">Parent, father, or mother means a parent, father, or mother only  where the relationship exists by reason of any of   the circumstances set forth in paragraphs (A) through (E) of section  101(b)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Sole remaining parent means a person who is the child's only parent  because:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The child's other parent has died; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The child's other parent has been certified by competent Haitian  authorities to be presumed dead as a result of his or her disappearance,  within the meaning of that term as set forth in Sec. 204.3(b) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of provisions of section 902 of HRIFA in general.  Section 902 of Division A of Pub. L. 105-277, the Haitian Refugee  Immigrant Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA), provides special rules for  adjustment of status for certain nationals of Haiti, and without regard  to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, if they meet the other requirements of  HRIFA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of HRIFA defines five  categories of principal applicants who may apply for adjustment of  status, if the alien was physically present in the United States on  December 31, 1995:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An alien who filed for asylum before December 31, 1995;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who was paroled into the United States prior to  December 31, 1995, after having been identified as having a credible  fear of persecution, or paroled for emergent reasons or reasons deemed  strictly in the public interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An alien who at the time of arrival in the United States and  on December 31, 1995, was unmarried and under 21 years of age and who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Arrived in the United States without parents in the United  States and has remained, without parents, in the United States since his  or her arrival;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Became orphaned subsequent to arrival in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Was abandoned by parents or guardians prior to April 1, 1998,  and has remained abandoned since such abandonment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dependents. Section 902(d) of HRIFA provides for certain Haitian  nationals to apply for adjustment of status as the spouse, child, or  unmarried son or daughter of a principal HRIFA beneficiary, even if the  individual would not otherwise be eligible for adjustment under section  902. The eligibility requirements for dependents are described further  in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility of principal HRIFA applicants. A Haitian national  who is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is eligible to  apply for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 902 of  HRIFA if the alien meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical presence. The alien is physically present in the United  States at the time the application is filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proper application. The alien properly files an application for  adjustment of status in accordance with this section, including the  evidence described in paragraphs (h), (i), (j), and (k) of this section.  For purposes of Sec. 245.15 of this chapter only, an Application to  Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) submitted by  a principal applicant for benefits under HRIFA may be considered to have  been properly filed if it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is received not later than March 31, 2000, at the Nebraska  Service Center, the Board, or the Immigration Court having jurisdiction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has been properly completed and signed by the applicant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identifies the provision of HRIFA under which the applicant is  seeking adjustment of status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is accompanied by either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The correct fee as specified in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this  chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A request for a fee waiver in accordance with Sec. 103.7(c) of  this chapter, provided such fee waiver request is subsequently granted;  however, if such a fee waiver request is subsequently denied and the  applicant submits the require fee within 30 days of the date of any  notice that the fee waiver request had been denied, the application  shall be regarded as having been filed before the statutory deadline. In  addition, in a case over which the Board has jurisdiction, an  application received by the Board before April 1, 2000, that has been  properly signed and executed shall be considered filed before the  statutory deadline without payment of the fee or submission of a fee  waiver request. Upon remand by the Board, the payment of the fee or a  request for a fee waiver shall be made upon submission   of the application to the Immigration Court in accordance with 8 CFR  240.11(f). If a request for a fee waiver is denied, the application  shall be considered as having been properly filed with the Immigration  Court before the statutory deadline provided that the applicant submits  the required fee within 30 days of the date of any notice that the fee  waiver request has been denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Admissibility. The alien is not inadmissible to the United  States for permanent residence under any provisions of section 212(a) of  the Act, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continuous physical presence. The alien has been physically  present in the United States for a continuous period beginning on  December 31, 1995, and ending on the date the application for adjustment  is granted, except for the following periods of time:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any period or periods of absence from the United States not  exceeding 180 days in the aggregate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any periods of absence for which the applicant received an  advance parole authorization prior to his or her departure from the  United States, provided the applicant returned to the United States in  accordance with the conditions of such authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any periods of absence from the United States occurring after  October 21, 1998, and before July 12, 1999, provided the applicant  departed the United States prior to December 31, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility of dependents of a principal HRIFA beneficiary. A  Haitian national who is the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter  of a principal beneficiary eligible for adjustment of status under the  provisions of HRIFA is eligible to apply for benefits as a dependent, if  the dependent alien meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical presence. The alien is physically present in the United  States at the time the application is filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proper application. The alien properly files an application for  adjustment of status as a dependent in accordance with this section,  including the evidence described in paragraphs (h) and (l) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Admissibility. The alien is not inadmissible to the United  States for permanent residence under any provisions of section 212(a) of  the Act, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relationship. The qualifying relationship to the principal alien  must have existed at the time the principal was granted adjustment of  status and must continue to exist at the time the dependent alien is  granted adjustment of status. To establish the qualifying relationship  to the principal alien, evidence must be submitted in accordance with  Sec. 204.2 of this chapter. Such evidence should consist of the  documents specified in Sec. 204.2(a)(1)(i)(B), (a)(1)(iii)(B), (a)(2),  (d)(2), and (d)(5) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Continuous physical presence. If the alien is applying as the  unmarried son or unmarried daughter of a principal HRIFA beneficiary, he  or she must have been physically present in the United States for a  continuous period beginning not later than December 31, 1995, and ending  on the date the application for adjustment is granted, as provided in  paragraphs (c)(4) and (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Applicability of grounds of inadmissibility contained in section  212(a)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain grounds of inadmissibility inapplicable to HRIFA  applicants. Paragraphs (4), (5), (6)(A), (7)(A) and (9)(B) of section  212(a) of the Act are inapplicable to HRIFA principal applicants and  their dependents. Accordingly, an applicant for adjustment of status  under section 902 of HRIFA need not establish admissibility under those  provisions in order to be able to adjust his or her status to that of  permanent resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Availability of individual waivers. If a HRIFA applicant is  inadmissible under any of the other provisions of section 212(a) of the  Act for which an immigrant waiver is available, the applicant may apply  for one or more of the immigrant waivers of inadmissibility under  section 212 of the Act, in accordance with Sec. 212.7 of this chapter.  In considering an application for waiver under section 212(g) of the Act  by an otherwise statutorily eligible applicant for adjustment of status  under HRIFA who was paroled into the United States from the U.S. Naval  Base at Guantanamo Bay, for the purpose of receiving   treatment of an HIV or AIDS condition, the fact that his or her arrival  in the United States was the direct result of a government decision to  provide such treatment should be viewed as a significant positive factor  when weighing discretionary factors. In considering an application for  waiver under section 212(i) of the Act by an otherwise statutorily  eligible applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA who used  counterfeit documents to travel from Haiti to the United States, the  adjudicator shall, when weighing discretionary factors, take into  consideration the general lawlessness and corruption which was  widespread in Haiti at the time of the alien's departure, the  difficulties in obtaining legitimate departure documents at that time,  and other factors unique to Haiti at that time which may have induced  the alien to commit fraud or make willful misrepresentations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for waiver of inadmissibility grounds for HRIFA  applicants under section 212(a)(9)(A) and 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act. An  applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA who is inadmissible under  section 212(a)(9)(A) or 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act, may apply for a waiver  of these grounds of inadmissibility while present in the United States.  Such an alien must file Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of  Excludability. If the application for adjustment is pending at the  Nebraska Service Center, Form I-601 must be filed with the director of  that office. If the application for adjustment is pending at a district  office, Form I-601 must be filed with the district director having  jurisdiction over the application. If the application for adjustment is  pending before the immigration court, Form I-601 must be filed with the  immigration judge having jurisdiction, or with the Board of Immigration  Appeals if the appeal is pending before the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Time for filing of applications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applications for HRIFA  benefits by a principal HRIFA applicant. The application period begins  on June 11, 1999. To benefit from the provisions of section 902 of  HRIFA, an alien who is applying for adjustment as a principal applicant  must properly file an application for adjustment of status before April  1, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applications by dependent aliens. The spouse, minor child, or  unmarried son or daughter of an alien who is eligible for adjustment of  status as a principal beneficiary under HRIFA may file an application  for adjustment of status under this section concurrently with or  subsequent to the filing of the application of the principal HRIFA  beneficiary. An application filed by a dependent may not be approved  prior to approval of the principal's application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this section. All applications filed with USCIS for the  benefits of section 902 of HRIFA must be submitted on the form  designated by USCIS with the fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and in  accordance with the form instructions. After proper filing of the  application, USCIS will instruct the applicant to appear for biometrics  collection as prescribed in 8 CFR 103.16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filing of applications by aliens in pending exclusion,  deportation, or removal proceedings. An alien who is in exclusion,  deportation, or removal proceedings pending before the Immigration Court  or the Board, or who has a pending motion to reopen or motion to  reconsider filed with the Immigration Court or the Board on or before  May 12, 1999, must apply for HRIFA benefits to the Immigration Court or  the Board, as provided in paragraph (p)(1) of this section, rather than  to the Service. However, an alien whose proceeding has been  administratively closed (see paragraph (p)(4) of this section) may only  apply for HRIFA benefits with the Service as provided in paragraph  (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing of applications with the Service by aliens who are  subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. An alien  who is subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal,  and who has not been denied adjustment of status under section 902   of HRIFA by the Immigration Court or the Board, may only apply for HRIFA  benefits with the Service as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this  section. This includes applications for HRIFA benefits filed by aliens  who have filed a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider a final order  after May 12, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien present in the United States who is subject to a final  order of exclusion, deportation, or removal and has been denied  adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA by the Immigration Court  or the Board, or who never applied for adjustment of status with the  Service, an Immigration Court, or the Board on or before March 31, 2000,  and who was made eligible for HRIFA benefits under the Legal Immigration  Family Equity Act of 2000 (LIFE Act) and LIFE amendments, Public Law  106-553 and Public Law 106-554, respectively, may file a motion to  reopen with either the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had  jurisdiction last. As provided by the LIFE Act, motions to reopen must  be filed on or before June 19, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stay of final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. The  filing of an application for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA with  the Service shall not stay the execution of such final order unless the  applicant has requested and been granted a stay in connection with the  HRIFA application. An alien who has filed a HRIFA application with the  Service may file an Application for Stay of Removal (Form I-246) in  accordance with section 241(c)(2) of the Act and Sec. 241.6 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Grant of stay. Absent evidence of the applicant's statutory  ineligibility for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA or  significant negative discretionary factors, a Form I-246 filed by a bona  fide applicant for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA shall be  approved and the removal of the applicant shall be stayed until such  time as the Service has adjudicated the application for adjustment in  accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Application and supporting documents. Each applicant for  adjustment of status must file an Application to Register Permanent  Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485). An applicant should complete  Part 2 of Form I-485 by checking box ``h--other'' and writing ``HRIFA-- Principal'' or ``HRIFA--Dependent'' next to that block. Each application  must be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fingerprinting fee. If the applicant is 14 years of age or  older, the fee for fingerprinting prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of  this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identifying information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A copy of the applicant's birth  certificate or other record of birth as provided in paragraph (m) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A completed Biographic Information Sheet (Form G-325A), if the  applicant is between 14 and 79 years of age;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A report of medical examination, as specified in Sec. 245.5  of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Two photographs, as described in the instructions to Form I- 485;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Arrival-Departure Record. A copy of the Form I-94 (see Sec.  1.4), Arrival-Departure Record, issued at the time of the applicant's  arrival in the United States, if the alien was inspected and admitted or  paroled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Police clearances. If the applicant is 14 years old or older, a  police clearance from each municipality where the alien has resided for  6 months or longer since arriving in the United States. If there are  multiple local law enforcement agencies (e.g., city police and county  sheriff) with jurisdiction over the alien's residence, the applicant may  obtain a clearance from either agency. If the applicant resides or  resided in a State where the State police maintain a compilation of all  local arrests and convictions, a statewide clearance is sufficient. If  the applicant presents a letter from the local police agencies involved,  or other evidence, to the effect that the applicant attempted to obtain  such clearance but was unable to do so because of local or State policy,  the director or immigration judge having jurisdiction over the  application may waive the local police clearance. Furthermore, if such  local police agency has provided the Service or the Immigration Court  with a blanket statement that issuance of such police clearance is  against local or State policy, the director or immigration judge having  jurisdiction over the case   may waive the local police clearance requirement regardless of whether  the applicant individually submits a letter from that local police  agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Proof of Haitian nationality. If the applicant acquired Haitian  nationality other than through birth in Haiti, a copy of the certificate  of naturalization or certificate of citizenship issued by the Haitian  government; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Additional supporting evidence.

An alien seeking HRIFA benefits as a principal  applicant, or as the unmarried son or daughter of a principal applicant,  must provide with the application evidence establishing continuity of  the alien's physical presence in the United States since December 31,  1995. (This requirement does not apply to a dependent seeking HRIFA  benefits as the spouse or minor child of a principal applicant.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evidence establishing presence. Evidence establishing the  continuity of the alien's physical presence in the United States since  December 31, 1995, may consist of any documentation issued by any  governmental or nongovernmental authority, provided such evidence bears  the name of the applicant, was dated at the time it was issued, and  bears the signature, seal, or other authenticating instrument of the  authorized representative of the issuing authority, if the document  would normally contain such authenticating instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.

If USCIS fails to adjudicate the application for  employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period,  or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment  authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for  interim employment authorization in accordance with Sec. 274a.13(d) of  this chapter.

Upon examination of the application,  including all other evidence submitted in support of the application,  all relevant Service records and all other relevant law enforcement  indices, the Director may approve the application without an interview  if the Director determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The alien's claim to eligibility for adjustment of status under  section 902 of HRIFA is verified through existing Service records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The alien is clearly eligible for adjustment of status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial without interview.

All applications for adjustment of status under  section 902 of HRIFA filed with an Immigration Court shall be subject to  the requirements of Sec. Sec. 3.11 and 3.31 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Motion to reopen or motion to reconsider.

Except as provided in  paragraph (d)(4) of this section, in the case of an alien who either has  a pending appeal with the Board or has a pending motion to reopen or  motion to reconsider timely filed with the Board on or before May 12,  1999, the Board shall remand, or reopen and remand, the proceedings to  the Immigration Court for the sole purpose of adjudicating an  application for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA, unless  the alien is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status under section  902 of HRIFA.

If the alien appears to be eligible to file an application for  adjustment of status under this section, the Immigration Court or the  Board (whichever has jurisdiction) shall, with the concurrence of the  Service, administratively close the proceedings or continue indefinitely  the motion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an otherwise-eligible alien whose exclusion,  deportation, or removal proceedings have been administratively closed  for reasons not specified in this section, the alien may only apply  before the Service for adjustment of status under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Approval of HRIFA applications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applications approved by the  Service. If the Service approves the application for adjustment of  status under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA, the director shall  record the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the  date of such approval and notify the applicant accordingly. The director  shall also advise the alien regarding the delivery of his or her  Permanent Resident Card and of the process for obtaining temporary  evidence of alien registration. If the alien had previously been issued  a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, such order shall be  deemed canceled as of the date of the director's approval of the  application for adjustment of status. If the alien had been in  exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings that were  administratively closed, such proceedings shall be deemed terminated as  of the date of approval of the application for adjustment of status by  the director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applications approved by an immigration judge or the Board. If  an immigration judge or (upon appeal) the Board grants an application  for adjustment under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA, the date of  the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence shall be the date  of such grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Review of decisions by the Service denying HRIFA applications-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Denial notification.

In the case of an alien who  is not maintaining valid nonimmigrant status and   who had not previously been placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal  proceedings, the director shall initiate removal proceedings in  accordance with Sec. 239.1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recalendaring or reinstatement of prior proceedings. In the  case of an alien whose previously initiated exclusion, deportation, or  removal proceeding had been administratively closed or continued  indefinitely under paragraph (p)(4) of this section, the director shall  make a request for recalendaring or reinstatement to the Immigration  Court that had administratively closed the proceeding, or the Board, as  appropriate, when the application has been denied. The Immigration Court  or the Board will then recalendar or reinstate the prior exclusion,  deportation, or removal proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Filing of renewed application. A principal alien may file a  renewed application for HRIFA benefits with the Immigration Court either  before or after March 31, 2000, if he or she had filed his or her  initial application for such benefits with the Service on or before  March 31, 2000.

The decision of an Immigration Court under paragraph (s)(1) of this  section denying an application for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA  for failure to appear may be rescinded or reopened only:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of  the denial if the alien demonstrates that the   failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in  section 240(e)(1) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien  demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in  person (or, if personal service was not practicable, through service by  mail to the alien or to the alien's counsel of record, if any) or the  alien demonstrates that he or she was in Federal or State custody and  the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon a motion to reopen filed not later than June 19, 2001, by  an alien present in the United States who became eligible for adjustment  of status under HRIFA, as amended by section 1505, of Public Law 106- 554.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Parole authorization for purposes of travel-- (1) Travel from  and return to the United States while the application for adjustment of  status is pending.

Unless the applicant files an advance parole  request prior to departing from the United States and USCIS approves  such request, his or her application for adjustment of status under  section 902 of HRIFA is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of  departure. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority  contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parole authorization for the purpose of filing an application  for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An otherwise  eligible applicant who is outside the United States and wishes to come  to the United States in order to apply for benefits under section 902 of  HRIFA may request parole authorization for such purpose by filing a  request on the form designated by USCIS with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR  103.7(b)(1) and in accordance with the form instructions.

If the alien files the  application for adjustment of status within that 60-day period, the  Service may re-parole the alien for such time as is necessary for  adjudication of the application. Failure to file such application for  adjustment of status within 60 days shall result in the alien being  returned to the custody of the Service and being examined as an arriving  alien applying for admission. Such examination will be conducted in  accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act if the  alien is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the  Act, or section 240 of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under any  other grounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority  contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the  Act.

The  execution of such final order shall not preclude   the applicant from filing an Application for Permission to Reapply for  Admission Into the United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I- 212) in accordance with Sec. 212.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Tolling the physical presence in the United States provision for  certain individuals--(1) Departure with advance authorization for  parole. In the case of an alien who departed the United States after  having been issued an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the  United States (Form I-512), and who returns to the United States in  accordance with the conditions of that document, the physical presence  in the United States requirement of section 902(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of HRIFA is tolled  while the alien is outside the United States pursuant to the issuance of  the Form I-512.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  of this section, and such application for parole authorization is  granted by the Service, the physical presence requirement contained in  section 902(b)(1) of HRIFA is tolled from the date the application is  received at the Nebraska Service Center until the alien is paroled into  the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form I-512.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Departure without advance authorization for parole.
