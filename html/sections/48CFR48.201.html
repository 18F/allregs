                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The contracting officer shall insert a value  engineering clause in solicitations and contracts when the contract  amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold,  except as specified in subparagraphs (1) through (5) and in paragraph  (f) below. A value engineering clause may be included in contracts of  lesser value if the contracting officer sees a potential for significant  savings. Unless the chief of the contracting office authorizes its  inclusion, the contracting officer shall not include a value engineering  clause in solicitations and contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For research and development other than full-scale development;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engineering services from not-for-profit or nonprofit  organizations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For personal services (see subpart 37.1);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Providing for product or component improvement, unless the value  engineering incentive application is restricted to areas not covered by  provisions for product or component improvement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For commercial products (see part 11) that do not involve  packaging specifications or other special requirements or  specifications; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the agency head has exempted the contract (or a class of  contracts) from the requirements of part 48.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Value engineering incentive. To provide a value engineering  incentive, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.248-1,  Value Engineering, in solicitations and contracts except as provided in  paragraph (a) above (but see subparagraph (e)(1) below).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Value engineering program requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a mandatory value  engineering effort is appropriate (i.e., if the contracting officer  considers that substantial savings to the Government may result from a  sustained value engineering effort of a specified level), the  contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I (but see  subparagraph (e)(2) below).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value engineering program requirement may be specified by  the Government in the solicitation or, in the case of negotiated  contracting, proposed by the contractor as part of its offer and  included as a subject for negotiation. The program requirement shall be  shown as a separately priced line item in the contract Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Value engineering incentive and program requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If both  a value engineering incentive and a mandatory program requirement are  appropriate, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its  Alternate II (but see subparagraph (e)(3) below).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract shall restrict the value engineering program  requirement to well-defined areas of performance designated by line item  in the contract Schedule. Alternate II applies a value engineering  program to the specified areas and a value engineering incentive to the  remaining areas of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Collateral savings computation not cost-effective. If the head  of the contracting activity determines for a contract or class of  contracts that the cost of computing and tracking collateral savings  will exceed the benefits to be derived, the contracting officer shall  use the clause with its--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alternate III if a value engineering incentive is involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternate III and Alternate I if a value engineering program  requirement is involved; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternate III and Alternate II if both an incentive and a  program requirement are involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Architect-engineering contracts. The contracting officer shall  insert the clause at 52.248-2, Value Engineering--Architect-Engineer, in  solicitations and contracts whenever the Government requires and pays  for a specific value engineering effort in architect-engineer contracts.  The clause at 52.248-1, Value Engineering, shall not be used in  solicitations and contracts for architect-engineer services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Engineering-development solicitations and contracts. For  engineering-development solicitations and contracts, and solicitations  and contracts containing low-rate-initial-production or early production  units, the contracting officer must modify the clause at 52.248-1, Value  Engineering, by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Revising paragraph (i)(3)(i) of the clause by substituting ``a  number equal to the quantity required to be delivered over a period of  between 36 and 60 consecutive months (set at the discretion of the  Contracting Officer for each VECP) that spans the highest planned  production, based on planning and programming or production  documentation at the time the VECP is accepted;'' for ``the number of  future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing  period;'' and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revising the first sentence under paragraph (3) of the  definition of ``acquisition savings'' by substituting ``a number equal  to the quantity to be delivered over a period of between 36 and 60  consecutive months (set at the discretion of the Contracting Officer for  each VECP) that spans the highest planned production, based on planning  and programming or production documentation at the time the VECP is  accepted.'' for ``the number of future contract units in the sharing  base.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Extended production period solicitations and contracts. In  solicitations and contracts for items requiring an extended period for  production (e.g., ship construction, major system acquisition), if  agency procedures prescribe sharing of future contract savings on all  units to be delivered under contracts awarded during the sharing period  (see 48.104-1(c)), the contracting officer must modify the clause at   52.248-1, Value Engineering, by revising paragraph (i)(3)(i) of the  clause and the first sentence under paragraph (3) of the definition of  ``acquisition savings'' by substituting ``under contracts awarded during  the sharing period'' for ``during the sharing period.''
