                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption. The FDIC may by agency order exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in Sec. 348.3 if the FDIC finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition and would not present safety and soundness concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presumptions. In reviewing an application for an exemption under this section, the FDIC will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if the depository organization seeking to add a management official:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primarily serves low-and moderate-income areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a minority group, or women;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is a depository institution that has been chartered for less than two years; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is deemed to be in ``troubled condition'' as defined in Sec. 303.101(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration. Unless a shorter expiration period is provided in the FDIC approval, an exemption permitted by paragraph (a) of this section may continue so long as it does not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, or is unsafe or unsound. If the FDIC grants an interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless otherwise provided by the FDIC in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures. Procedures for applying for an exemption under this section are set forth in 12 CFR 303.249.
