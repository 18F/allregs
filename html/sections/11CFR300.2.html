On or after November 6, 2002, an entity shall not be deemed to be directly or indirectly established, maintained, or controlled by another entity unless, based on the entities' actions and activities solely after November 6, 2002, they satisfy the requirements of this section. If an entity receives funds from another entity prior to November 6, 2002, and the recipient entity disposes of the funds prior to November 6, 2002, the receipt of such funds prior to November 6, 2002 shall have no bearing on determining whether the recipient entity is financed by the sponsoring entity within the meaning of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determinations by the Commission.

is not directly or indirectly financed, maintained, or controlled by the sponsor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the fact that a sponsor may have established an entity within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the sponsor or the entity may request an advisory opinion of the Commission determining that the relationship between the sponsor and the entity has been severed. The request for such an advisory opinion must meet the requirements of 11 CFR part 112, and must demonstrate that all material connections between the sponsor and the entity have been severed for two years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nothing in this section shall require entities that are separate organizations on November 6, 2002 to obtain an advisory opinion to operate separately from each other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disbursement.

For purposes of part 300, donation means a payment, gift, subscription, loan, advance, deposit, or anything of value given to a person, but does not include contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Federal account.

For the purposes of part 300, to solicit means to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation is an oral or written communication that, construed as reasonably understood in the context in which it is made, contains a clear message asking, requesting, or recommending that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation may be made directly or indirectly. The context includes the conduct of persons involved in the communication. A solicitation does not include mere statements of political support or mere guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following types of communications constitute solicitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A communication that provides a method of making a contribution or donation, regardless of the communication.

However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of ``to solicit'' merely because it includes a mailing address or phone number that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A communication that identifies a Web address where the Web page displayed is specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation, or automatically redirects

the Internet user to such a page, or exclusively displays a link to such a page. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of ``to solicit'' merely because it includes the address of a Web page that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following statements constitute solicitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Please give $100,000 to Group X.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``It is important for our State party to receive at least $100,000 from each of you in this election.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Group X has always helped me financially in my elections. Keep them in mind this fall.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ``X is an effective State party organization; it needs to obtain as many $100,000 donations as possible.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ``Giving $100,000 to Group X would be a very smart idea.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> ``Send all contributions to the following address * * *.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> ``I am not permitted to ask for contributions, but unsolicited contributions will be accepted at the following address * * *.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> ``Group X is having a fundraiser this week; you should go.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> ``You have reached the limit of what you may contribute directly to my campaign, but you can further help my campaign by assisting the State party.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A candidate hands a potential donor a list of people who have contributed to a group and the amounts of their contributions. The candidate says, ``I see you are not on the list.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> ``I will not forget those who contribute at this crucial stage.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> ``The candidate will be very pleased if we can count on you for $10,000.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> ``Your contribution to this campaign would mean a great deal to the entire party and to me personally.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Candidate says to potential donor: ``The money you will help us raise will allow us to communicate our message to the voters through Labor Day.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> ``I appreciate all you've done in the past for our party in this State. Looking ahead, we face some tough elections. I'd be very happy if you could maintain the same level of financial support for our State party this year.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> The head of Group X solicits a contribution from a potential donor in the presence of a candidate. The donor asks the candidate if the contribution to Group X would be a good idea and would help the candidate's campaign. The candidate nods affirmatively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following statements do not constitute solicitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During a policy speech, the candidate says: ``Thank you for your support of the Democratic Party.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: ``Thank you for your support of my campaign.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At a Labor Day rally, the candidate says: ``Thank you for your past financial support of the Republican Party.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At a GOTV rally, the candidate says: ``Thank you for your continuing support.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: ``It is critical that we support the entire Democratic ticket in November.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A Federal officeholder says: ``Our Senator has done a great job for us this year. The policies she has vigorously promoted in the Senate have really helped the economy of the State.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A candidate says: ``Thanks to your contributions we have been able to support our President, Senator and Representative during the past election cycle.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> To direct. For the purposes of part 300, to direct means to guide, directly or indirectly, a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value, by identifying a candidate, political committee or organization, for the receipt of such funds, or things of value. The contribution, donation, transfer, or thing of value may be made or provided directly or through a conduit or intermediary. Direction does not include merely providing information or guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Individual holding Federal office. Individual holding Federal office means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator

or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.
