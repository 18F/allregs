                                Sec.  141.855  Routine monitoring requirements for community water
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) The provisions of this section apply to community water systems using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2) and serving 1,000 or fewer people.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section apply to community water systems using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2) and serving 1,000 or fewer people.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in Sec.  141.858.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once all monitoring required by this section and Sec.  141.858 for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in Sec.  141.859 have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by Sec.  141.859.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. The monitoring frequency for total coliforms is one sample/month, except as provided for under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transition to subpart Y. (1) All systems must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under Sec.  141.21 that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions in paragraph (e) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All systems must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under Sec.  141.21 that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions in paragraph (e) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning April 1, 2016, the State must perform a special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the State has performed the special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the State may modify the system's monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule, consistent with the provisions of this section. The State may not allow systems to begin less frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for reduced monitoring. (1) The State may reduce the monitoring frequency from monthly monitoring to no less than quarterly monitoring if the system is in compliance with State-certified operator provisions and demonstrates that it meets the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii) of this section. A system that loses its certified operator must return to monthly monitoring the month following that loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State may reduce the monitoring frequency from monthly monitoring to no less than quarterly monitoring if the system is in compliance with State-certified operator provisions and demonstrates that it meets the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii) of this section. A system that loses its certified operator must return to monthly monitoring the month following that loss.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The most recent sanitary survey shows the system is free of sanitary defects (or has an approved plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and the schedule), has a protected water source and

meets approved construction standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The system meets at least one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An annual site visit by the State that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment or an annual Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State and correction of all identified sanitary defects (or an approved plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and schedule).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Cross connection control, as approved by the State.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria specified by the State.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as provided for under Sec.  141.403(b)(3).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Return to routine monthly monitoring requirements. Systems on quarterly monitoring that experience any of the events in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. The system must continue monthly monitoring until it meets the reduced monitoring requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system has an E. coli MCL violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The system has two subpart Y monitoring violations in a rolling 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample. Systems collecting samples on a quarterly frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month, except that the State may waive this requirement if the conditions of paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section are met. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The State cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary surveys.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the State must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA and the public. The written documentation must describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. If the State determines that the

system has corrected the contamination problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in Sec.  141.858, and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative, the State may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring the next month.</p>
