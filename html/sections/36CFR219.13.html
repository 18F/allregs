                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Plan amendment. A plan may be amended at any time. Plan amendments may be broad or narrow, depending on the need for change, and should be used to keep plans current and help units adapt to new information or changing conditions. The responsible official has the discretion to determine whether and how to amend the plan. Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, a plan amendment is required to add, modify, or remove one or more plan components, or to change how or where one or more plan components apply to all or part of the plan

area (including management areas or geographic areas).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendment process. The responsible official shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Base an amendment on a preliminary identification of the need to change the plan. The preliminary identification of the need to change the plan may be based on a new assessment; a monitoring report; or other documentation of new information, changed conditions, or changed circumstances. When a plan amendment is made together with, and only applies to, a project or activity decision, the analysis prepared for the project or activity may serve as the documentation for the preliminary identification of the need to change the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide opportunities for public participation as required in Sec. 219.4 and public notification as required in Sec. 219.16. The responsible official may combine processes and associated public notifications where appropriate, considering the scope and scale of the need to change the plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amend the plan consistent with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects. A proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus require preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative changes. An administrative change is any change to a plan that is not a plan amendment or plan revision. Administrative changes include corrections of clerical errors to any part of the plan, conformance of the plan to new statutory or regulatory requirements, or changes to other content in the plan (Sec. 219.7(f)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A substantive change to the monitoring program made outside of the process for plan revision or amendment may be made only after notice to the public of the intended change and consideration of public comment (Sec. 219.16(c)(6)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All other administrative changes may be made following public notice (Sec. 219.16(c)(6)).</p>
