                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In a Treaty between the United States and Canada proclaimed on  August 11, 1934, the respective Governments were satisfied of the  sheltered nature of certain waters of the west coast of North America.  It was agreed to exempt vessels of the United States and Canadian  vessels from load line requirements when such vessels engage on  international voyages originating on, wholly confined to, and  terminating on such waters. In Article I of this Treaty these waters are  described as follows: ``* * * the waters of Puget Sound, the waters  lying between Vancouver Island and the mainland, and east of a line from  a point 1 nautical mile west of the city limits of Port Angeles in the  State of Washington to Race Rocks on Vancouver Island, and of a line  from Hope Island, British Columbia, to Cape Calvert, Calvert Island,  British Columbia, the waters east of a line from Cape Calvert to Duke  Point on Duke Island, and the waters north of Duke Island and east of  Prince of Wales Island, Baranof Island, and Chicagof Island, the waters  of Peril, Neva, and Olga Straits to Sitka, and the waters east of a line  from Port Althorp of Chicagof Island to Cape Spencer, Alaska, are  sheltered waters * * *.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S.-flag vessels and Canadian vessels navigating on the treaty  waters on a voyage as described in paragraph (a) of this section are by  virtue of this Treaty of August 11, 1934, not subject to load line  requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and the  regulations in this subchapter. Vessels navigating these sheltered  waters and passing outside their boundary on any voyage cannot claim the  benefits of this Treaty and shall be in compliance with the applicable  load line requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and  the regulations in this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Since subdivision requirements apply to all passenger vessels  subject to the 1960 International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea,  those passenger vessels navigating on the waters described in paragraph  (a) of this section shall be in compliance with such 1960 Convention  requirements and the regulations in part 46 of this subchapter. The  Coast Guard issues to such a vessel a stability letter. The assigning  authority is authorized to issue to such a passenger vessel an  appropriate load line certificate, modified to meet the conditions  governing her service assignment, and marking.
