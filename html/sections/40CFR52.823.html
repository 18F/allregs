                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Iowa Department of Natural Resources committed to comply with  the PM10 regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a  letter to Morris Kay, EPA, dated October 28, 1988, Mr. Larry J. Wilson,  Director, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, stated:</p><p class="depth0">Three groups within the State of Iowa have been classified as Group  II areas for fine particulate (PM-10) State Implementation Plan (SIP)  development purposes. This includes portions of the cities of Des  Moines, Mason   City, and Cedar Rapids. The specific boundaries of these areas were  identified in a letter of October 13, 1987, from Peter R. Hamlin to Carl  Walter. The remainder of the State was classified as Group III.</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with the SIP development procedures identified in the  preamble of the PM-10 regulations for Implementing Revised Particulate  Matter Standards, promulgated July 1, 1987, the State of Iowa commits to  perform the following activities in these three Group II areas of the  state:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gather ambient PM-10 data, to an extent consistent with minimum  EPA requirements (note the network description contained in a letter of  January 26, 1988, from Peter R. Hamlin to John Helvig).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Analyze and verify the ambient PM-10 data and report exceedances  of the 24-hour PM-10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to  the Regional Office within 60 days of each exceedance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediately notify the Regional Office:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the availability of an appropriate number of verifiable 24- hour NAAQS exceedances to indicate a violation (see Section 2.0 of the  PM-10 SIP development guideline) or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> when an annual arithmetic mean (AAM) above the annual PM-10  NAAQS becomes available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within thirty (30) days of any notification of the Regional  Office pursuant to (c) above (or upon collection of thirty-six (36)  months of PM-10 ambient air quality data acceptable to EPA, whichever  comes first) determine whether the measures in the existing SIP will  assure timely attainment and maintenance of the primary PM-10 NAAQS and  immediately notify the Regional Office of the results of this  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within six (6) months of any notification pursuant to (d) above,  adopt and submit to EPA a PM-10 control strategy that assures attainment  as expeditiously as practicable but not later than three (3) years from  approval of the Committal SIP.</p><p class="depth2">Because of the uncertainty about when the determination can be made  pursuant to (d) above, it is difficult to determine if that control  strategy could provide for the attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS within  three years from the date EPA approves this Committal SIP. Therefore, I  reserve the right to request a two-year extension of the attainment date  as provided in Section 110(e) of the Clean Air Act, if and when the  State of Iowa submits a SIP revision for any of these areas of the  state.</p><p class="depth2">The State of Iowa also commits to develop a PM-10 emission inventory  for the areas submitted as part of any PM-10 SIP pursuant to items (c),  (d), and (e) above. If the PM-10 NAAQS are not violated, the State of  Iowa will proceed with this inventory for the three Group II areas in  accordance with the following schedule:  October 1, 1988--Request special assistance funds from EPA to perform  the inventory. October 1, 1989--Initiate inventory. August 1, 1990--Complete inventory. October 31, 1990 *--Submit inventory as part of a determination of  adequacy that the current SIP will attain and maintain the PM-10 NAAQS. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">* Presuming that sufficient ambient data acceptable to EPA are  collected by July 31, 1990, and available by September 30, 1990.  [54 FR 33539, Aug. 15, 1989]</p>
