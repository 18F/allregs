                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If an employer partially withdraws from the same  multiemployer plan on two or more occasions during the same plan year,  the rules of Sec. 4208.4 shall be applied as modified by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> or (c)(2) or under paragraph (c) of this section. The  employer may qualify for abatement under Sec. 4208.4(a) and (c)(1) and  under any rules adopted by the plan pursuant to Sec. 4208.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Resumption of work at all facilities and under all bargaining  agreements. The test under this paragraph is satisfied if for each of  the two consecutive plan years referred to in Sec. 4208.4(b), the  employer's total contribution base units for the facilities and under  the collective bargaining agreements with respect to which the employer  incurred the multiple partial withdrawals exceed 30 percent of the total  number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had  an obligation to contribute for those facilities and under those  agreements for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this  section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With respect to a resumption of work under Sec. 4208.4(b)(1),  the condition under this paragraph is satisfied if, for the two  consecutive plan years referred to in Sec. 4208.4(b)(1), the employer's  contribution base units for any reentered facility or agreement exceed  30 percent of the number of contribution base units with respect to  which the employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or  under that agreement for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of  this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to a resumption of work under Sec. 4208.4(b)(2),  the condition under this paragraph is satisfied if, for the two  consecutive plan years referred to in Sec. 4208.4(b)(2), the employer's  contribution base units for any reentered facility or agreement exceed  90 percent of the number of contribution base units with respect to  which the employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or  under that agreement for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of  this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer's reduced withdrawal liability and, if any, the  reduced annual payments of the liability shall be determined by adding  the average number of contribution base units that the employer is  required to contribute for those two consecutive years for that  facility(ies) or agreement(s) to the numerator of the fraction described  in section 4206(a)(2)(A) of ERISA. The amount of any remaining partial  withdrawal liability shall be paid over the schedule originally  established starting with the first payment due after the revised  payment schedule is issued under Sec. 4208.3(c)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Base year. For purposes of this section, the base year  contribution base units for a reentered facility(ies) or under a  reentered agreement(s) are the average number of contribution base units  for the facility(ies) or under the agreement(s) for the two plan years  for which the employer's contribution base units for that facility(ies)  or under that agreement(s) were highest within the five plan years  immediately preceding the partial withdrawal.</p>
