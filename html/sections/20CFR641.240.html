In order to enhance skill development  related to the IEP, it may be necessary to provide training beyond the  community service assignment to enable participants to meet their  unsubsidized employment objectives. The SCSEP grantee or sub-recipient,  the host agency, the WIA program, or another One-Stop partner may  provide training as appropriate and as negotiated in the MOU.
