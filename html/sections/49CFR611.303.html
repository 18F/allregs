This policy guidance, which is subject to a public comment period, is issued periodically by FTA whenever significant changes are proposed, but not less frequently than every two years, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measures will be applied to projects defined by project sponsors that are proposed to FTA for Small Starts funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ratings for each of the criteria in Sec. 611.303(b)(1) through (6) will be expressed in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``medium-low,'' or ``low.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The project justification criteria are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cost-effectiveness, as measured by cost per rider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Economic development effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Existing land use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mobility improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Environmental benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Congestion relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In evaluating proposed Small Starts projects under these criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As a candidate project proceeds through project development, a greater level of commitment will be expected with respect to transit supportive land use plans and policies and the project sponsor's technical capacity to implement the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any criteria under paragraph (b) of this section that use incremental measures, the point for comparison will be the no-build alternative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FTA may amend the measures for these project justification criteria. Any such amendment will be included in policy guidance and subject to a public comment process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> From time to time FTA may publish through policy guidance standards based on characteristics of projects and/or corridors to be served. If a proposed project can meet the established standards, FTA may assign an automatic rating on one or more of the project justification criteria outlined in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The individual ratings for each of the criteria described in this section will be combined into a summary project justification rating of ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``medium-low,'' or ``low'' through a process that gives comparable, but not necessarily equal, weight to each criterion. The

process by which the project justification rating will be developed, including the assigned weights, will be described in policy guidance.</p>
