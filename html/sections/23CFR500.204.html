                                Sec. 500.204  TMS components for highway traffic data.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each State's TMS, including those using alternative  procedures, shall address the components in paragraphs (b) through (h)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Precision of reported data. Traffic data supplied for the  purposes identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart shall be to the  statistical precision applicable at the time of the data's collection as  specified by the data users at various levels of government. A State's  TMS shall meet the statistical precisions established by FHWA for the  HPMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuous counter operations. Within each State, there shall be  sufficient continuous counters of traffic volumes, vehicle  classification, and vehicle weight to provide estimates of changes in  highway travel patterns and to provide for the development of day-of- week, seasonal, axle correction, growth factors, or other comparable  factors approved by the FHWA that support the development of traffic  estimates to meet the statistical precision requirements of the data  uses identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart. As appropriate,  sufficient continuous   counts of vehicle classification and vehicle weight should be available  to address traffic data program needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Short term traffic monitoring. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Count data for traffic  volumes collected in the field shall be adjusted to reflect annual  average conditions. The estimation of annual average daily traffic will  be through the appropriate application of only the following: Seasonal  factors, day-of-week factors, and, when necessary, axle correction and  growth factors or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. Count  data that have not been adjusted to represent annual average conditions  will be noted as being unadjusted when they are reported. The duration  and frequency of such monitoring shall comply to the data needs  identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle classification activities on the National Highway System  (NHS), shall be sufficient to assure that, on a cycle of no greater than  three years, every major system segment (i.e., segments between  interchanges or intersections of principal arterials of the NHS with  other principal arterials of the NHS) will be monitored to provide  information on the numbers of single-trailer combination trucks,  multiple-trailer combination trucks, two-axle four-tire vehicles, buses  and the total number of vehicles operating on an average day. If it is  determined that two or more continuous major system segments have both  similar traffic volumes and distributions of the vehicle types  identified above, a single monitoring session will be sufficient to  monitor these segments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vehicle occupancy monitoring. As deemed appropriate to support  the data uses identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart, data will  be collected on the average number of persons per automobile, light two- axle truck, and bus. The duration, geographic extent, and level of  detail shall be consistent with the intended use of the data, as  cooperatively agreed to by the organizations that will use the data and  the organizations that will collect the data. Such vehicle occupancy  data shall be reviewed at least every three years and updated as  necessary. Acceptable data collection methods include roadside  monitoring, traveler surveys, the use of administrative records (e.g.,  accident reports or reports developed in support of public  transportation programs), or any other method mutually acceptable to the  responsible organizations and the FHWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Field operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each State's TMS for highway traffic data  shall include the testing of equipment used in the collection of the  data. This testing shall be based on documented procedures developed by  the State. This documentation will describe the test procedure as well  as the frequency of testing. Standards of the American Society for  Testing and Materials or guidance from the AASHTO may be used. Only  equipment passing the test procedures will be used for the collection of  data for the purposes identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation of field operations shall include the number of  counts, the period of monitoring, the cycle of monitoring, and the  spatial and temporal distribution of count sites. Copies of the State's  documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when  it is initially developed and after each revision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Source data retention. For estimates of traffic or travel, the  value or values collected during a monitoring session, as well as  information on the date(s) and hour(s) of monitoring, will remain  available until the traffic or travel estimates based on the count  session are updated. Data shall be available in formats that conform to  those in the version of the TMG current at the time of data collection  or as then amended by the FHWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Office factoring procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factors to adjust data from  short term monitoring sessions to estimates of average daily conditions  shall be used to adjust for month, day of week, axle correction, and  growth or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. These factors  will be reviewed annually and updated at least every three years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures used by a State to edit and adjust highway  traffic data collected from short term counts at field locations to  estimates of average traffic volume shall be documented. The  documentation shall include the factors discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section. The documentation shall remain available as long as the  traffic   or travel estimates discussed in paragraph (g) of this section remain  current. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the  FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after  each revision.</p>
