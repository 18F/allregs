If the unintentional radiator contains a digital device, the upper frequency to be investigated shall be that shown in the table below or in the table in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as based on both the highest frequency generated and the highest frequency used in the digital device, whichever range is higher.

device, the frequency range shall be investigated up to the higher of the second harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the device or the upper frequency of the measurement range specified for the digital device in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The above specified frequency ranges of measurements apply to the measurement of radiated emissions and, in the case of receivers, the measurement to demonstrate compliance with the antenna conduction limits specified in Sec. 15.111. The frequency range of measurements for AC power line conducted limits is specified in Secs. 15.107 and 15.207 and applies to all equipment subject to those regulations. In some cases, depending on the frequency(ies) generated and used by the equipment, only signals conducted onto the AC power lines are required to be measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and subharmonics of the fundamental frequency as well as to those frequencies removed from the fundamental by multiples of the oscillator frequency. Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier states should also be checked.
