                            <p class="depth0">An administrative law judge designated by the chief administrative law judge, by the associate chief judge in San Francisco, California, by the associate chief judge in New York, New York, or by the associate chief judge in Atlanta, Georgia, as the case may be, shall rule on all prehearing motions (except as provided in Sec. Sec. 102.16, 102.22, 102.29, and 102.50), and all such rulings and orders shall be issued in writing and a copy served on each of the parties. The administrative law judge designated to conduct the hearing shall rule on all motions after opening of the hearing (except as provided in Sec. 102.47), and any orders in connection therewith, if announced at the hearing, shall be stated orally on the record; in all other cases the administrative law judge shall issue such rulings and orders in writing and shall cause a copy of the same to be served on each of the parties, or shall make his ruling in his decision. Whenever the administrative law judge has reserved his ruling on any motion, and the proceeding is thereafter transferred to and continued before the Board pursuant to Sec. 102.50, the Board shall rule on such motion.
