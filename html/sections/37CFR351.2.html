                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commencement; duration. After the date for filing petitions to  participate in a proceeding, the Copyright Royalty Judges will announce  the beginning of a voluntary negotiation period and will make a list of  the participants available to the participants in the particular  proceeding. The voluntary negotiation period shall last three months,  after which the parties shall notify the Copyright Royalty Judges in  writing as to whether a settlement has been reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distribution proceedings. Pursuant to 17 U.S.C.  801(b)(7)(A), to the extent that a settlement has been reached in a  distribution proceeding, that agreement will provide the basis for the  distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Royalty rate proceedings. If, in a proceeding to determine  statutory terms and rates, the participating parties report that a  settlement has been reached by some or all of the parties, the Copyright  Royalty Judges, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 801(b)(7)(A), will publish the  settlement in the Federal Register for notice and comment from those  bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set by the agreement.  If an objection to the adoption of an agreement is filed, the Copyright  Royalty Judges may decline to adopt the agreement as a basis for  statutory terms and rates for participants that are not parties to the  agreement if the   Copyright Royalty Judges conclude that the agreement does not provide a  reasonable basis for setting statutory terms or rates.
