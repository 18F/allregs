                            <p class="depth0">Prior to submitting an application, each applicant must notify the applicable FAA Regional Frequency Management Office. Each application must be accompanied by a statement showing the name of the FAA Regional Office and date notified. The Commission will assign the frequency. Normally, frequencies available for air traffic control operations set forth in subpart E will be assigned to an AWOS, ASOS, or to an ATIS. When a licensee has entered into an agreement with the FAA to operate the same station as both an AWOS and as an ATIS, or as an ASOS and an ATIS, the same frequency will be used in both modes of operation.
