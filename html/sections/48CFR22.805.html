                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preaward clearances for contracts and subcontracts of $10  million or more (excluding construction). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(8) of this section, if the estimated amount of  the contract or subcontract is $10 million or more, the contracting  officer shall request clearance from the appropriate OFCCP regional  office before--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Award of any contract, including any indefinite delivery  contract or letter contract; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Modification of an existing contract for new effort that would  constitute a contract award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preaward clearance for each proposed contract and for each  proposed first-tier subcontract of $10 million or more shall be  requested by the contracting officer directly from the OFCCP regional  office(s). Verbal requests shall be confirmed by letter or facsimile  transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the contract work is to be performed outside the United  States with employees recruited within the United States, the  contracting officer shall send the request for a preaward clearance to  the OFCCP regional office serving the area where the proposed  contractor's corporate home or branch office is located in the United  States, or the corporate location where personnel recruiting is handled,  if different from the contractor's corporate home or branch office. If  the proposed contractor has no corporate office or location within the  United States, the preaward clearance request action should be based on  the location of the recruiting and training agency in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contracting officer does not need to request a preaward  clearance if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific proposed contractor is listed in OFCCP's National  Preaward Registry via the Internet at http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward/;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The projected award date is within 24 months of the proposed  contractor's Notice of Compliance completion date in the Registry; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contracting officer documents the Registry review in the  contract file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The contracting officer shall include the following information  in the preaward clearance request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the prospective  contractor and of any corporate affiliate at which work is to be  performed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of each proposed first-tier  subcontractor with a proposed subcontract estimated at $10 million or  more.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Anticipated date of award.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information as to whether the contractor and first-tier  subcontractors have previously held any Government contracts or  subcontracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Place or places of performance of the prime contract and first- tier subcontracts estimated at $10 million or more, if known.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The estimated dollar amount of the contract and each first-tier  subcontract, if known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The contracting officer shall allow as much time as feasible  before award for the conduct of necessary compliance evaluation by  OFCCP. As soon as the apparently successful offeror can be determined,  the contracting officer shall process a preaward clearance request in  accordance with agency procedures, assuring, if possible, that   the preaward clearance request is submitted to the OFCCP regional office  at least 30 days before the proposed award date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Within 15 days of the clearance request, OFCCP will inform the  awarding agency of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance  evaluation. If OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that  period of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation,  clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to  proceed with the award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its  intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, OFCCP shall be  allowed an additional 20 days after the date that it so informs the  awarding agency to provide its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide  the awarding agency with its conclusions within that period, clearance  shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with  the award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of  this section would delay award of an urgent and critical contract beyond  the time necessary to make award or beyond the time specified in the  offer or extension thereof, the contracting officer shall immediately  inform the OFCCP regional office of the expiration date of the offer or  the required date of award and request clearance be provided before that  date. If the OFCCP regional office advises that a preaward evaluation  cannot be completed by the required date, the contracting officer shall  submit written justification for the award to the head of the  contracting activity, who, after informing the OFCCP regional office,  may then approve the award without the preaward clearance. If an award  is made under this authority, the contracting officer shall immediately  request a postaward evaluation from the OFCCP regional office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If, under the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a  postaward evaluation determines the contractor to be in noncompliance  with E.O. 11246, the Deputy Assistant Secretary may authorize the use of  the enforcement procedures at 22.809 against the noncomplying  contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Furnishing posters. The contracting officer shall furnish to the  contractor appropriate quantities of the poster entitled Equal  Employment Opportunity Is The Law. These shall be obtained in accordance  with agency procedures.  [48 FR 42258, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 63 FR 70284, Dec. 18, 1998]</p>
