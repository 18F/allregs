In the case of a disposition as part of a separation or  divorce settlement, the disposition will not be considered to be for  less than fair market value if the applicant or tenant receives  important consideration not measurable in dollar terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of determining annual income under Sec. 5.609, the  term ``net family assets'' does not include the value of a home  currently being purchased with assistance under part 982, subpart M of  this title.
