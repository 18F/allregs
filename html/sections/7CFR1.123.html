adequate advance notice is provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of such action on the privacy and other personal or property rights of individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the constitutional principles of federalism and separation of powers.
