                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the General Provisions (40 CFR part 60, subpart A). In  addition, the average values of the monitored parameters measured at  least every 15 minutes and averaged over the period of the performance  test shall be submitted with the results of all performance tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> in the first calendar year of operation shall submit to the  Administrator, with the notification of projected startup, a material  flow chart indicating projected solvent use. The owner or operator shall  also submit actual solvent use records at the end of the initial  calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation  initially utilizing less than the applicable volume of solvent specified  in Sec. 60.710(b) per calendar year shall report the first calendar  year in which actual annual solvent use exceeds the applicable volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, or  affected   coating mix preparation equipment subject to Sec. 60.712(c), shall  submit semiannual reports to the Administrator documenting the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (liquid material balance);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The VOC contained in the coatings for the manufacture of  magnetic tape for any 1-month period during which the weighted average  solvent content (G) of the coatings exceeded 0.20 kilogram per liter of  coating solids for those affected facilities complying with Sec.  60.712(e) (high-solids coatings alternative standard);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for  all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive  adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which  the average value of the concentration level of organic compounds in the  common outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the  average value measured during the most recent performance test that  demonstrated compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks  for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber  vessel when the concentration level of organic compounds in the  individual outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the  average value for that adsorber vessel measured during the most recent  performance test that demonstrated compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for  all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive  adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which  the average carbon adsorption system efficiency falls below the  applicable level as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the  performance test method described in Sec. 60.713(b)(2) or (4), the  value of E determined using Equation (2) during the most recent  performance test that demonstrated compliance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant  to Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(A) or Sec. 60.713(b)(6), 0.95 (95 percent).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant  to Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(B), the required value of E determined using  Equation (2) pursuant to Sec. 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or  reconstruction or 0.95 (95 percent), whichever is lower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks  for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber  vessel when the efficiency falls below the applicable level as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the  performance test method described in Sec. 60.713(b)(3) or (4), the  value of Hv determined using Equation (4) during the most  recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant  to Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(A) or Sec. 60.713(b)(6), 0.95 (95 percent).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant  to Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(B), the value of Hv determined  using Equation 4 pursuant to Sec. 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or  reconstruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during  which the average exhaust temperature is 5 or more Celsius degrees above  the average temperature measured during the most recent performance test  that demonstrated compliance for those affected facilities monitoring  condenser exhaust gas temperature;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during  which the average combustion temperature is more than 28 Celsius degrees  below the average combustion temperature during the most recent  performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected  facilities monitoring thermal incinerator combustion gas temperature;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during  which the average gas temperature immediately before the catalyst bed is  more than 28 Celsius degrees below the average gas temperature during  the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance and all 3- hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average  gas temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80  percent of the average gas temperature difference during the most recent  performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected  facilities monitoring catalytic incinerator catalyst bed temperature;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during  which the average total enclosure or VOC capture system monitoring  device readings vary by 5 percent or more from the average value  measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated  compliance for those affected facilities monitoring a total enclosure  pursuant to Sec. 60.714(h) or VOC capture system pursuant to Sec.  60.714(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, or  affected coating mix preparation equipment subject to Sec. 60.712(c),  not required to submit reports under Sec. 60.717(d) because no  reportable periods have occurred shall submit semiannual reports so  affirming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation  equipment that is constructed at a time when no affected coating  operation is being constructed shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (2), and (4); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit the notification of actual startup specified in Sec.  60.7(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation  equipment that is constructed at the same time as an affected coating  operation shall include the affected coating mix preparation equipment  in all the reporting requirements for the affected coating operation  specified in Sec. 60.7(a)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The reports required under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this  section shall be postmarked within 30 days of the end of the reporting  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of this subsection remain in force until and  unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section  111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative  means of compliance surveillance adopted by such States. In this event,  affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to  comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the  requirements established by the State.
