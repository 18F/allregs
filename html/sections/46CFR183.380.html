                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overcurrent protection must be provided for each ungrounded  conductor for the purpose of opening the electric circuit if the current  reaches a value that causes an excessive or dangerous temperature in the  conductor or conductor insulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grounded conductor of a circuit must not be disconnected by  a switch or circuit breaker, unless the ungrounded conductors are  simultaneously disconnected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A conductor of a control, interlock, or indicator circuit, such  as a conductor for an instrument, pilot light, ground detector light, or  potential transformer, must be protected by an overcurrent device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conductors must be protected in accordance with their current  carrying capacities. If the allowable current carrying capacity does not  correspond to a standard device size, the next larger overcurrent device  may be used provided it does not exceed 150 percent of the conductor  current carrying capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Steering gear control system circuits must be protected against  short circuit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each steering gear feeder circuit must be protected by a circuit  breaker that meets the requirements of Sec. 58.25-55 in subchapter F of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each lighting branch circuit must be protected against  overcurrent either by fuses or circuit breakers rated at not more than  30 amperes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Overcurrent devices capable of carrying the starting current of  the motor must be installed to protect motors, motor conductors, and  control apparatus against:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Overcurrent due to short circuits or ground faults; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overload due to motor running overcurrent, in accordance with  Sec. 111.70-1 in subchapter J of this chapter. A protective device  integral with the motor, which is responsive to both motor current and  temperature, may be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An emergency switch must be provided in the normally ungrounded  main supply conductor from a battery. The switch must be accessible and  located as close to the battery as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Disconnect means must be provided on the supply side of and  adjacent to all fuses for the purpose of de-energizing the fuses for  inspection and maintenance purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If the disconnect means is not within sight of the equipment  that the circuit supplies, means must be provided for locking the  disconnect device in the open position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Fuses must be of the cartridge type only and be listed by  Underwriters Laboratories or another independent laboratory recognized  by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Each circuit breaker must meet UL 489 (incorporated by  reference; see 46 CFR 175.600) or other standard specified by the  Commandant, and be of the manually reset type designed for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inverse time delay;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instantaneous short circuit protection; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Switching duty if the breaker is used as a switch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Each circuit breaker must indicate whether it is in the open or  closed position.
