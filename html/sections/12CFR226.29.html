                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Any State may apply to the Board to exempt a class of transactions within the State from the requirements of chapter 2 (Credit transactions) or chapter 4 (Credit billing) of the Act and the corresponding provisions of this regulation. The Board shall grant an exemption if it determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State law is substantially similar to the Federal law or, in the case of chapter 4, affords the consumer

greater protection than the Federal law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is adequate provision for enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Civil liability. (1) No exemptions granted under this section shall extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130 and 131 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No exemptions granted under this section shall extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130 and 131 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an exemption has been granted, the disclosures required by the applicable State law (except any additional requirements not imposed by Federal law) shall constitute the disclosures required by this Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications. The procedures under which a State may apply for an exemption under this section are set forth in appendix B.
