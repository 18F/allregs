                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing document under seal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may file any  document or any part of a document under seal and/or seek a protective  order concerning any document if disclosure of the document would be  inconsistent with the protection of the public interest or if justice  requires protection of any person, including a source or a party, from  annoyance, threat, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or the  disclosure of the information would be, or might reasonably lead to a  disclosure, contrary to Executive Order 12958, as amended by Executive  Order 13292, or other Executive orders concerning disclosure of  information, Department regulations, or the Privacy Act, or information  exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act. The  Administrative Law Judge shall allow placement of any such document  under seal and/or grant a protective order upon a showing that the  disclosure would be inconsistent with any such statute or Executive  order, or that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the  benefits of disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A respondent may file any document or any part of a document  under seal and/or seek a protective order to limit such document from  disclosure to other parties or to the public. The Administrative Law  Judge shall allow placement of any document under seal and/or grant a  protective order upon a   showing that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the  benefits of disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrative Law Judge shall safeguard the security and  integrity of any documents under seal or protective order and shall take  all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such documents  or any parts thereof, including closing a hearing or portions of a  hearing to the public. Release of any information under seal or to the  extent inconsistent with a protective order, in any form or manner, is  subject to the sanctions and the exercise of the authorities as are  provided with respect to ex parte communications under Sec. 501.719.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrative Law Judge denies placement of any document  under seal or under protective order, any party, and any person whose  document or material is at issue, may obtain interlocutory review by the  Secretary's designee. In such cases the Administrative Law Judge shall  not release or expose any of the records or documents in question to the  public or to any person for a period of 20 days from the date of the  Administrative Law Judge's ruling, in order to permit a party the  opportunity either to withdraw the records and documents or obtain  interlocutory review by the Secretary's designee and an order that the  records be placed under seal or a protective order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon settlement, final decision, or motion to the Administrative  Law Judge for good cause shown, all materials (including all copies)  under seal or protective order shall be returned to the submitting  parties, except when it may be necessary to retain a record until any  judicial process is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written notice of each request for release of documents or  materials under seal or subject to a protective order shall be given to  the parties at least 20 days prior to any permitted release or prior to  any access not specifically authorized under a protective order. A copy  of each request for information, including the name, address, and  telephone number of the requester, shall be provided to the parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each request for access to protected material shall include the  names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons on whose behalf  the requester seeks access to protected information. The Administrative  Law Judge may impose sanctions as provided under Sec. 501.729 for  failure to provide this information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. An application for a protective order or to place  under seal shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. The  application shall be accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to  which confidential treatment is sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure for supplying additional information. The person  making the application may be required to furnish in writing additional  information with respect to the grounds for objection to public  disclosure. Failure to supply the information so requested within 14  days from the date of receipt of a notice of the information required  shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that  portion of the information to which the additional information relates,  unless the Administrative Law Judge shall otherwise order for good cause  shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confidentiality of materials pending final decision. Pending the  determination of the application for confidential treatment,  transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and  other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under  seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the Administrative Law  Judge, the Secretary's designee, the applicant, the Director, and any  other respondent and representative; and shall be made available to the  public only in accordance with orders of the Administrative Law Judge or  the Secretary's designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public availability of orders. Any final order of the  Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee denying or  sustaining an application for confidential treatment shall be made  public. Any prior findings or opinions relating to an application for  confidential treatment under this section shall be made public at such  time as the material as to which confidentiality was requested is made  public.</p>
