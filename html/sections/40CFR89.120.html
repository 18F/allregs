                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If all test engines representing an engine family have emissions  less than or equal to each emission standard, that family complies with  the emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any test engine representing an engine family has emissions  greater than each emission standard, that family will be deemed not in  compliance with the emission standard(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each nonroad engine family, except Tier 1 engine families  with rated power at or above 37 kW that do not employ aftertreatment, a  deterioration factor must be determined and applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable exhaust emission standards (or family emission  limits, as appropriate) for nonroad compression-ignition engines apply  to the emissions of engines for their useful life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This paragraph (c)(3) describes the procedure for determining  compliance of an engine with emission standards (or family emission  limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration factors supplied by the  manufacturer. The NMHC + NOX deterioration factors shall be  established based on the sum of the pollutants, except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. When establishing deterioration  factors for NMHC + NOX. a negative deterioration (emissions  decrease from the official emissions test result) for one pollutant may  not offset deterioration of the other pollutant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Separate emission deterioration factors, determined by the  manufacturer according to the requirements of Sec. 89.118, shall be  provided in the certification application for each engine-system  combination. Separate deterioration factors shall be established for  each regulated pollutant, except that a combined NMHC + NOX  deterioration factor shall be established for compression-ignition  nonroad engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology. For smoke  testing, separate deterioration factors shall also be established for  the acceleration mode (designated as ``A''), the lugging mode  (designated as ``B''), and peak opacity (designated as ``C'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The emission values to compare with the standards (or family  emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values  of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) through (v) of this section, rounded to the  same number of significant figures as contained in the applicable  standard in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, for each emission data engine.  This procedure has been incorporated by reference at Sec. 89.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all  applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as  determined in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section, before any engine in  that family will be certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For engine families included in the averaging, banking, and  trading program, the families' emission limits (FELs) are used in lieu  of the applicable federal emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For the purposes of setting an NMHC + NOX  certification level or FEL, one of the following options shall be used  for the determination of NMHC for an engine family. The manufacturer  must declare which option is used in its application for certification  of that engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer may assume that up to two percent of the  measured THC is methane (NMHC = 0.98 x THC).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer may measure NMHC emissions using a method  approved by the Administrator prior to the start of testing. This option  allows the determination of NMHC emissions by subtracting measured  methane emissions from measured THC emissions.  [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994.
