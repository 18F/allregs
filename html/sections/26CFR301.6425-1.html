[T.D. 7059, 35 FR 14548, Sept. 17, 1970]</p><p class="depth0">Limitations</p><p class="depth0">Limitations on Assessment and Collection


Sec. 301.6501(a)-1  Period of limitations upon assessment and collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount of any tax imposed by the Code (other than a tax collected by means of stamps) shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed. For rules applicable in cases where the return is filed prior to the due date thereof, see section 6501(b). In the case of taxes payable by stamp, assessment shall be made at any time after the tax became due and before the expiration of 3 years after the date on which any part of the tax was paid. For exceptions and additional rules, see subsections (b) to (g) of section 6501, and for cross references to other provisions relating to limitations on assessment and collection, see sections 6501(h) and 6504.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of any tax shall be begun after the expiration of the applicable period for the assessment of such tax.


Sec. 301.6501(b)-1  Time return deemed filed for purposes ofdetermining limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Early return. Any return, other than a return of tax referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, filed before the last day prescribed by law or regulations for the filing thereof (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing) shall be considered as filed on such last day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Returns of social security tax and of income tax withholding. If a return on or after November 13, 1966, of tax imposed by chapter 3 of the Code (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds), or if a return of tax imposed by chapter 21 of the Code (relating to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or by chapter 24 of the Code (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages), for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April 15 of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be deemed filed on April 15 of such succeeding calendar year. For example, if quarterly returns of the tax imposed by chapter 24 of the Code are filed for the four quarters of 1955 on April 30, July 31, and October 31, 1955, and on January 31, 1956, the period of limitation for assessment with respect to the tax required to be reported on such return is measured from April 15, 1956. However, if any of such returns is filed after April 15, 1956, the period of limitation for assessment of the tax required to be reported on that return is measured from the date it is in fact filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Returns executed by district directors or other internal revenue officers. The execution of a return by a district director or other authorized internal revenue officer or employee under the authority of section 6020(b) shall not start the running of the statutory period of limitations on assessment and collection.


Sec. 301.6501(c)-1  Exceptions to general period of limitationson assessment and collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> False return. In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade any tax, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time after such false or fraudulent return is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Willful attempt to evade tax. In the case of a willful attempt in any manner to defeat or evade any tax imposed by the Code (other than a tax imposed by subtitle A or B, relating to income, estate, or gift taxes), the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No return. In the case of a failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time after the date prescribed for filing the return. For special rules relating to filing a return for chapter 42 and similar taxes, see Sec. Sec. 301.6501(n)-1, 301.6501(n)-2, and 301.6501(n)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extension by agreement. The time prescribed by section 6501 for the assessment of any tax (other than the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 of the Code) may, prior to the expiration of such time, be extended for any period

of time agreed upon in writing by the taxpayer and the district director or an assistant regional commissioner. The extension shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by both parties. The period agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Gifts subject to chapter 14 of the Internal Revenue Code not adequately disclosed on the return. If any transfer of property subject to the special valuation rules of section 2701 or section 2702, or if the occurrence of any taxable event described in section Sec. 25.2701-4 of this chapter, is not adequately shown on a return of tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code (without regard to section 2503(b)), any tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Code on the transfer or resulting from the taxable event may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the appropriate tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adequately shown. A transfer of property valued under the rules of section 2701 or section 2702 or any taxable event described in Sec. 25.2701-4 of this chapter will be considered adequately shown on a return of tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code only if, with respect to the entire transaction or series of transactions (including any transaction that affected the transferred interest) of which the transfer (or taxable event) was a part, the return provides:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the transactions, including a description of transferred and retained interests and the method (or methods) used to value each;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of, and relationship between, the transferor, transferee, all other persons participating in the transactions, and all parties related to the transferor holding an equity interest in any entity involved in the transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A detailed description (including all actuarial factors and discount rates used) of the method used to determine the amount of the gift arising from the transfer (or taxable event), including, in the case of an equity interest that is not actively traded, the financial and other data used in determining value. Financial data should generally include balance sheets and statements of net earnings, operating results, and dividends paid for each of the 5 years immediately before the valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are effective as of January 28, 1992. In determining whether a transfer or taxable event is adequately shown on a gift tax return filed prior to that date, taxpayers may rely on any reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions. For these purposes, the provisions of the proposed regulations and the final regulations are considered a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Gifts made after December 31, 1996, not adequately disclosed on the return--(1) In general. If a transfer of property, other than a transfer described in paragraph (e) of this section, is not adequately disclosed on a gift tax return (Form 709, ``United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return''), or in a statement attached to the return, filed for the calendar period in which the transfer occurs, then any gift tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code on the transfer may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the appropriate tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a transfer of property, other than a transfer described in paragraph (e) of this section, is not adequately disclosed on a gift tax return (Form 709, ``United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return''), or in a statement attached to the return, filed for the calendar period in which the transfer occurs, then any gift tax imposed by chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code on the transfer may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the appropriate tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adequate disclosure of transfers of property reported as gifts. A transfer will be adequately disclosed on the return only if it is reported in a manner adequate to apprise the Internal Revenue Service of the nature of the gift and the basis for the value so reported. Transfers reported on the gift tax return as transfers of property by gift will be considered adequately disclosed under this paragraph (f)(2) if the return (or a statement attached to the return) provides the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the transferred property and any consideration received by the transferor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of, and relationship between, the transferor and each transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the property is transferred in trust, the trust's tax identification number and a brief description of the terms of the trust, or in lieu of a brief

description of the trust terms, a copy of the trust instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 301.6501-1(f)(3), a detailed description of the method used to determine the fair market value of property transferred, including any financial data (for example, balance sheets, etc. with explanations of any adjustments) that were utilized in determining the value of the interest, any restrictions on the transferred property that were considered in determining the fair market value of the property, and a description of any discounts, such as discounts for blockage, minority or fractional interests, and lack of marketability, claimed in valuing the property. In the case of a transfer of an interest that is actively traded on an established exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ National Market, or a regional exchange in which quotations are published on a daily basis, including recognized foreign exchanges, recitation of the exchange where the interest is listed, the CUSIP number of the security, and the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices on the applicable valuation date will satisfy all of the requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(iv). In the case of the transfer of an interest in an entity (for example, a corporation or partnership) that is not actively traded, a description must be provided of any discount claimed in valuing the interests in the entity or any assets owned by such entity. In addition, if the value of the entity or of the interests in the entity is properly determined based on the net value of the assets held by the entity, a statement must be provided regarding the fair market value of 100 percent of the entity (determined without regard to any discounts in valuing the entity or any assets owned by the entity), the pro rata portion of the entity subject to the transfer, and the fair market value of the transferred interest as reported on the return. If 100 percent of the value of the entity is not disclosed, the taxpayer bears the burden of demonstrating that the fair market value of the entity is properly determined by a method other than a method based on the net value of the assets held by the entity. If the entity that is the subject of the transfer owns an interest in another non-actively traded entity (either directly or through ownership of an entity), the information required in this paragraph (f)(2)(iv) must be provided for each entity if the information is relevant and material in determining the value of the interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement describing any position taken that is contrary to any proposed, temporary or final Treasury regulations or revenue rulings published at the time of the transfer (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submission of appraisals in lieu of the information required under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. The requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section will be satisfied if the donor submits an appraisal of the transferred property that meets the following requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The appraisal is prepared by an appraiser who satisfies all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The appraiser is an individual who holds himself or herself out to the public as an appraiser or performs appraisals on a regular basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Because of the appraiser's qualifications, as described in the appraisal that details the appraiser's background, experience, education, and membership, if any, in professional appraisal associations, the appraiser is qualified to make appraisals of the type of property being valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The appraiser is not the donor or the donee of the property or a member of the family of the donor or donee, as defined in section 2032A(e)(2), or any person employed by the donor, the donee, or a member of the family of either; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The appraisal contains all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of the transfer, the date on which the transferred property was appraised, and the purpose of the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the appraisal process employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the assumptions, hypothetical conditions, and any limiting conditions and restrictions on the transferred property that affect the analyses, opinions, and conclusions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The information considered in determining the appraised value, including in the case of an ownership interest in a business, all financial data that was used in determining the value of the interest that is sufficiently detailed so that another person can replicate the process and arrive at the appraised value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The valuation method utilized, the rationale for the valuation method, and the procedure used in determining the fair market value of the asset transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The specific basis for the valuation, such as specific comparable sales or transactions, sales of similar interests, asset-based approaches, merger-acquisition transactions, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adequate disclosure of non-gift completed transfers or transactions. Completed transfers to members of the transferor's family, as defined in section 2032A(e)(2), that are made in the ordinary course of operating a business are deemed to be adequately disclosed under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, even if the transfer is not reported on a gift tax return, provided the transfer is properly reported by all parties for income tax purposes. For example, in the case of salary paid to a family member employed in a family owned business, the transfer will be treated as adequately disclosed for gift tax purposes if the item is properly reported by the business and the family member on their income tax returns. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), any other completed transfer that is reported, in its entirety, as not constituting a transfer by gift will be considered adequately disclosed under paragraph (f)(2) of this section only if the following information is provided on, or attached to, the return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The information required for adequate disclosure under paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) and (v) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation as to why the transfer is not a transfer by gift under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adequate disclosure of incomplete transfers. Adequate disclosure of a transfer that is reported as a completed gift on the gift tax return will commence the running of the period of limitations for assessment of gift tax on the transfer, even if the transfer is ultimately determined to be an incomplete gift for purposes of Sec. 25.2511-2 of this chapter. For example, if an incomplete gift is reported as a completed gift on the gift tax return and is adequately disclosed, the period for assessment of the gift tax will begin to run when the return is filed, as determined under section 6501(b). Further, once the period of assessment for gift tax expires, the transfer will be subject to inclusion in the donor's gross estate for estate tax purposes only to the extent that a completed gift would be so included. On the other hand, if the transfer is reported as an incomplete gift whether or not adequately disclosed, the period for assessing a gift tax with respect to the transfer will not commence to run even if the transfer is ultimately determined to be a completed gift. In that situation, the gift tax with respect to the transfer may be assessed at any time, up until three years after the donor files a return reporting the transfer as a completed gift with adequate disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Treatment of split gifts. If a husband and wife elect under section 2513 to treat a gift made to a third party as made one-half by each spouse, the requirements of this paragraph (f) will be satisfied with respect to the gift deemed made by the consenting spouse if the return filed by the donor spouse (the spouse that transferred the property) satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f) with respect to that gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2001, A transfers 100 shares of common stock of XYZ Corporation to A's child. The common stock of XYZ Corporation is actively traded on a major stock exchange. For gift tax purposes, the fair market value of one share of XYZ common stock on the date of the transfer, determined in accordance with Sec. 25.2512-2(b) of this chapter (based on the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices), is $150.00. On A's Federal gift tax return, Form 709, for the 2001 calendar year, A reports the gift to

A's child of 100 shares of common stock of XYZ Corporation with a value for gift tax purposes of $15,000. A specifies the date of the transfer, recites that the stock is publicly traded, identifies the stock exchange on which the stock is traded, lists the stock's CUSIP number, and lists the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices for the date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the adequate disclosure standard. A has adequately disclosed the transfer. Therefore, the period of assessment for the transfer under section 6501 will run from the time the return is filed (as determined under section 6501(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On December 30, 2001, A transfers closely-held stock to B, A's child. A determined that the value of the transferred stock, on December 30, 2001, was $9,000. A made no other transfers to B, or any other donee, during 2001. On A's Federal gift tax return, Form 709, for the 2001 calendar year, A provides the information required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section such that the transfer is adequately disclosed. A claims an annual exclusion under section 2503(b) for the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the adequate disclosure standard. Because the transfer is adequately disclosed under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the period of assessment for the transfer will expire as prescribed by section 6501(b), notwithstanding that if A's valuation of the closely-held stock was correct, A was not required to file a gift tax return reporting the transfer under section 6019. After the period of assessment has expired on the transfer, the Internal Revenue Service is precluded from redetermining the amount of the gift for purposes of assessing gift tax or for purposes of determining the estate tax liability. Therefore, the amount of the gift as reported on A's 2001 Federal gift tax return may not be redetermined for purposes of determining A's prior taxable gifts (for gift tax purposes) or A's adjusted taxable gifts (for estate tax purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A owns 100 percent of the common stock of X, a closely-held corporation. X does not hold an interest in any other entity that is not actively traded. In 2001, A transfers 20 percent of the X stock to B and C, A's children, in a transfer that is not subject to the special valuation rules of section 2701. The transfer is made outright with no restrictions on ownership rights, including voting rights and the right to transfer the stock. Based on generally applicable valuation principles, the value of X would be determined based on the net value of the assets owned by X. The reported value of the transferred stock incorporates the use of minority discounts and lack of marketability discounts. No other discounts were used in arriving at the fair market value of the transferred stock or any assets owned by X. On A's Federal gift tax return, Form 709, for the 2001 calendar year, A provides the information required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section including a statement reporting the fair market value of 100 percent of X (before taking into account any discounts), the pro rata portion of X subject to the transfer, and the reported value of the transfer. A also attaches a statement regarding the determination of value that includes a discussion of the discounts claimed and how the discounts were determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the adequate disclosure standard. A has provided sufficient information such that the transfer will be considered adequately disclosed and the period of assessment for the transfer under section 6501 will run from the time the return is filed (as determined under section 6501(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A owns a 70 percent limited partnership interest in PS. PS owns 40 percent of the stock in X, a closely-held corporation. The assets of X include a 50 percent general partnership interest in PB. PB owns an interest in commercial real property. None of the entities (PS, X, or PB) is actively traded and, based on generally applicable valuation principles, the value of each entity would be determined based on the net value of the assets owned by each entity. In 2001, A transfers a 25 percent limited partnership interest in PS to B, A's child. On the Federal gift tax return, Form 709, for the 2001 calendar year, A reports the transfer of the 25 percent limited partnership interest in PS and that the fair market value of 100 percent of PS is $y and that the value of 25 percent of PS is $z, reflecting marketability and minority discounts with respect to the 25 percent interest. However, A does not disclose that PS owns 40 percent of X, and that X owns 50 percent of PB and that, in arriving at the $y fair market value of 100 percent of PS, discounts were claimed in valuing PS's interest in X, X's interest in PB, and PB's interest in the commercial real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the adequate disclosure standard. The information on the lower tiered entities is relevant and material in determining the value of the transferred interest in PS. Accordingly, because A has failed to comply with requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section regarding PS's interest in X, X's interest in PB, and PB's interest in the commercial real property, the transfer will not be considered adequately disclosed and the period of assessment for the transfer under section 6501 will remain open indefinitely.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that A submits, with the Federal tax return, an appraisal of the 25 percent limited partnership interest in PS that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section in lieu of the information required in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. Assuming the other requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section are satisfied, the

transfer is considered adequately disclosed and the period for assessment for the transfer under section 6501 will run from the time the return is filed (as determined under section 6501(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. A owns 100 percent of the stock of X Corporation, a company actively engaged in a manufacturing business. B, A's child, is an employee of X and receives an annual salary paid in the ordinary course of operating X Corporation. B reports the annual salary as income on B's income tax returns. In 2001, A transfers property to family members and files a Federal gift tax return reporting the transfers. However, A does not disclose the 2001 salary payments made to B. Because the salary payments were reported as income on B's income tax return, the salary payments are deemed to be adequately disclosed. The transfer of property to family members, other than the salary payments to B, reported on the gift tax return must satisfy the adequate disclosure requirements under paragraph (f)(2) of this section in order for the period of assessment under section 6501 to commence to run with respect to those transfers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (f) is applicable to gifts made after December 31, 1996, for which the gift tax return for such calendar year is filed after December 3, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Listed transactions--(1) In general. If a taxpayer is required to disclose a listed transaction under section 6011 and the regulations thereunder and does not do so in the time and manner required, then the time to assess any tax attributable to that listed transaction for the taxable year(s) to which the failure to disclose relates (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section) will not expire before the earlier of one year after the date on which the taxpayer makes the disclosure described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section or one year after the date on which a material advisor makes a disclosure described in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. In no case will the operation of this paragraph (g) cause the period of limitations on assessment to expire any earlier than the period that would have otherwise applied under this section determined without regard to this paragraph (g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a taxpayer is required to disclose a listed transaction under section 6011 and the regulations thereunder and does not do so in the time and manner required, then the time to assess any tax attributable to that listed transaction for the taxable year(s) to which the failure to disclose relates (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section) will not expire before the earlier of one year after the date on which the taxpayer makes the disclosure described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section or one year after the date on which a material advisor makes a disclosure described in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. In no case will the operation of this paragraph (g) cause the period of limitations on assessment to expire any earlier than the period that would have otherwise applied under this section determined without regard to this paragraph (g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations period if paragraph (g)(5) or (g)(6) is satisfied. If one of the disclosure provisions described in paragraphs (g)(5) or (6) of this section is satisfied, then the tax attributable to the listed transaction may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the limitations period that would have otherwise applied under this section (determined without regard to paragraph (g)(1) of this section) or the period ending one year after the date that one of the disclosure provisions described in paragraphs (g)(5) or (6) of this section was satisfied, whichever is later. If both disclosure provisions are satisfied, the one-year period will begin on the earlier of the dates on which the provisions were satisfied. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to any period of limitations on assessment that expired before the date on which the failure to disclose the listed transaction under section 6011 occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions--(i) Listed transaction. The term listed transaction means a transaction described in section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Listed transaction. The term listed transaction means a transaction described in section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Material advisor. The term material advisor means a person described in section 6111(b)(1) of the Code and Sec. 301.6111-3(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Taxable year(s) to which the failure to disclose relates. The taxable year(s) to which the failure to disclose relates are each taxable year that the taxpayer participated (as defined under section 6011 and the regulations thereunder) in a transaction that was identified as a listed transaction and the taxpayer failed to disclose the listed transaction as required under section 6011. If the taxable year in which the taxpayer participated in the listed transaction is different from the taxable year in which the taxpayer is required to disclose the listed transaction under section 6011, the taxable year(s) to which the failure to disclose relates are each taxable year that the taxpayer participated in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of paragraph with respect to pass-through entities. In the case of taxpayers who are partners in partnerships, shareholders in S corporations, or beneficiaries of trusts and are required to disclose a listed transaction under section 6011 and the regulations thereunder, paragraph (g)(1) of this section will apply to a particular partner, shareholder, or beneficiary if that particular partner, shareholder, or beneficiary does not disclose within the

Similarly, because paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies on a taxpayer-by-taxpayer basis, the failure of a partnership, S corporation, or trust that has a disclosure obligation under section 6011 and that does not disclose within the time or in the form and manner provided by Sec. 1.6011-4(d) and (e) will not cause paragraph (g)(1) of this section to apply to a partner, shareholder or beneficiary of the entity.

If the period of limitations on assessment for a taxable year remains open under this section, the Secretary has authority to assess any tax with respect to the listed transaction in that year. This includes, but is not limited to, adjustments made to the tax consequences claimed on the return plus interest, additions to tax, additional amounts, and penalties that are related to the listed transaction or adjustments made to the tax consequences. This also includes any item to the extent the item is affected by the listed transaction even if it is unrelated to the listed transaction. An example of an item affected by, but unrelated to, a listed transaction is the threshold for the medical expense deduction under section 213 that varies if there is a change in an individual's adjusted gross income. An example of a penalty related to the listed transaction is the penalty under section 6707A for failure to file the disclosure statement reporting the taxpayer's participation in the listed transaction. Examples of penalties related to the adjustments made to the tax consequences are the accuracy-related penalties under sections 6662 and 6662A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. No requirement to disclose under section 6011. P, an individual, is a partner in a partnership that entered into a transaction in 2001 that was the same as or substantially similar to the transaction identified as a listed transaction in Notice 2000-44 (2000-2 CB 255). P claimed a loss from the transaction on his Form 1040 for the tax year 2001. P filed the Form 1040 prior to June 14, 2002. P did not disclose his participation in the listed transaction because P was not required to disclose the transaction under the applicable section 6011 regulations (TD 8961), which were effective for any transaction entered into before January 1, 2001 and any transaction entered into on or after January 1, 2001 that was reported on a return of the taxpayer filed on or before June 14, 2002. Although the transaction was a listed transaction and P did not disclose the transaction, P had no obligation to include on any return or statement any information with respect to a listed transaction within the meaning of section 6501(c)(10) because TD 8961 only applied to corporations, not individuals. Accordingly, section 6501(c)(10) does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On December 30, 2003, Y, a corporation, enters into a transaction that at the time is not a reportable transaction. On March 15, 2004, Y timely files its 2003 Form 1120, reporting the tax consequences from the transaction. On April 1, 2004, the IRS issues Notice 2004-31 that identifies the transaction as a listed transaction. Y also reports tax consequences from the transaction on its 2004 Form 1120, which it timely filed on March 15, 2005. Y did not attach a completed Form 8886 to its 2004 Form 1120 and did not send a copy of the form to OTSA. The general three-year period of limitations on assessment for Y's 2003 and 2004 taxable years would expire on March 15, 2007, and March 17, 2008, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period of limitations on assessment for Y's 2003 taxable year was open on the date the transaction was identified as a listed transaction. Under the applicable section 6011 regulations (TD 9108), which were effective for transactions entered into before August 3, 2007, Y should have disclosed its participation in the transaction with its next filed return, which was its 2004 Form 1120, but Y did not disclose its participation. Y's failure to disclose with the 2004 Form 1120 relates to taxable years 2003 and 2004. Section 6501(c)(10) operates to keep the period of limitations on assessment open for the 2003 and 2004 taxable years with respect to the listed transaction until at least one year after the date Y satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section or a material advisor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In January 2015, A, a

calendar year taxpayer, enters into a transaction that at the time is not a listed transaction. A reports the tax consequences from the transaction on its individual income tax return for 2015 timely filed on April 15, 2016. The time for the IRS to assess tax against A under the general three-year period of limitations for A's 2015 taxable year would expire on April 15, 2019. A only participated in the transaction in 2015. On March 7, 2017, the IRS identifies the transaction as a listed transaction. A does not file the Form 8886 with OTSA by June 5, 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period of limitations on assessment for A's 2015 taxable year was open on the date the transaction was identified as a listed transaction.

A did not disclose the transaction as required. A's failure to disclose relates to taxable year 2015 even though the obligation to disclose did not arise until 2017. Section 6501(c)(10) operates to keep the period of limitations on assessment open for the 2015 taxable year with respect to the listed transaction until at least one year after the date A satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section or a material advisor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Requirements of paragraph (g)(6) satisfied. Same facts as Example 3, except that on April 5, 2019, the IRS hand delivers to Advisor J, who is a material advisor, a section 6112 request related to the listed transaction. Advisor J furnishes the required list with all the information required by section 6112 and Sec. 301.6112-1, including all the information required with respect to A, to the IRS on May 8, 2019. The submission satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) even though Advisor J furnishes the information outside of the 20-business-day period provided in section 6708. Accordingly, under section 6501(c)(10), the period of limitations with respect to A's taxable year 2015 will end on May 8, 2020, one year after the IRS received the required information, unless the period of limitations remains open under another exception. Any tax for the 2015 taxable year not attributable to the listed transaction must be assessed by April 15, 2019.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Requirements of paragraph (g)(5) also satisfied. Same facts as Examples 3 and 4, except that on May 23, 2019, A files a properly completed Form 8886 and signed cover letter with OTSA both identifying that the section 6501(c)(10) disclosure relates to A's Form 1040 for 2015. A satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section as of May 23, 2019. Because the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) were satisfied first as described in Example 4, under section 6501(c)(10) the period of limitations will end on May 8, 2020 (one year after the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) were satisfied) instead of May 23, 2020 (one year after the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) were satisfied). Any tax for the 2015 taxable year not attributable to the listed transaction must be assessed by April 15, 2019.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Period to assess tax remains open under another exception. Same facts as Examples 3, 4, and 5, except that on April 1, 2019, A signed Form 872, consenting to extend, without restriction, its period of limitations on assessment for taxable year 2015 under section 6501(c)(4) until July 15, 2020. In that case, although under section 6501(c)(10) the period of limitations would otherwise expire on May 8, 2020, the IRS may assess tax with respect to the listed transaction (as well as any other item on the return covered by the Form 872 extension) at any time up to and including July 15, 2020, pursuant to section 6501(c)(4). Section 6501(c)(10) operates to extend the assessment period but not to shorten any other applicable assessment period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Requirements of (g)(5) not satisfied. In 2015, X, a corporation, enters into a listed transaction. On March 15, 2016, X timely files its 2015 Form 1120, reporting the tax consequences from the transaction. X does not disclose the transaction as required under section 6011 when it files its 2015 return. The failure to disclose relates to taxable year 2015. On February 13, 2017, X completes and files a Form 8886 with respect to the listed transaction with OTSA but does not submit a cover letter, as required. The requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section have not been satisfied. Therefore, the time to assess tax against X with respect to the transaction for taxable year 2015 remains open under section 6501(c)(10).</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Section 6501(c)(10) applies to keep one partner's period of limitations on assessment open. T and S are partners in a partnership, TS, that enters into a listed transaction in 2015. T and S each receive a Schedule K-1 from TS on April 11, 2016. On April 15, 2016, TS, T and S each file their 2015 returns. Under the applicable section 6011 regulations, TS, T, and S each are required to disclose the transaction. TS attaches a completed Form 8886 to its 2015 Form 1065 and sends a copy of Form 8886 to OTSA. Neither T nor S files a disclosure statement with their respective returns nor sends a copy to OTSA on April 15, 2016. On May 17, 2016, T timely files a completed Form 8886 with OTSA pursuant to Sec. 1.6011-4(e)(1). T's disclosure is timely because T received the Schedule K-1 within 10 calendar days before the due date of the return and, thus, T had 60 calendar days to file Form 8886 with OTSA. TS and T properly disclosed the transaction

in accordance with the applicable regulations under section 6011, but S did not. S's failure to disclose relates to taxable year 2015. The time to assess tax with respect to the transaction against S for 2015 remains open under section 6501(c)(10) even though TS and T disclosed the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Section 6501(c)(10) satisfied before expiration of three-year period of limitations under section 6501(a). Same facts as Example 8, except that on August 26, 2016, S satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section. No material advisor satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to S on a date earlier than August 26, 2016. Under section 6501(c)(10), the period of time in which the IRS may assess tax against S with respect to the listed transaction would expire no earlier than August 26, 2017, one year after the date S satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(5). As the general three-year period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) does not expire until April 15, 2019, the IRS will have until that date to assess any tax with respect to the listed transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. No section 6112 request. B, a calendar year taxpayer, entered into a listed transaction in 2015. B did not comply with the applicable disclosure requirements under section 6011 for taxable year 2015; therefore, section 6501(c)(10) applies to keep the period of limitations on assessment open with respect to the tax related to the transaction until at least one year after B satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section or a material advisor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to B. In June 2016, the IRS conducts a section 6700 investigation of Advisor K, who is a material advisor to B with respect to the listed transaction. During the course of the investigation, the IRS obtains the name, address, and TIN of all of Advisor K's clients who engaged in the transaction, including B. The information provided does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) with respect to B because the information was not provided pursuant to a section 6112 request. Therefore, the time to assess tax against B with respect to the transaction for taxable year 2015 remains open under section 6501(c)(10).</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Section 6112 request but the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) are not satisfied with respect to B. Same facts as Example 10, except that on January 9, 2017, the IRS sends by certified mail a section 6112 request to Advisor L, who is another material advisor to B with respect to the listed transaction. Advisor L furnishes some of the information required under section 6112 and Sec. 301.6112-1 to the IRS for inspection on January 17, 2017. The list includes information with respect to many clients of Advisor L, but it does not include any information with respect to B. The submission does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to B. Therefore, the time to assess tax against B with respect to the transaction for taxable year 2015 remains open under section 6501(c)(10).</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Section 6112 submission made before taxpayer failed to disclose a listed transaction. Advisor M, who is a material advisor, advises C, an individual, in 2015 with respect to a transaction that is not a reportable transaction at that time. C files its return claiming the tax consequences of the transaction on April 15, 2016. The time for the IRS to assess tax against C under the general three-year period of limitations for C's 2015 taxable year would expire on April 15, 2019. The IRS identifies the transaction as a listed transaction on November 3, 2017. On December 7, 2017, the IRS hand delivers to Advisor M a section 6112 request related to the transaction. Advisor M furnishes the information to the IRS on December 29, 2017. The information contains all the required information with respect to Advisor M's clients, including C. C does not disclose the transaction on or before February 1, 2018, as required under section 6011 and the regulations under section 6011. Advisor M's submission under section 6112 satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section even though it occurred prior to C's failure to disclose the listed transaction. Thus, under section 6501(c)(10), the period of limitations to assess tax against C with respect to the listed transaction will end on December 29, 2018 (one year after the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section were satisfied), unless the period of limitations remains open under another exception.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Transaction removed from the category of listed transactions after taxpayer failed to disclose. D, a calendar year taxpayer, entered into a listed transaction in 2015. D did not comply with the applicable disclosure requirements under section 6011 for taxable year 2015; therefore, section 6501(c)(10) applies to keep the period of limitations on assessment open with respect to the tax related to the transaction until at least one year after D satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section or a material advisor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to D. In 2017, the IRS removes the transaction from the category of listed transactions because of a change in law. Section 6501(c)(10) continues to apply to keep the period of limitations on assessment open for D's taxable year 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, an individual, enters into a listed transaction in 2015. F files its 2015 Form 1040 on April 15, 2016, but does not disclose his participation in the listed transaction in accordance with section 6011 and the regulations under section 6011. F's failure to disclose relates to taxable year 2015.

Thus, section 6501(c)(10) applies to keep the period of limitations on assessment open with respect to the tax related to the listed transaction for taxable year 2015 until at least one year after the date F satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(5) of this section or a material advisor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section with respect to F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On July 2, 2020, the IRS completes an examination of F's 2015 taxable year and disallows the tax consequences claimed as a result of the listed transaction. The disallowance of a loss increased F's adjusted gross income. Due to the increase of F's adjusted gross income, certain credits, such as the child tax credit, and exemption deductions were disallowed or reduced because of limitations based on adjusted gross income. In addition, F now is liable for the alternative minimum tax. The examination also uncovered that F claimed two deductions on Schedule C to which F was not entitled. Under section 6501(c)(10), the IRS can timely issue a statutory notice of deficiency (and assess in due course) against F for the deficiency resulting from (1) disallowing the loss, (2) disallowing the credits and exemptions to which F was not entitled based on F's increased adjusted gross income, and (3) being liable for the alternative minimum tax. In addition, the IRS can assess any interest and applicable penalties related to those adjustments, such as the accuracy-related penalty under sections 6662 and 6662A and the penalty under section 6707A for F's failure to disclose the transaction as required under section 6011 and the regulations under section 6011. The IRS cannot, however, pursuant to section 6501(c)(10), assess the increase in tax that would result from disallowing the two deductions on F's Schedule C because those deductions are not related to, or affected by, the adjustments concerning the listed transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 301.6501(n)-2  Certain contributions to section 501(c)(3) organizations.</p><p class="depth0">If a private foundation makes a contribution to a section 501(c)(3) organization as provided in section 4942(g)(3), and a deficiency of tax of such foundation occurs due to the failure of the section 501(c)(3) organization to make the distribution prescribed by section 4942(g)(3), then such deficiency may be assessed within one year after the expiration of the period within which a deficiency may be assessed for the taxable year with respect to which the contribution was made.

Sec. 301.6501(o)-2  Special rules for partnership items offederally registered partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A with respect to any person, the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered partnership shall not expire before the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date which is 4 years after the date on which the return of the federally registered partnership for the partnership taxable year in which the item arose is filed (or, if later, the date prescribed for filing the return), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the name or address of the person against whom the assessment is sought does not appear on the return of the federally registered partnership, the date which is 1 year after the date on which a satisfactory identifying statement is furnished in writing to the director of the service center with which the partnership return is filed. A satisfactory identifying statement is a written statement providing the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of both the partner and the partnership. The statement shall note the partnership taxable year for which the statement is furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ``Pass through'' entity as partner. In the case of a partnership having a ``pass through'' entity (i.e., partnership, electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), trust, estate, or nominee) as a partner, the 1 year period described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not begin with respect to the person to be assessed until the chain of ownership linking the taxpayer with the federally registered partnership in which the item originally arose is fully disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership U, a federally registered partnership, has two partners, Partnerships W and X. The partners of W are A and B, who are individuals, and T, a trust whose beneficiaries are individuals C and D. The partners of X are E, an individual, and Partnership Y whose partners are individuals F, G, and H. U and X properly disclose the identity of their partners. W, however, discloses the identity of only A and B, and Y discloses the identity of only F and G. The period of limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section for items attributable to U does not expire with respect to T, C, D, and H until one year after the chain of ownership linking these taxpayers with U is fully disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federally registered partnership--(1) In general. With respect to any partnership taxable year, a federally registered partnership is any partnership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. With respect to any partnership taxable year, a federally registered partnership is any partnership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interests in which have been offered for sale at any time during the taxable year or a prior taxable year in an offering required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Which, at any time during the taxable year or a prior taxable year, was subject to the annual reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission which relate to the protection of investors in the partnership.

For purposes of the preceding sentence an interest is ``offered for sale'' when it is the subject of an ``offer for sale'' as that term is used in section 2 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain reporting requirements not taken into account. A requirement to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission for any purpose other than to protect investors does not cause the partnership to be treated as a federally registered partnership. For example, a brokerage firm organized as a partnership is not a federally registered partnership merely because it files reports required by the Commission for regulatory purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extension by agreement--(1) In general. Any general partner of a federally registered partnership (or any other person authorized by the partnership) may, prior to the expiration of the limitation period described in paragraph (a) of this section, extend the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to a partnership item for any period of time agreed upon in writing. The extension shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by the district director or the service center director and shall be binding on all persons whose liability for tax imposed by subtitle A is affected in whole or in part

by partnership items flowing from the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Any general partner of a federally registered partnership (or any other person authorized by the partnership) may, prior to the expiration of the limitation period described in paragraph (a) of this section, extend the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to a partnership item for any period of time agreed upon in writing. The extension shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by the district director or the service center director and shall be binding on all persons whose liability for tax imposed by subtitle A is affected in whole or in part

by partnership items flowing from the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorization of other persons. The partnership may authorize persons other than the general partners to extend the period of limitation for assessing a deficiency attributable to a partnership item. This authorization shall be in writing, shall clearly identify the person being authorized and the action being authorized, and shall be signed by all the general partners. The authorization shall become effective when filed with the district director and shall remain in effect until a written revocation signed as provided in the preceding sentence is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Removing authority of general partners. A partnership wishing to deny to some or all of the general partners the authority to execute an agreement extending the period of limitation for assessment may do so by submitting a written statement to that effect. The statement shall either identify the partners exclusively authorized to execute such an agreement or declare that one or more named partners or all partners lack the authority to execute such an agreement. The statement shall be signed by all the general partners. The statement shall become effective when filed with the district director and shall remain in effect until a statement revoking or superseding it and signed as provided in the preceding sentence is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special period of limitation with respect to carryback of net operating loss, capital, loss, etc. The provisions of section 6501(o) must also be taken into account in applying the various special periods of limitation prescribed in sections 6501 (h), (i) and (j). Thus, to the extent that a carryback is attributable to a partnership item of a federally registered partnership, the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to that carryback shall not expire before the date determined under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the partnership taxable year in which the item arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Otherwise applicable limitation period. The special provisions of section 6501(o) and this section do not terminate any otherwise applicable period for assessing a deficiency. Thus, the fact that more than 4 years have elapsed since the filing of the partnership return for the year in issue does not prevent assessment against a partner based on partnership items if an otherwise applicable period of limitation for the partner has not yet expired</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership V files its return for the taxable year ending December 31, 1980, on April 15, 1981. A, a partner in Partnership V, agrees to extend the assessment period for A's taxable year ending December 31, 1980, until September 30, 1985. The partnership does not agree to any extension under section 6501(o)(3) so that the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to partnership items could expire on April 15, 1985. A deficiency may be assessed against A for 1980 at any time prior to October 1, 1985, even if that deficiency is based on partnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section and Sec. 301.6501(o)-3 are effective generally for partnership items arising in partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978 and before September 4, 1982. This section shall not apply, however, to any partnership taxable year with respect to which the amendments made to Code section 6501(o) by section 402 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 are effective. See section 407(a)(3) of that Act.
(Sec. 6501(o) (as it read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (92 Stat. 2818, 26 U.S.C. 6501(o); 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805))
[T.D. 7884, 48 FR 16242, Apr. 15, 1983]


Sec. 301.6501(o)-3  Partnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Partnership item defined. For purposes of section 6501(o) (as it read before the enactment of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982), Sec. 301.6501(o)-2, and Sec. 301.6511(g)-1, the term ``partnership item'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any item required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code, to the extent that the item is designated in paragraph (b) of this section as more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any other item to the extent affected by an item described in paragraph (b) of this section.
The items described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section include items related to

the partnership (for example, a partner's basis in the partnership interest) as well as more general items whose computation may be affected by changes to items described in paragraph (b) of this section (for example, adjusted gross income, self-employment tax, income averaging, medical deduction, and charitable contribution deduction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Items more appropriately determined at the partnership level. The following items which are required to be taken into account for the taxable year of a partnership under subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code are more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The partnership aggregate and each partner's share of each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenditures by the partnership not deductible in computing its taxable income (for example, foreign taxes and charitable contributions);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Items of the partnership which may be tax preference items under section 57(a) for any partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income of the partnership exempt from tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Partnership liabilities (including determinations with respect to the amount of the liabilities, whether the liabilities are nonrecourse, and changes from the preceding taxable year); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other amounts with respect to partnership investments, transactions, and operations necessary to enable partners to compute--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The credit provided by section 38;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recapture under section 47 of the credit provided by section 38,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Their amounts at risk in any activity to which section 465 applies, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The depletion allowance under section 613A with respect to oil and gas wells;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Guaranteed payments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property pursuant to an election under section 754 (including necessary preliminary determinations, such as the determination of a transferee partner's basis in a partnership interest); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To the extent that the determination can be made from determinations that are necessary at the partnership level with respect to an amount, the character of an amount, or the percentage interest of a partner in the partnership for purposes of the partnership books and records or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contributions to the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions from the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts to be taken into account by a partner dealing with the partnership in a transaction to which section 707(a) applies (including the application of section 707(b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The application to the distributee partner of section 751(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The application to the transferor partner of section 751(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustrations. This paragraph (c) illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The factors enumerated are not exhaustive; there may be additional partnership-level determinations with respect to a determination listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The character of an amount received from a partner (for example, whether it is a contribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of money contributed by a partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The applicability of the investment company rules of section 721(b) with respect to a contribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The basis to the partnership of contributed property. To the extent that a determination with respect to a contribution can be made from these and similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, the determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that determination is more appropriately made at the partner level. For example, it may be necessary to determine whether the contribution of the property causes recapture from the contributing partner of the credit provided under section 38 in certain circumstances in which that

determination is irrelevant to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distribution. For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The charter of an amount transferred to a partner (for example, whether it is a distribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of money distributed to a partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The adjusted basis to the partnership of distributed property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The character of partnership property (for example, whether an item is inventory or a capital asset). To the extent that a determination with respect to a distribution can be made from these and similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, the determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. Such other information would include certain factors used in determining the partner's basis for the partnership interest, such as the amount that the partner paid to acquire the partnership interest from a transferor partner if that transfer was not covered by an election under section 754.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transactions to which section 707(a) applies. For purposes of its books and records, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount transferred from the partnership to a partner or from a partner to the partnership in any transaction to which section 707(a) applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The character of such an amount (for example, whether or not it is a loan; in the case of amounts paid over time for the purchase of an asset, what portion is interest); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of the capital interests and profits interests in the partnership owned by each partner.
To the extent that a determination with respect to a transaction to which section 707(a) applies can be made from these and similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, that determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that the determination requires other information, however, that determination is more appropriately made at the partner level. Examples of such other information are the cost to the partner of goods sold to the partnership and the extent to which the partner may be treated under section 267(c) as the constructive owner of a capital or profits interest actually owned by another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of section 751. For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner for use in applying section 751, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fair market value and adjusted basis of the partnership's--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Unrealized receivables (within the meaning of section 751(c)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Substantially appreciated inventory (within the meaning of section 751(d)), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A partner's share of each of the classes of assets described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether a distribution to a partner is a disproportionate distribution subject to section 751(b).

To the extent that a determination with respect to the application of section 751 can be made from these and similar partnership-level determinations, therefore, that determination is more appropriately made at the partnership level. To the extent that the determination requires other information, however, that determination is more appropriately made at the partner level. An example of such other information is the amount realized by a partner on the sale of a partnership interest.
