                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NCUA Board may exempt federally insured state chartered  credit unions in a given state from NCUA's member business loan rule if  NCUA approves the state's rule for use for state chartered federally  insured credit unions. In making this determination, the Board is guided  by safety and soundness considerations and reviews whether the state  regulation minimizes the risk and accomplishes the overall objectives of  NCUA's member business loan rule in this part. Specifically, the Board  will focus its review on:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The definition of a member business loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loan to one borrower limits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written loan policies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collateral and security requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Construction and development lending; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Loans to senior management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To receive NCUA's approval of a state's member business loan  rule, the state supervisory authority must submit its rule to the NCUA  regional office. After reviewing the rule, the region will forward the  request to the NCUA Board for a final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A state supervisory authority that administers a state member  business loans rule, approved by NCUA under Sec. 723.20(a) and (b), may  rescind its rule without NCUA approval. A state supervisory authority  should notify NCUA if it anticipates rescinding its rule to foster  regulatory continuity and cooperation.
