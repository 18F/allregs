                            <p class="depth0">The Act contains several provisions which relate to environmental  protection. For example, section 105(a)(4) requires that, before the  Administrator may issue a commercial recovery permit, he must find that  the commercial recovery proposed in the application cannot reasonably be  expected to result in a significant adverse environmental effect. In  addition, each permit issued must contain TCRs which prescribe actions  the permittee must take in the conduct of commercial recovery activities  to assure protection of the environment (section 109(b)). The Act also  provides for modification by the Administrator of any TCR if relevant  data and information indicate that modification is required to protect  the quality of the environment (section 105(c)(1)(B)). The Administrator  also may order an immediate suspension or modification of activities  (section 106(c)), or require use of best available technologies (section  109(b)), to prevent a significant adverse environmental effect.  Furthermore, each permit issued under the Act must require the permittee  to monitor the environmental effects of commercial recovery activities  in accordance with guidelines issued by the Administrator, and to submit  information the Administrator finds necessary and appropriate to assess  environmental effects and to develop and evaluate possible methods of  mitigating adverse effects (section 114).</p>
