(1) The standard of quality for canned fruit cocktail is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of quality for canned fruit cocktail is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not more than 20 percent by weight of the units in the container of peach or pear, or of pineapple if the units thereof are diced, are more than \3/4\ inch in greatest edge dimension, or pass through the meshes of a sieve designated as \5/16\ inch that complies with the specifications for such cloth set

forth in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, ``Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),'' under the heading ``Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,'' which is incorporated by reference.

If the units of pineapple are in the form of sectors, not more than 20 percent of such sectors in the container fail to conform to the following dimensions: The length of the outside arc is not more than \3/4\ inch but is more than \3/8\ inch; the thickness is not more than \1/2\ inch but is more than \5/16\ inch; the length (measured along the radius from the inside arc to the outside arc) is not more than 1\1/4\ inches but is more than \3/4\ inch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not more than 10 percent of the grapes in a container containing 10 grapes or more, and not more than 1 grape in a container containing less than 10 grapes, are cracked to the extent of being severed into two parts or are crushed to the extent that their normal shape is destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not more than 10 percent of the grapes in a container containing 10 grapes or more, and not more than a grape in a container containing less than 10 grapes, have the cap stem attached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is present in the finished canned fruit cocktail not more than 1 square inch of pear peel per each 1 pound of drained weight of units of pear plus the weight of a proportion of the packing medium which is the same proportion as the drained weight of the units of pear bears to the drained weight of the entire contents of the can. Such drained weights shall be determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> There is present in the finished canned fruit cocktail not more than 1 square inch of peach peel per each 1 pound of drained weight of units of peach plus the weight of a proportion of the packing medium which is the same proportion as the drained weight of units of peach bears to the drained weight of the entire contents of the can. Such drained weights shall be determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Not more than 15 percent of the units of cherry ingredient, and not more than 20 percent of the units of peach, pear, or grape, in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, scar tissue or other abnormality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If the cherry ingredient is artificially colored, the color of not more than 15 percent of the units thereof in a container containing more than six units and of not more than one unit in a container containing six units or less, is other than evenly distributed in the unit or other than uniform with the color of the other units of the cherry ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the quality of canned fruit cocktail falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in Sec. 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fill of container. (1) The standard of fill of container for canned fruit cocktail is a fill such that the total weight of drained fruit is not less than 65 percent of the water capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for water capacity of containers prescribed in Sec. 130.12(a) of this chapter. Such total weight of drained fruit is determined by the following method: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has been previously weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 8 inches if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 3 pounds, and 12 inches if such quantity is 3 pounds or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth under ``2.38 mm (No. 8)'' in Table 1, ``Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),'' prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this

section, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Without shifting the material on the sieve so incline the sieve as to facilitate drainage. Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained fruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the total weight of drained fruit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of fill of container for canned fruit cocktail is a fill such that the total weight of drained fruit is not less than 65 percent of the water capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for water capacity of containers prescribed in Sec. 130.12(a) of this chapter.
