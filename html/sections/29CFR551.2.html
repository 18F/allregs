Such findings shall be  made only upon petitions meeting the requirements of this part, and only  as authorized in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(11)</em> for an exemption from the overtime provisions of the Act, the  Administrator shall have authority, upon a proper showing and in  accordance with the provisions of this part, to make a finding as to the  general purpose and effect of any specific plan of compensation on the  basis of trip rates or other delivery payment plan, with respect to the  reduction of the length of the workweeks worked by the employees of any  specific employer who are compensated in accordance with such plan for  their employment by such employer as drivers or drivers' helpers making  local deliveries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any finding made as to the purpose and effect of such a wage  payment plan pursuant to a petition therefor will be based upon a  consideration of all relevant facts shown or represented to exist with  respect to such plan that are made available to the Administrator. A  finding that such plan has the general effect of reducing the hours  worked by drivers or drivers' helpers compensated thereunder to, or  below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under section 7(a) of the  Act is not authorized under this part unless the Administrator finds  that during the most recently completed representative period of one  year (based on the experience of the employer in question, or if such  employer has not previously used such plan, on the experience of another  employer using such plan under substantially the same conditions, all as  defined in Sec. 551.8(g)(1)), the average weekly hours, taken in the  aggregate, of all full-time employees covered by the plan are not in  excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employees under  section 7(a), or unless the Administrator makes an interim finding with  respect to such plan that, notwithstanding a lack of experience under it  for a representative period of 1 year, its provisions and manner of  operation, together with the other available information concerning the  plan, indicate clearly that by the end of such first representative year  the effect of the plan will have been to reduce the average weekly hours  worked by the employees covered by the plan in such first year of  operation to, or below, such maximum applicable workweek.</p>
