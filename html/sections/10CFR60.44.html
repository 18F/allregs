Records of tests and experiments carried out pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall also be maintained. These records shall include a written safety evaluation which provides the basis for the determination that the change, test, or experiment does not involve an unreviewed safety question. The DOE shall prepare annually, or at such shorter intervals as may be specified in the license, a report containing a brief description of such changes, tests, and experiments, including a summary of the safety evaluation of each. The DOE shall furnish the report to the appropriate NRC Regional Office shown in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by an appropriate method listed in Sec. 60.4(a), with a copy to the Director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. Any report submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be made a part of the public record of the licensing proceedings.
