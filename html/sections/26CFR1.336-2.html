                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Availability of election. A section 336(e) election is available  if seller or S   corporation shareholder(s) dispose of stock of another corporation  (target) in a qualified stock disposition (as defined in Sec. 1.336- 1(b)(6)). A section 336(e) election is irrevocable. A section 336(e)  election is not available for transactions described in section 336(e)  that do not constitute qualified stock dispositions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deemed transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dispositions not described in section  355(d)(2) or (e)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Old target--deemed asset disposition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. This paragraph (b)(1) provides the Federal income tax  consequences of a section 336(e) election made with respect to a  qualified stock disposition not described, in whole or in part, in  section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). For the Federal income tax consequences of  a section 336(e) election made with respect to a qualified stock  disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or  (e)(2), see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In general, if a section  336(e) election is made, seller (or S corporation shareholders) are  treated as not having sold, exchanged, or distributed the stock disposed  of in the qualified stock disposition. Instead, old target is treated as  selling its assets to an unrelated person in a single transaction at the  close of the disposition date (but before the deemed liquidation  described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) in exchange for the  aggregate deemed asset disposition price (ADADP) as determined under  Sec. 1.336-3. ADADP is allocated among the disposition date assets in  the same manner as the aggregate deemed sale price (ADSP) is allocated  under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the amount  realized from each of the sold assets. Old target realizes the deemed  disposition tax consequences from the deemed asset disposition before  the close of the disposition date while old target is owned by seller or  the S corporation shareholders. If old target is an S corporation  target, old target's S election continues in effect through the close of  the disposition date (including the time of the deemed asset disposition  and the deemed liquidation) notwithstanding section 1362(d)(2)(B). Also,  if old target is an S corporation target (but not a qualified subchapter  S subsidiary), any direct or indirect subsidiaries of old target that  old target has elected to treat as qualified subchapter S subsidiaries  under section 1361(b)(3) remain qualified subchapter S subsidiaries  through the close of the disposition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gains and losses--(1) Gains. Except as provided in Sec.  1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8) (regarding the installment method), old target  shall recognize all of the gains realized on the deemed asset  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Losses--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs  (b)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)(2)(ii)</em>, (iii), and (iv) of this section, old target shall  recognize all of the losses realized on the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stock distributions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A)  and (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, for purposes of determining the  amount of target's losses that are disallowed on the deemed asset  disposition, seller is still treated as selling, exchanging, or  distributing its target stock disposed of in the 12-month disposition  period. If target's losses realized on the deemed sale of all of its  assets exceed target's gains realized (a net loss), the portion of such  net loss attributable to a distribution of target stock during the 12- month disposition period is disallowed. The total amount of disallowed  loss and the allocation of disallowed loss is determined in the manner  provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount and allocation of disallowed loss. The total disallowed  loss pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section shall be  determined by multiplying the net loss realized on the deemed asset  disposition by the disallowed loss fraction. The numerator of the  disallowed loss fraction is the value of target stock, determined on the  disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition  period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition (for  example, stock distributed to a related person), and the denominator of  the disallowed loss fraction is the sum of the value of target stock,  determined on the disposition date, disposed of by sale or exchange in  the qualified stock disposition during the 12-month disposition period  and the value of target stock,   determined on the disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12- month disposition period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock  disposition. The amount of the disallowed loss allocated to each asset  disposed of in the deemed asset disposition is determined by multiplying  the total amount of the disallowed loss by the loss allocation fraction.  The numerator of the loss allocation fraction is the amount of loss  realized with respect to the asset and the denominator of the loss  allocation fraction is the sum of the amount of losses realized with  respect to each loss asset disposed of in the deemed asset disposition.  To the extent old target's losses from the deemed asset disposition are  not disallowed under this paragraph, such losses may be disallowed under  other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or general principles of  tax law, in the same manner as if such assets were actually sold to an  unrelated person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tiered targets. If an asset of target is the stock of a  subsidiary corporation of target for which a section 336(e) election is  made, any gain or loss realized on the deemed sale of the stock of the  subsidiary corporation is disregarded in determining the amount of  disallowed loss. For purposes of determining the amount of disallowed  loss on the deemed asset disposition by a subsidiary of target for which  a section 336(e) election is made, the amount of subsidiary stock deemed  sold in the deemed asset disposition of target's assets multiplied by  the disallowed loss fraction with respect to the corporation that is  deemed to have disposed of stock of the subsidiary is considered to have  been distributed. In determining the disallowed loss fraction with  respect to the deemed asset disposition of any subsidiary of target,  disregard any sale, exchange, or distribution of its stock that was made  after the disposition date if such stock was included in the deemed  asset disposition of the corporation deemed to have disposed of the  subsidiary stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Parent owns 60 of the 100 outstanding shares  of the common stock of Seller, Seller's only class of stock outstanding.  The remaining 40 shares of the common stock of Seller are held by  shareholders unrelated to Seller or each other. Seller owns 95 of the  100 outstanding shares of Target common stock, and all 100 shares of  Target preferred stock that is described in section 1504(a)(4). The  remaining 5 shares of Target common stock are owned by A. On January 1  of Year 1, Seller sells 72 shares of Target common stock to B for  $3,520. On July 1 of Year 1, Seller distributes 12 shares of Target  common stock to Parent and 8 shares to its unrelated shareholders in a  distribution described in section 301. Seller retains 3 shares of Target  common stock and all 100 shares of Target preferred stock immediately  after July 1. The value of Target common stock on July 1 is $60 per  share. The value of Target preferred stock on July 1 is $36 per share.  Target has three assets, Asset 1, a Class IV asset, with a basis of  $1,776 and a fair market value of $2,000, Asset 2, a Class V asset, with  a basis of $2,600 and a fair market value of $2,750, and Asset 3, a  Class V asset, with a basis of $3,900 and a fair market value of $3,850.  Seller incurred no selling costs on the sale of the 72 shares of Target  common stock to B. Target has no liabilities. A section 336(e) election  is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences--Deemed Asset Sale. Because at least 80 percent  ((72 + 8)/100) of Target stock, other than stock described in section  1504(a)(4), was disposed of (within the meaning of Sec. 1.336-1(b)(5))  by Seller during the 12-month disposition period, a qualified stock  disposition occurred. July 1 of Year 1, the first day on which there was  a qualified stock disposition with respect to Target stock, is the  disposition date. Accordingly, pursuant to the section 336(e) election,  for Federal income tax purposes, Seller generally is not treated as  selling the 72 shares of Target common stock sold to B or distributing  the 8 shares of Target common stock distributed to its unrelated  shareholders. However, Seller is still treated as distributing the 12  shares of Target common stock distributed to Parent because Seller and  Parent are related persons within the meaning of Sec. 1.336-1(b)(12)  and accordingly the 12 shares are not part of the qualified stock  disposition. Target is treated as if, on July 1, it sold all of its  assets to an unrelated person in exchange for the ADADP, $8,000, which  is allocated $2,000 to Asset 1, $2,500 to Asset 2, and $3,500 to Asset 3  (see Example 1 of Sec. 1.336-3(g) for the determination and allocation  of ADADP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consequences--Amount and Allocation of Disallowed Loss. Old  Target realized a net loss of $276 on the deemed asset disposition ($224  gain realized on Asset 1, $100 loss realized on Asset 2, and $400 loss  realized on Asset 3). However, 20 shares of Target common stock were  distributed by Seller during the 12-month disposition period (8 shares  distributed to Seller's unrelated shareholders in the qualified stock  disposition plus 12 shares   distributed to Parent that were not part of the qualified stock  disposition). Therefore, because there was a net loss realized on the  deemed asset disposition and a portion of the stock of Target was  distributed during the 12-month disposition period, a portion of the  loss on the deemed sale of each of Target's loss assets is disallowed.  The total amount of disallowed loss equals $60 ($276 net loss realized  on the deemed disposition of Assets 1, 2, and 3 multiplied by the  disallowed loss fraction, the numerator of which is $1,200, the value on  July 1, the disposition date, of the 20 shares of Target common stock  distributed during the 12-month disposition period, and the denominator  of which is $5,520, the sum of $4,320, the value on July 1 of the 72  shares of Target common stock sold to B and $1,200, the value on July 1  of the 20 shares of Target common stock distributed during the 12-month  disposition period). The portion of the disallowed loss allocated to  Asset 2 is $12 ($60 total disallowed loss multiplied by the loss  allocation fraction, the numerator of which is $100, the loss realized  on the deemed disposition of Asset 2 and the denominator of which is  $500, the sum of the losses realized on the deemed disposition of Assets  2 and 3). The portion of the disallowed loss allocated to Asset 3 is $48  ($60 total disallowed loss multiplied by the loss allocation fraction,  the numerator of which is $400, the loss realized on the deemed  disposition of Asset 3 and the denominator of which is $500, the sum of  the losses realized on the deemed disposition of Assets 2 and 3).  Accordingly, Old Target recognizes $224 of gain on Asset 1, recognizes  $88 of loss on Asset 2 (realized loss of $100 less allocated disallowed  loss of $12), and recognizes $352 of loss on Asset 3 (realized loss of  $400 less allocated disallowed loss of $48) or a recognized net loss of  $216 on the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except  that Asset 2 is the stock of Target Subsidiary, a corporation of which  Target owns 100 of the 110 shares of common stock, the only outstanding  class of Target Subsidiary stock. The remaining 10 shares of Target  Subsidiary stock are owned by D. The value of Target Subsidiary stock on  July 1 is $27.50 per share. Target Subsidiary has two assets, Asset 4, a  Class IV asset, with a basis of $800 and a fair market value of $1,000,  and Asset 5, a Class IV asset, with a basis of $2,200 and a fair market  value of $2,025. Target Subsidiary has no liabilities. A section 336(e)  election with respect to Target Subsidiary is also made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences--Target. The ADADP on the deemed sale of Target's  assets is determined and allocated in the same manner as in Example 1.  However, Target's loss realized on the deemed sale of Target Subsidiary  is disregarded in determining the amount of disallowed loss on the  deemed asset disposition of Target's assets. Thus, the net loss is only  $176 ($224 gain realized on Asset 1 and $400 loss realized on Asset 3),  and the amount of disallowed loss equals $38.26 ($176 net loss  multiplied by the disallowed loss fraction with respect to Target stock,  $1,200/$5,520). The entire disallowed loss is allocated to Asset 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consequences--Target Subsidiary. The deemed sale of the stock  of Target Subsidiary is disregarded and instead Target Subsidiary is  deemed to sell all of its assets to an unrelated person. The ADADP on  the deemed asset disposition of Target Subsidiary is $2,750, which is  allocated $909 to Asset 4 and $1,841 to Asset 5 (see Example 2 of Sec.  1.336-3(g) for the determination and allocation of ADADP). Old Target  Subsidiary realized $109 of gain on Asset 4 and realized $359 of loss on  Asset 5 in the deemed asset disposition. Although Old Target Subsidiary  realized a net loss of $250 on the deemed asset disposition ($109 gain  on Asset 4 and $359 loss on Asset 5), a portion of this net loss is  disallowed because a portion of Target stock was distributed during the  12-month disposition period. For purposes of determining the amount of  disallowed loss on the deemed sale of the assets of Target Subsidiary,  the portion of the 100 shares of Target Subsidiary stock deemed sold by  Target pursuant to the section 336(e) election for Target Subsidiary  multiplied by the disallowed loss fraction with respect to Target stock  is treated as having been distributed. Thus, for purposes of determining  the amount of disallowed loss on the deemed asset disposition of Target  Subsidiary's assets, 21.74 shares of Target Subsidiary stock (100 shares  of Target Subsidiary stock owned by Target multiplied by the disallowed  loss fraction with respect to Target stock, $1,200/$5,520) are treated  as having been distributed by Target during the 12-month disposition  period. The total amount of disallowed loss with respect to the deemed  asset disposition of Target Subsidiary's assets equals $54 ($250 net  loss realized on the deemed disposition of Assets 4 and 5 multiplied by  the disallowed loss fraction with respect to Target Subsidiary, the  numerator of which is $598, the value on July 1, the disposition date,  of the 21.74 shares of Target Subsidiary stock deemed distributed during  the 12-month disposition period (21.74 shares x $27.50) and the  denominator of which is $2,750 (the sum of $2,152, the value on July 1  of the 78.26 shares of Target Subsidiary stock deemed sold in the  qualified stock disposition pursuant to the section 336(e) election for  Target Subsidiary (78.26 shares x $27.50) and $598, the value on July 1  of the 21.74 shares of Target Subsidiary stock deemed distributed during  the 12-month disposition period)). (The 10 shares of Target Subsidiary  owned by D are not part of the qualified stock disposition and therefore  are not included in the denominator of the disallowed loss fraction.)  All of the disallowed   loss is allocated to Asset 5, the only loss asset. Accordingly, Old  Target Subsidiary recognizes $109 of gain on Asset 4 and recognizes $305  of loss on Asset 5 (realized loss of $359 less disallowed loss of $54)  or a net loss of $196 on the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except  that on August 1 of Year 1, Target sells 50 of its shares of Target  Subsidiary stock and distributes the remaining 50 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Because the 100 shares of Target Subsidiary stock  that were sold and distributed on August 1 were deemed disposed of on  July 1 in the deemed asset disposition of Target, the August 1 sale and  distribution of Target Subsidiary stock are disregarded in determining  the amount of disallowed loss. Accordingly, the consequences are the  same as in Example 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed asset  disposition of a higher-tier subsidiary is considered to precede the  deemed asset disposition of a lower-subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New target--deemed purchase. New target is treated as acquiring  all of its assets from an unrelated person in a single transaction at  the close of the disposition date (but before the deemed liquidation) in  exchange for an amount equal to the adjusted grossed-up basis (AGUB) as  determined under Sec. 1.336-4. New target allocates the consideration  deemed paid in the transaction in the same manner as new target would  under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the basis in  each of the purchased assets. If new target qualifies as a small  business corporation within the meaning of section 1361(b) and wants to  be an S corporation, a new election under section 1362(a) must be made.  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (deemed  liquidation of old target), new target remains liable for the tax  liabilities of old target (including the tax liability for the deemed  disposition tax consequences). For example, new target remains liable  for the tax liabilities of the members of any consolidated group that  are attributable to taxable years in which those corporations and old  target joined in the same consolidated return. See Sec. 1.1502-6(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Old target and seller--deemed liquidation--(A) In general. If  old target is an S corporation, S corporation shareholders (whether or  not they sell or exchange their stock) take their pro rata share of the  deemed disposition tax consequences into account under section 1366 and  increase or decrease their basis in target stock under section 1367. Old  target and seller (or S corporation shareholders) are treated as if,  before the close of the disposition date, after the deemed asset  disposition described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section, and  while target is owned by seller or S corporation shareholders, old  target transferred all of the consideration deemed received from new  target in the deemed asset disposition to seller or S corporation  shareholders, any S corporation election for old target terminated, and  old target ceased to exist. The transfer from old target to seller or S  corporation shareholders is characterized for Federal income tax  purposes in the same manner as if the parties had actually engaged in  the transactions deemed to occur because of this section and taking into  account other transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to  occur. For example, the transfer may be treated as a distribution in  pursuance of a plan of reorganization, a distribution in complete  cancellation or redemption of all of its stock, one of a series of  distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock  in accordance with a plan of liquidation, or part of a circular flow of  cash. In most cases, the transfer will be treated as a distribution in  complete liquidation to which sections 331 or 332 and sections 336 or  337 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed liquidation of  a lower-tier subsidiary corporation is considered to precede the deemed  liquidation of a higher-tier subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Seller--distribution of target stock. In the case of a  distribution of target stock in a qualified stock disposition, seller  (the distributor) is deemed to purchase from an unrelated person, on the  disposition date, immediately after the deemed liquidation of old  target, the amount of stock distributed in the qualified stock  disposition (new target stock) and to have distributed such new target  stock to its shareholders.   Seller recognizes no gain or loss on the distribution of such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, the fair market value of all of  the target stock equals the grossed-up amount realized on the sale,  exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of target (see  Sec. 1.336-3(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Old  target--deemed asset disposition--(A) In general. This paragraph (b)(2)  provides the Federal income tax consequences of a section 336(e)  election made with respect to a qualified stock disposition resulting,  in whole or in part, from a disposition described in section 355(d)(2)  or (e)(2). Old target is treated as selling its assets to an unrelated  person in a single transaction at the close of the disposition date in  exchange for the ADADP as determined under Sec. 1.336-3. ADADP is  allocated among the disposition date assets in the same manner as ADSP  is allocated under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine  the amount realized from each of the sold assets. Old target realizes  the deemed disposition tax consequences from the deemed asset  disposition before the close of the disposition date while old target is  owned by seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Old target not deemed to liquidate. In general, unlike a section  338(h)(10) election or a section 336(e) election made with respect to a  qualified stock disposition not described, in whole or in part, in  section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), old target is not deemed to liquidate after  the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. If an election is made under Sec. 1.1502- 13(f)(5)(ii)(E), then solely for purposes of Sec. 1.1502- 13(f)(5)(ii)(C), immediately after the deemed asset disposition of old  target, old target is deemed to liquidate into seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gains and losses--(1) Gains. Except as provided in Sec.  1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8) (regarding the installment method), old target  shall recognize all of the gains realized on the deemed asset  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)(2)(ii)</em>, (iii), and (iv) of this section, old target shall  recognize all of the losses realized on the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stock distributions. If target's losses realized on the deemed  sale of all of its assets exceed target's gains realized (a net loss),  the portion of such net loss attributable to a distribution of target  stock during the 12-month disposition period is disallowed. The total  amount of disallowed loss and the allocation of disallowed loss is  determined in the manner provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B)(2)(iii) and  (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount and allocation of disallowed loss. The total disallowed  loss pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(2)(ii) of this section shall be  determined by multiplying the net loss realized on the deemed asset  disposition by the disallowed loss fraction. The numerator of the  disallowed loss fraction is the value of target stock, determined on the  disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition  period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition (for  example, stock distributed to a related person), and the denominator of  the disallowed loss fraction is the sum of the value of target stock,  determined on the disposition date, disposed of by sale or exchange in  the qualified stock disposition during the 12-month disposition period  and the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date,  distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition period, whether or  not a part of the qualified stock disposition. The amount of the  disallowed loss allocated to each asset disposed of in the deemed asset  disposition is determined by multiplying the total amount of the  disallowed loss by the loss allocation fraction. The numerator of the  loss allocation fraction is the amount of loss realized with respect to  the asset and the denominator of the loss allocation fraction is the sum  of the amount of losses realized with respect to each loss asset  disposed of in the deemed asset disposition. To the extent old target's   losses from the deemed asset disposition are not disallowed under this  paragraph, such losses may be disallowed under other provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code or general principles of tax law, in the same  manner as if such assets were actually sold to an unrelated person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tiered targets. If an asset of target is the stock of a  subsidiary corporation of target for which a section 336(e) election is  made, any gain or loss realized on the deemed sale of the stock of the  subsidiary corporation is disregarded in determining the amount of  disallowed loss. For purposes of determining the amount of disallowed  loss on the deemed asset disposition by a subsidiary of target for which  a section 336(e) election is made, see paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph  (b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Seller owns 90 of the 100 outstanding shares  of Target common stock, the only class of Target stock outstanding. The  remaining 10 shares of Target common stock are owned by C. On January 1  of Year 1, Seller sells 10 shares of Target common stock to D for $910.  On July 1, in an unrelated transaction, Seller distributes its remaining  80 shares of Target common stock to its unrelated shareholders in a  distribution described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). On July 1, the  value of Target common stock is $100 per share. Target has three assets,  Asset 1 with a basis of $1,220, Asset 2 with a basis of $3,675, and  Asset 3 with a basis of $5,725. Seller incurred no selling costs on the  sale of the 10 shares of Target common stock to D. Target has no  liabilities. A section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Because at least 80 percent of Target stock ((10  + 80)/100) was disposed of (within the meaning of Sec. 1.336-1(b)(5))  by Seller during the 12-month disposition period, a qualified stock  disposition occurred. July 1 of Year 1, the first day on which there was  a qualified stock disposition with respect to Target, is the disposition  date. Accordingly, pursuant to the section 336(e) election, for Federal  income tax purposes, Target is treated as if, on July 1, it sold all of  its assets to an unrelated person in exchange for the ADADP, $9,900, as  determined under Sec. 1.336-3. Assume that the ADADP is allocated  $2,000 to Asset 1, $3,300 to Asset 2, and $4,600 to Asset 3 under Sec.  1.336-3. Old Target realized a net loss of $720 on the deemed asset  disposition ($780 gain realized on Asset 1, $375 loss realized on Asset  2, and $1,125 loss realized on Asset 3). However, because a portion of  Target stock was distributed during the 12-month disposition period and  there was a net loss on the deemed asset disposition, a portion of the  loss on each of the loss assets is disallowed. The total amount of  disallowed loss equals $640 ($720 net loss realized on the deemed  disposition of Assets 1, 2, and 3 multiplied by the disallowed loss  fraction, the numerator of which is $8,000, the value on July 1, the  disposition date, of the 80 shares of Target common stock distributed by  Seller during the 12-month disposition period, and the denominator of  which is $9,000, the sum of $1,000, the value on July 1 of the 10 shares  of Target common stock sold to D, and $8,000, the value on July 1 of the  80 shares of Target common stock distributed by Seller during the 12- month disposition period). The portion of the disallowed loss allocated  to Asset 2 is $160 ($640 total disallowed loss on the deemed asset  disposition multiplied by the loss allocation fraction, the numerator of  which is $375, the loss realized on the deemed disposition of Asset 2,  and the denominator of which is $1,500, the sum of the losses realized  on the deemed disposition of Assets 2 and 3). The portion of the  disallowed loss allocated to Asset 3 is $480 ($640 total disallowed loss  on the deemed asset disposition multiplied by the loss allocation  fraction, the numerator of which is $1,125, the loss realized on the  deemed disposition of Asset 3, and the denominator of which is $1,500,  the sum of the losses realized on the deemed disposition of Assets 2 and  3). Accordingly, Old Target recognizes $780 of gain on Asset 1,  recognizes $215 of loss on Asset 2 (realized loss of $375 less allocated  disallowed loss of $160), and recognizes $645 of loss on Asset 3  (realized loss of $1,125 less allocated disallowed loss of $480) or a  recognized net loss of $80 on the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except  that Asset 2 is 100 shares of common stock of Target Subsidiary, a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Target. The value of Target Subsidiary common  stock on July 1 is $40 per share. Target Subsidiary has two assets,  Asset 4 with a basis of $500 and Asset 5 with a basis of $3,000. Target  Subsidiary has no liabilities. A section 336(e) election is also made  with respect to Target Subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences--Target. The ADADP on the deemed sale of Target's  assets is determined and allocated in the same manner as in Example 1.  However, Old Target's loss realized on the deemed sale of Target  Subsidiary is disregarded in determining the amount of the disallowed  loss on the deemed asset disposition of Old Target's assets. Thus, the  realized net loss is only $345 ($780 gain on Asset 1 and $1,125 loss on  Asset 3), and the amount of disallowed loss equals $307, the $345  realized net loss multiplied by the disallowed loss fraction with  respect to Target stock,   $8,000/$9,000. The entire disallowed loss is allocated to Asset 3.  Accordingly, Old Target recognizes $780 of gain on Asset 1 and  recognizes $818 of loss on Asset 3 (realized loss of $1,125 less  allocated disallowed loss of $307) or a recognized net loss of $38 on  the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consequences--Target Subsidiary. Because the deemed sale of  Target Subsidiary is not a transaction described in section 355(d)(2) or  (e)(2), the tax consequences of the deemed sale of Target Subsidiary are  determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and not this paragraph  (b)(2). The deemed sale of the stock of Target Subsidiary is disregarded  and instead Target Subsidiary is deemed to sell all of its assets to an  unrelated person. The ADADP on the deemed asset disposition of Target  Subsidiary as determined under Sec. 1.336-3 is $3,300. Assume that the  ADADP is allocated $900 to Asset 4 and $2,400 to Asset 5 under Sec.  1.336-3. Old Target Subsidiary realized a net loss of $200 on the deemed  asset disposition ($400 gain realized on Asset 4 and $600 loss realized  on Asset 5). However, because a portion of Target stock was distributed  during the 12-month disposition period, for purposes of determining the  amount of disallowed loss on the deemed sale of the assets of Target  Subsidiary, the portion of the 100 shares of Target Subsidiary stock  deemed sold pursuant to the section 336(e) election for Target  Subsidiary multiplied by the disallowed loss fraction with respect to  Target stock are treated as having been distributed. Thus, for purposes  of determining the amount of disallowed loss on the deemed asset  disposition of Target Subsidiary's assets, 88.89 shares of Target  Subsidiary common stock (100 shares owned by Target multiplied by the  disallowed loss fraction with respect to Target stock, $8,000/$9,000)  are treated as distributed during the 12-month disposition period. The  total amount of disallowed loss with respect to the deemed asset  disposition of Target Subsidiary's assets equals $177.78 ($200 net loss  realized on the deemed disposition of Assets 4 and 5 multiplied by the  disallowed loss fraction with respect to Target Subsidiary, the  numerator of which is $3,556, the value on July 1, the disposition date,  of the 88.89 shares of Target Subsidiary common stock deemed distributed  during the 12-month disposition period (88.89 shares x $40) and the  denominator of which is $4,000 (the sum of $444, the value on July 1 of  the 11.11 shares of Target Subsidiary common stock deemed sold in the  qualified stock disposition pursuant to the section 336(e) election for  Target Subsidiary (11.11 shares x $40) and $3,556, the value on July 1  of the 88.89 shares of Target Subsidiary common stock deemed distributed  during the 12-month disposition period)). All of the disallowed loss is  allocated to Asset 5, the only loss asset. Accordingly, Old Target  Subsidiary recognizes $400 of gain on Asset 4 and recognizes $422.22 of  loss on Asset 5 (realized loss of $600 less allocated disallowed loss of  $177.78) or a recognized net loss of $22.22 on the deemed asset  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed asset  disposition of a higher-tier subsidiary is considered to precede the  deemed asset disposition of a lower-tier subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Old target--deemed purchase--(A) In general. Immediately after  the deemed asset disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this  section, old target is treated as acquiring all of its assets from an  unrelated person in a single, separate transaction at the close of the  disposition date (but before the distribution described in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section) in exchange for an amount equal to the  AGUB as determined under Sec. 1.336-4. Old target allocates the  consideration deemed paid in the transaction in the same manner as new  target would under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine  the basis in each of the purchased assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections with respect to a qualified  stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2)  or (e)(2), old target's deemed purchase of all its assets is considered  to precede the deemed asset disposition of a lower-tier subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Application of section 197(f)(9), section 1091, and other  provisions to old target. Solely for purposes of section 197(f)(9),  section 1091, and any other provision designated in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of  this chapter), old target, in its capacity as seller of assets in the  deemed asset disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this  section, shall be treated as a separate and distinct taxpayer from, and  unrelated to, old target in its capacity as acquirer of assets in the  deemed purchase described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and  for subsequent periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Seller--distribution of target stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Immediately after old target's deemed purchase of its assets described  in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of   this section, seller is treated as distributing the stock of old target  actually distributed to its shareholders in the qualified stock  disposition. No gain or loss is recognized by seller on the  distribution. Additionally, if stock of target is sold, exchanged, or  distributed outside of the section 355 transaction but still as part of  a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section  355(d)(2) or (e)(2), no gain or loss is recognized by seller on such  sale, exchange, or distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections with respect to a qualified  stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2)  or (e)(2), the Federal income tax consequences of the section 336(e)  election for a subsidiary of target shall be determined under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section unless the stock of the subsidiary of target is  actually disposed of in a qualified stock disposition described, in  whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). The deemed liquidation  of a lower-tier subsidiary pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this  section is considered to precede the deemed liquidation of a higher-tier  subsidiary. The deemed liquidation of the highest tier subsidiary of  target is considered to precede the distribution of old target stock  described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the fair market value of all of  the target stock equals the grossed-up amount realized on the sale,  exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of target (see  Sec. 1.336-3(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Qualification under section 355. Old target's deemed sale of all  its assets to an unrelated person and old target's deemed purchase of  all its assets from an unrelated person will not cause the distribution  of old target to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 355.  Similarly, any deemed transactions under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of  this section that a subsidiary of target is treated as engaging in will  not cause the distribution of old target to fail to satisfy the  requirements of section 355. For purposes of applying section  355(a)(1)(D), seller is treated as having disposed of any stock disposed  of in the qualified stock disposition on the date seller actually sold,  exchanged, or distributed such stock. Further, seller's deemed  disposition of retained old target stock under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of  this section is disregarded for purposes of applying section  355(a)(1)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Earnings and profits. The earnings and profits of seller and  target shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 1.312-10 and, if  applicable, Sec. 1.1502-33(e). For this purpose, target will not be  treated as a newly created controlled corporation and any increase or  decrease in target's earnings and profits pursuant to the deemed asset  disposition will increase or decrease, as the case may be, target's  earnings and profits immediately before the allocation described in  Sec. 1.312-10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minority shareholders--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (d)  describes the treatment of shareholders of old target other than seller,  a member of seller's consolidated group, and S corporation shareholders  (whether or not they sell or exchange their stock of target). A  shareholder to which this paragraph (d) applies is referred to as a  minority shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sale, exchange, or distribution of target stock by a minority  shareholder. A minority shareholder recognizes gain or loss (as  permitted under the general principles of tax law) on its sale,  exchange, or distribution of target stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Retention of target stock by a minority shareholder. A minority  shareholder who retains its target stock does not recognize gain or loss  under this section with respect to its shares of target stock. The  minority shareholder's basis and holding period for that target stock  are not affected by the section 336(e) election. Notwithstanding this  treatment of the minority shareholder, if a section 336(e) election is  made, target will still be treated as disposing of all of its assets in  the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Treatment consistent with an actual asset disposition. Except as  otherwise provided, no provision in this section shall produce a Federal  income tax result under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code that  would not occur if the parties had actually engaged in the transactions  deemed to occur because of this section, taking into account other  transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to occur. See Sec.  1.338-1(a)(2) regarding the application of other rules of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of target under other provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code. The provisions Sec. 1.338-1(b) apply with respect to the  treatment of new target after a section 336(e) election, treating any  reference to section 338 or 338(h)(10) as a reference to section 336(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Target as two corporations. Although target  is a single corporation under corporate law, if a section 336(e)  election is made, then, except with respect to a distribution described  in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2) and as provided in Sec. 1.338-1(b)(2),  two separate corporations, old target and new target, generally are  considered to exist for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue  Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of members of a consolidated group. For purposes of  Sec. Sec. 1.336-1 through 1.336-5, all members of seller's consolidated  group are treated as a single seller, regardless of which member or  members actually dispose of any stock. Accordingly, any dispositions of  stock made by members of the same consolidated group shall be treated as  made by one corporation, and any stock owned by members of the same  consolidated group and not disposed of will be treated as stock retained  by seller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> International provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Source and foreign tax credit. The  principles of section 338(h)(16) apply to section 336(e) elections for  targets with foreign operations to ensure that the source and foreign  tax credit limitation are properly determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of foreign taxes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Except as  provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, if a section 336(e)  election is made for target and target's taxable year under foreign law  (if any) does not close at the end of the disposition date, foreign tax  paid or accrued by new target with respect to such foreign taxable year  is allocated between old target and new target. If there is more than  one section 336(e) election with respect to target during target's  foreign taxable year, foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to that  foreign taxable year is allocated among all old targets and new targets.  The allocation is made based on the respective portions of the taxable  income (as determined under foreign law) for the foreign taxable year  that are attributable under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b) to the  period of existence of each old target and new target during the foreign  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxes imposed on partnerships and disregarded entities. If a  section 336(e) election is made for target and target holds an interest  in a disregarded entity or partnership, the rules of Sec. 1.901-   2(f)(4) apply to determine the person who is considered for U.S. Federal  income tax purposes to pay foreign tax imposed at the entity level on  the income of the disregarded entity or partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disallowance of foreign tax credits under section 901(m). For  rules that may apply to disallow foreign tax credits with respect to  income not subject to United States taxation by reason of a covered  asset acquisition, see section 901(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Making the section 336(e) election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consolidated group. If  seller(s) and target are members of the same consolidated group, a  section 336(e) election is made by completing the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seller(s) and target must enter into a written, binding  agreement, on or before the due date (including extensions) of the  consolidated group's consolidated Federal income tax return for the  taxable year that includes the disposition date, to make a section  336(e) election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The common parent of the consolidated group must retain a copy  of the written agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The common parent of the consolidated group must attach the  section 336(e) election statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and  (6) of this section, to the group's timely filed (including extensions)  consolidated Federal income tax return for the taxable year that  includes the disposition date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The common parent of the consolidated group must provide a copy  of the section 336(e) election statement to target on or before the due  date (including extensions) of the consolidated group's consolidated  Federal income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-consolidated/non-S corporation target. If target is neither  a member of the same consolidated group as seller nor an S corporation,  a section 336(e) election is made by completing the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seller and target must enter into a written, binding agreement,  on or before the due date (including extensions) of seller's or target's  Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the  disposition date, whichever is earlier, to make a section 336(e)  election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Seller and target each must retain a copy of the written  agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Seller and target each must attach the section 336(e) election  statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, to  its timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for  the taxable year that includes the disposition date. However, seller's  section 336(e) election statement may disregard paragraph (h)(6)(xii) of  this section (concerning a gain recognition election).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> S corporation target. A section 336(e) election for an S  corporation target is made by completing the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of the S corporation shareholders, including those who do  not dispose of any stock in the qualified stock disposition, and the S  corporation target must enter into a written, binding agreement, on or  before the due date (including extensions) of the Federal income tax  return of the S corporation target for the taxable year that includes  the disposition date, to make a section 336(e) election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S corporation target must retain a copy of the written  agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S corporation target must attach the section 336(e) election  statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, to  its timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for  the taxable year that includes the disposition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making section 336(e) elections, in order to make a section  336(e) election for a lower-tier target (target subsidiary), the  requirements described in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2), of this section,  whichever is applicable to the qualified stock disposition of target  subsidiary, must be satisfied. The written agreement described in  paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section for the section 336(e)  election with respect to target subsidiary may be either a separate  written agreement between target subsidiary and the corporation deemed   to dispose of the stock of target subsidiary or may be included in the  written agreement between seller(s) (or the S corporation shareholders)  and target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 336(e) election statement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The section 336(e) election statement must  include the information described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.  The relevant information for each S corporation shareholder and,  notwithstanding paragraph (g)(2) of this section, each consolidated  group member that disposes of or retains target stock must be set forth  individually, not in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Target subsidiaries. In the case of a section 336(e) election  for a target subsidiary, a separate statement must be filed for each  target subsidiary. In preparing the section 336(e) election statement  with respect to a target subsidiary, any reference to seller in  paragraph (h)(6) of this section should be considered a reference to the  corporation deemed to dispose of the stock of the target subsidiary and  any reference to target in paragraphs (h)(5)(i) and (h)(6) of this  section should be considered a reference to the target subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Contents of section 336(e) election statement.

In addition, in the case of a section 336(e)  election as the result of a transaction described in section 355(d)(2)  or (e)(2), old target should file two Forms 8883, (or successor forms),  one in its capacity as the seller of the assets in the deemed asset  disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and one in  its capacity as the purchaser of the assets in the deemed purchase  described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Seller owns all of the stock of Target and  Target owns all of the stock of Target Subsidiary. Seller is the common  parent of a consolidated group that includes Target. However, Target  Subsidiary is not included in the consolidated group pursuant to section  1504(a)(3). On Date 1, Seller sells 80 percent of its Target stock to A  and distributes the remaining 20 percent of Target stock to Seller's  unrelated shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Making of election for Target. Because Seller and Target are  members of a consolidated group, in order to make a section 336(e)  election for the qualified stock disposition of Target, the requirements  of paragraph (h)(1) of this section must be satisfied. On or before the  due date of Seller group's consolidated Federal income tax return that  includes Date 1, Seller and Target must enter into a written, binding  agreement to make a section 336(e) election; Seller must retain a copy  of the written agreement; Seller must attach the section 336(e) election  statement to the group's timely filed consolidated return for the  taxable year that includes Date 1, and Seller must provide a copy of the  section 336(e) election statement to Target on or before the due date  (including extensions) of the consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of the statement should include  the relevant information for Target Subsidiary, paragraphs (vii) through  (xi) of the statement should provide information for both Seller's  actual sale and distribution of Target stock as well as information for  Target's deemed sale of Target Subsidiary stock, and paragraph (xiii) of  the statement should include a statement that Seller, Target, and Target  Subsidiary, or Target and Target Subsidiary, whichever is appropriate,  have executed a written, binding agreement to make a section 336(e)  election with respect to the qualified stock disposition of Target  Subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A and B each own 45 percent and C owns the  remaining 10 percent of the stock of S Corporation Target, an S  corporation. S Corporation Target owns 80 percent of the stock of Target  Subsidiary and D owns the remaining 20 percent. On Date 1, A and B each  sell all of their S Corporation Target stock to an unrelated individual.  C retains his 10 percent of the stock of S Corporation Target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Making of election for S Corporation Target. Because S  Corporation Target is an S Corporation Target, in order to make a  section 336(e) election for the qualified stock disposition of S  Corporation Target, the requirements of paragraph (h)(3) of this section  must be satisfied. On or before the due date of S Corporation Target's  Federal income tax return that includes Date 1, A, B, C, and S  Corporation Target must enter into a written, binding agreement to make  a section 336(e) election; S Corporation Target must retain a copy of  the written agreement; and S Corporation Target must attach the section  336(e) election statement to its timely filed Federal income tax return  for the taxable year that includes Date 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of the statement should include the relevant  information for Target Subsidiary, paragraphs (vii) through (xi) of the  statement should provide information for both A's and B's actual sale  and C's actual retention of S Corporation Target stock as well as  information for S Corporation Target's deemed sale of Target Subsidiary  stock, and paragraph (xiii) of the statement should include a statement  that A, B, C, S Corporation Target, and Target Subsidiary, or S  Corporation Target and Target Subsidiary, whichever is appropriate, have  executed a written, binding agreement to make a section 336(e) election  with respect to the qualified stock disposition of Target Subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Protective section 336(e) election. Taxpayers may make a  protective election under section 336(e) in connection with a  transaction. Such an election will have no effect if the transaction  does not constitute a qualified stock disposition, as defined in Sec.  1.336-1(b)(6), but will otherwise be binding and irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Parent  owns all 100 shares of Target's only class of stock. Target's only  assets are two parcels of land. Parcel 1 has a basis of $5,000 and  Parcel 2 has a basis of $4,000. Target has no liabilities. On July 1 of  Year 1, Parent sells all 100 shares of Target stock to A for $100 per  share. Parent incurs no selling costs and A incurs no acquisition costs.  On July 1, the value of Parcel 1 is $7,000 and the value of Parcel 2 is  $3,000. A section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. The sale of Target stock constitutes a qualified  stock disposition. July 1 of Year 1 is the disposition date.  Accordingly, pursuant to the section 336(e) election, for Federal income  tax purposes, rather than treating Parent as selling the stock of Target  to A, the following events are deemed to occur. Target is treated as if,  on July 1, it sold all of its assets to an unrelated person in exchange  for the ADADP of $10,000, which is allocated $7,000 to Parcel 1 and  $3,000 to Parcel 2 (see Sec. Sec. 1.336-3 and 1.338-6 for determination  of amount and allocation of ADADP). Target recognizes gain of $2,000 on  Parcel 1 and loss of $1,000 on Parcel 2. New Target is then treated as  acquiring all its assets from an unrelated person in a single  transaction in exchange for the amount of the AGUB of $10,000, which is  allocated $7,000 to Parcel 1 and $3,000 to Parcel 2 (see Sec. Sec.  1.336-4, 1.338-5, and 1.338-6 for determination of amount and allocation  of AGUB). Old Target is treated as liquidating into Parent immediately  thereafter, distributing the $10,000 deemed received in exchange for  Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 in a transaction qualifying under section 332.  Parent recognizes no gain or loss on the liquidation. A's basis in New  Target stock is $100 per share, the amount paid for the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts  are the same as in Example 1 except that Parent only sells 80 shares of  its Target stock to A and retains the other 20 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. The results are the same as in Example 1 except  that Parent also is treated as purchasing from an unrelated person on  July 2, the day after the disposition date, the 20 shares of Target  stock (New Target stock) not sold to A, for their fair market value as  determined under Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(v) of $2,000 ($100 per share).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that instead of on July 1  Parent selling 100 shares of Target stock to A, Parent distributes 100  shares to its shareholders, all of whom are unrelated to Parent, in a  transaction that does not qualify under section 355. The value of Target  stock on July 1 is $100 per share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. The distribution of Target stock constitutes a  qualified stock disposition. July 1 of Year 1 is the disposition date.  Accordingly, pursuant to the section   336(e) election, for Federal income tax purposes, rather than treating  Parent as distributing the stock of Target to its shareholders, the  following events are deemed to occur. Target is treated as if, on July  1, it sold all of its assets to an unrelated person in exchange for the  ADADP of $10,000, which is allocated $7,000 to Parcel 1 and $3,000 to  Parcel 2 (see Sec. Sec. 1.336-3 and 1.338-6 for determination of amount  and allocation of ADADP). Target recognizes gain of $2,000 on Parcel 1  and loss of $1,000 on Parcel 2. Because Target's losses realized on the  deemed asset disposition do not exceed Target's gains realized on the  deemed asset disposition, Target can recognize all of the losses from  the deemed asset disposition (see Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(i)(B)). New Target  is then treated as acquiring all its assets from an unrelated person in  a single transaction in exchange for the amount of the AGUB of $10,000,  which is allocated $7,000 to Parcel 1 and $3,000 to Parcel 2 (see  Sec. Sec. 1.336-4, 1.338-5, and 1.338-6 for determination of amount and  allocation of AGUB). Old Target is treated as liquidating into Parent  immediately thereafter, distributing the $10,000 deemed received in  exchange for Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 in a transaction qualifying under  section 332. Parent recognizes no gain or loss on the liquidation. On  July 1, immediately after the deemed liquidation of Target, Parent is  deemed to purchase from an unrelated person 100 shares of New Target  stock and distribute those New Target shares to its shareholders. Parent  recognizes no gain or loss on the deemed distribution of the shares  under Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(iv). The shareholders receive New Target stock  as a distribution pursuant to section 301 and their basis in New Target  stock received is its fair market value pursuant to section 301(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that Parent distributes  only 80 shares of Target stock to its shareholders and retains the other  20 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. The results are the same as in Example 3 except  that Parent is treated as purchasing on July 1 only 80 shares of New  Target stock and as distributing only 80 shares of New Target stock to  its shareholders and then as purchasing (and retaining) on July 2, the  day after the disposition date, 20 shares of New Target stock at their  fair market value as determined under Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(v), $2,000  ($100 per share).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Parent owns all  100 shares of Target's only class of stock. Target has two assets, both  of which are buildings used in its business. Building 1 has a basis of  $6,000 and Building 2 has a basis of $5,100. Target has no liabilities.  On January 1 of Year 1, Parent sells 50 shares of Target to A for $88  per share. Parent incurred no selling costs with respect to the sale of  Target stock and A incurred no acquisition costs with respect to the  purchase. On July 1 of Year 1, when the value of Target stock is $120  per share, Parent distributes 30 shares of Target to Parent's unrelated  shareholders. Parent retains the remaining 20 shares. On July 1, the  value of Building 1 is $7,800 and the value of Building 2 is $4,200. A  section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Because the sale of the 50 shares and the  distribution of the 30 shares occurred within a 12-month disposition  period, the 80 shares of Target stock sold and distributed were disposed  of in a qualified stock disposition. July 1 of Year 1 is the disposition  date. On July 1, Target is treated as if it sold its assets to an  unrelated person in exchange for the ADADP, $10,000 ($8,000 ((50 shares  x $88) + (30 shares x $120))/.80 ($9,600 (80 shares x $120)/$12,000 (100  shares x $120))), which is allocated to Buildings 1 and 2 in proportion  to their fair market values, $6,500 to Building 1 and $3,500 to Building  2 (see Sec. Sec. 1.336-3 and 1.338-6 for determination of amount and  allocation of ADADP). Target realizes a gain of $500 on the deemed sale  of Building 1 ($6,500-$6,000). Target realizes a loss of $1,600 on the  deemed sale of Building 2 ($3,500-$5,100). Target recognizes all of its  gains on the deemed asset disposition. However, because 30 shares of  Target stock were distributed during the 12-month disposition period and  there was a net loss of $1,100 realized on the deemed disposition of  Buildings 1 and 2, $413 of the loss on the deemed sale is disallowed  (see Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(i)(B)(2) for the determination of the  disallowed loss amount). New Target is then treated as acquiring all its  assets from an unrelated person in a single transaction in exchange for  the amount of the AGUB, $10,000 ($8,000 ((50 shares x $88) + (30 shares  x $120)) x 1.25 ((100-0)/80)), which is allocated to Buildings 1 and 2  in proportion to their fair market values, $6,500 to Building 1 and  $3,500 to Building 2 (see Sec. Sec. 1.336-4, 1.338-5, and 1.338-6 for  determination of amount and allocation of AGUB). Old Target is treated  as liquidating into Parent immediately after the deemed asset  disposition, distributing the $10,000 deemed received in exchange for  its assets in a transaction qualifying under section 332. Parent  recognizes no gain or loss on the liquidation. Parent is then deemed to  purchase 30 shares of New Target stock from an unrelated person on July  1, and to distribute those 30 New Target shares to its shareholders.  Parent recognizes no gain or loss on the deemed distribution of the 30  shares under Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(iv). Parent is then deemed to purchase  (and retain) on July 2, the day after the disposition date, 20 shares of  New Target stock at their fair market value as determined under Sec.  1.336-2(b)(1)(v), $2,000 ($100 per share (20 shares multiplied by $100  fair market value per share ($10,000 grossed-up amount realized on the  sale and   distribution of 80 shares of target stock divided by 100 shares)). A is  treated as having purchased the 50 shares of New Target stock on January  1 of Year 1 at a cost of $88 per share, the same as if no section 336(e)  election had been made. Parent's shareholders are treated as receiving  New Target stock on July 1 of Year 1 as a distribution pursuant to  section 301 and their basis in New Target stock received is $120 per  share, its fair market value, pursuant to section 301(d), the same as if  no section 336(e) election had been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. Parent owns all of the stock of Sub and 50 of the 100 outstanding  shares of Target stock. Sub owns the remaining 50 shares of Target  stock. Target's assets have an aggregate basis of $9,000. Target has no  liabilities. Parent, Sub, and Target file a consolidated Federal income  tax return. On February 1 of Year 1, Parent sells 30 shares of its  Target stock to A for $2,400. On March 1 of Year 1, Sub sells all 50  shares of its Target stock to B for $5,600. Neither Parent nor Sub  incurred any selling costs. Neither A nor B incurred any acquisition  costs. A section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Because Parent and Sub are members of the same  consolidated group, their sale of Target stock is treated as made by one  seller (see paragraph (g)(2) of this section), and the sales of Target  stock constitute a qualified stock disposition. March 1 of Year 1 is the  disposition date. For Federal income tax purposes, Parent and Sub are  not treated as selling the stock of Target to A and B, respectively.  Instead, the following events are deemed to occur. Old Target is treated  as if, on March 1, it sold all its assets to unrelated person in  exchange for the ADADP, $10,000 (see Sec. 1.336-3 for determination of  ADADP), recognizing a net gain of $1,000. New Target is then treated as  acquiring all its assets from an unrelated person in a single  transaction in exchange for the amount of the AGUB, $10,000 (see  Sec. Sec. 1.336-4 and 1.338-5 for the determination of AGUB). Old  Target is treated as liquidating into Parent and Sub immediately  thereafter, distributing the $10,000 deemed received in exchange for its  assets in a transaction qualifying under section 332 (see Sec. 1.1502- 34). Neither Parent nor Sub recognizes gain or loss on the liquidation.  Parent is then treated as purchasing from an unrelated person on March  2, the day after the disposition date, the 20 shares of Target stock  (New Target stock) retained for their fair market value as determined  under Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(v), $2,000 ($100 per share). A is treated as  having purchased 30 shares of New Target stock on February 1 of Year 1  at a cost of $2,400 ($80 per share), the same as if no section 336(e)  election had been made. B is treated as having purchased 50 shares of  New Target stock on March 1 of Year 1 at a cost of $5,600 ($112 per  share), the same as if no section 336(e) election had been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that Parent,  Sub, and Target do not join in the filing of a consolidated Federal  income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Because Parent and Sub do not join in the filing  of a consolidated Federal income tax return and no single seller sells,  exchanges, or distributes Target stock meeting the requirements of  section 1504(a)(2), the transaction does not constitute a qualified  stock disposition. The section 336(e) election made with respect to the  disposition of Target stock has no effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A and B  own 51 and 49 shares, respectively, of Seller's only class of stock.  Seller owns all 100 shares of Target's only class of stock. Seller  distributes 80 shares of Target stock to A in complete redemption of A's  51 shares of Seller in a transaction that does not qualify under section  355. A section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>. After the redemption, A no longer owns any stock of  Seller. Accordingly, A and Seller are not related persons, as defined in  Sec. 1.336-1(b)(12), and the distribution of Target stock constitutes a  qualified stock disposition. For Federal income tax purposes, rather  than Seller distributing the stock of Target to A, the following is  deemed to occur. Old Target is treated as if it sold its assets to an  unrelated person. New Target is then treated as acquiring all its assets  from an unrelated person in a single transaction. Immediately  thereafter, Old Target is treated as liquidating into Seller in a  transaction qualifying under section 332. Seller recognizes no gain or  loss on the liquidation. Seller is then treated as purchasing 80 shares  of New Target stock from an unrelated person and then distributing the  80 shares of New Target stock to A in exchange for A's 51 shares of  Seller stock. Seller recognizes no gain or loss on the distribution of  New Target stock pursuant to Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(iv). Seller is then  treated as purchasing from an unrelated person on the day after the  disposition date the 20 shares of Target stock (New Target stock)  retained for their fair market value as determined under Sec. 1.336- 2(b)(1)(v). The Federal income tax consequences to A are the same as if  no section 336(e) election had been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. A and B own 60 and 40 shares, respectively, of Seller's only  class of stock. Seller owns all 100 shares of Target's only class of  stock. Seller distributes 48 shares of Target stock to A and 32 shares  of Target stock to B in a transaction that does not qualify under  section 355. A section 336(e) election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consequences. Any stock of a corporation that is owned by  Seller would be attributed to A under section 318(a)(2)(C) because,  after the distribution, A owns 50 percent or more of the value of the  stock of Seller. Therefore, after the distribution, A and Seller are  related persons, as defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(12), and the  distribution of Target stock to A is not a disposition. Because only 32  percent of Target stock was sold, exchanged, or distributed to unrelated  persons, there has not been a qualified stock disposition. Accordingly,  the section 336(e) election made with respect to the distribution of  Target stock has no effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this  section is applicable to any qualified stock purchase or qualified stock  disposition (as defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(6)) for which the  acquisition date or disposition date (as defined in Sec. 1.336- 1(b)(8)), respectively, is on or after May 15, 2013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date.
