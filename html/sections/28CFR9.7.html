                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An owner's interest in property that has been  forfeited is represented by the property itself or by a monetary  interest equivalent to that interest at the time of seizure. Whether the  property or a monetary equivalent will be remitted to an owner shall be  determined at the discretion of the ruling official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a civil judicial forfeiture action against the property is  pending, release of the property must await an appropriate court order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the Government sells or disposes of the property prior to  the grant of the remission, the owner shall receive the proceeds of that  sale, less any costs incurred by the Government in the sale. The ruling  official, at his or her discretion, may waive the deduction of costs and  expenses incident to the forfeiture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the owner does not comply with the conditions imposed upon  release of the property by the ruling official, the property shall be  sold. Following the sale, the proceeds shall be used to pay all costs of  the forfeiture and disposition of the property, in addition to any  monetary conditions imposed. The remaining balance shall be paid to the  owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lienholders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the forfeited property is to be retained  for official use or transferred to a state or local law enforcement  agency or foreign government pursuant to law, and remission or  mitigation has been granted to a lienholder, the recipient of the  property shall assure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of remission, the lien is satisfied as determined  through the petition process; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of mitigation, an amount equal to the net equity,  less any monetary conditions imposed, is paid to the lienholder prior to  the release of the property to the recipient agency or foreign  government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the forfeited property is not retained for official use or  transferred to another agency or foreign government pursuant to law, the  lienholder shall be notified by the ruling official of the right to  select either of the following alternatives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Return of property. The lienholder may obtain possession of the  property after paying the United States, through the ruling official,  the costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture, the amount, if any,  by which the appraised value of the property exceeds the lienholder's  net equity in the property, and any amount specified in the ruling  official's decision as a condition to remit the property. The ruling  official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs and expenses  incident to the forfeiture. The ruling official shall forward a copy of  the decision, a memorandum of disposition, and the original releases to  the USMS or other property custodian who shall thereafter release the  property to the lienholder; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sale of property and payment to lienholder. Subject to Sec.   9.9(a), upon sale of the property, the lienholder may receive the  payment of a monetary amount up to the sum of the lienholder's net  equity, less the expenses and costs incident to the forfeiture and sale  of the property, and any other monetary conditions imposed. The ruling  official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs and expenses  incident to the forfeiture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the lienholder does not notify the ruling official of the  selection of one of the two options set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section within 20 days of the receipt of notification, the ruling  official shall direct the USMS or other property custodian to sell the  property and pay the lienholder an amount up to the net equity, less the  costs and expenses incurred incident to the forfeiture and sale, and any  monetary conditions imposed. In the event a lienholder subsequently  receives a payment of any kind on the debt owed for which he or she  received payment as a result of the granting of remission or mitigation,  the lienholder shall reimburse the Assets Forfeiture Fund to the extent  of the payment received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the lienholder does not comply with the conditions imposed  upon the release of the property, the property shall be sold after  forfeiture. From the proceeds of the sale, all costs   incident to the forfeiture and sale shall first be deducted, and the  balance up to the net equity, less any monetary conditions, shall be  paid to the lienholder.</p>
