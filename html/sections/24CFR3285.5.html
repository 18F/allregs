A specific anchoring assembly device designed to  transfer home anchoring loads to the ground.</p><p class="depth0">Installation instructions. DAPIA-approved instructions provided by  the home manufacturer that accompany each new manufactured home and  detail the home manufacturer requirements for support and anchoring  systems, and other work completed at the installation site to comply  with these Model Installation Standards and the   Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in 24 CFR part 3280.</p><p class="depth0">Installation standards. Reasonable specifications for the  installation of a new manufactured home, at the place of occupancy, to  ensure proper siting; the joining of all sections of the home; and the  installation of stabilization, support, or anchoring systems.</p><p class="depth0">Labeled. A label, symbol, or other identifying mark of a nationally  recognized testing laboratory, inspection agency, or other organization  concerned with product evaluation that maintains periodic inspection of  production of labeled equipment or materials, and by whose labeling is  indicated compliance with nationally recognized standards or tests to  determine suitable usage in a specified manner.</p><p class="depth0">Listed or certified. Included in a list published by a nationally  recognized testing laboratory, inspection agency, or other organization  concerned with product evaluation that maintains periodic inspection of  production of listed equipment or materials, and whose listing states  either that the equipment or material meets nationally recognized  standards or has been tested and found suitable for use in a specified  manner.</p><p class="depth0">Local authority having jurisdiction (LAHJ).
