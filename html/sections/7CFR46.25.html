                            <p class="depth0">Commission merchants, dealers and brokers who offer produce for sale  through auction companies which publish catalogs of offerings will be  responsible for furnishing the auction company for publication true and  correct information concerning the ownership of the produce. When the  produce is offered for sale by an owner, his name shall be shown in the  catalog listing as owner. When a joint account partner makes an  offering, his name as well as that of his joint partner, or partners,  shall be shown. When any person offers produce for sale at auction for  the account of another, the   name, or names of the owner, if known, and of his principal shall be  shown. In addition to listing such name or names he may show that he is  acting in the capacity of agent. If a person instructs an auction  company to catalog a shipment without disclosing true ownership, if  known, or the name of an agent's principal, he shall be deemed to have  made a false or misleading statement within the meaning of the Act.  Since sales at auctions normally involve additional expenses, a broker,  grower's agent or commission merchant shall have prior consent from his  principal before such disposition is accomplished. Where a dispute  exists regarding the ownership of produce, it may be listed in the  auction catalog as being offered for sale ``for the account of whom  concerned'' with the name of the party making the offering shown as  agent.</p><p class="depth0">Duties of Licensees</p>
