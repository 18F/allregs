                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time,  initiate action to add or adjust management measures within the Atlantic  Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP if it finds that action is necessary to  meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustment process. The MAFMC shall develop and analyze  appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC  meetings. The MAFMC must provide the public with advance notice of the  availability of the recommendation(s), appropriate justification(s) and  economic and biological analyses, and the opportunity to comment on the  proposed adjustment(s) at the first meeting, and prior to and at the  second MAFMC meeting. The MAFMC's recommendations on adjustments or  additions to management measures must come from one or more of the  following categories: Adjustments within existing ABC control rule  levels; adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy; introduction of  new AMs, including sub-ACTs; the overfishing definition (both the  threshold and target levels); description and identification of EFH (and  fishing gear management measures that impact EFH); habitat areas of  particular concern; set-aside quota for scientific research; VMS; OY  range; suspension or adjustment of the surfclam minimum size limit; and  changes to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the  means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery  stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day  allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set  aside programs. Issues that require significant   departures from previously contemplated measures or that are otherwise  introducing new concepts may require an amendment of the FMP instead of  a framework adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and  receiving public testimony, the MAFMC shall make a recommendation to the  Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include  supporting rationale, if management measures are recommended, an  analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator  on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the  MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a  final rule, it must consider at least the following factors, and provide  support and analysis for each factor considered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the availability of data on which the recommended  management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a  proposed rule, and whether the regulations would have to be in place for  an entire harvest/fishing season.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for  participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the  development of recommended management measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management  measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NMFS action. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes adjustments  or additions to management measures and after reviewing the MAFMC's  recommendation and supporting information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures  and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued  as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management  measures and determines that the recommended management measures should  be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as  a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public  comment, if NMFS concurs with the MAFMC recommendation, the measures  will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If NMFS does not concur, the MAFMC will be notified in writing  of the reasons for the non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Emergency actions. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate  from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under  section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [76 FR 60625, Sept. 29, 2011, as amended at 76 FR 81848, Dec. 29, 2011;  80 FR 37194, June 30, 2015]</p>
