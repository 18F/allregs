                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25). The  permit may, when appropriate, specify a schedule of compliance leading  to compliance with CWA and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time for compliance. Any schedules of compliance under this  section shall require compliance as soon as possible, but not later than  the applicable statutory deadline under the CWA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first NPDES permit issued to a new source or a new  discharger shall contain a schedule of compliance only when necessary to  allow a reasonable opportunity to attain compliance with requirements  issued or revised after commencement of construction but less than three  years before commencement of the relevant discharge. For recommencing  dischargers, a schedule of compliance shall be available only when  necessary to allow a reasonable opportunity to attain compliance with  requirements issued or revised less than three years before  recommencement of discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interim dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of  this section, if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which  exceeds 1 year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule shall set  forth interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time between interim dates shall not exceed 1 year, except  that in the case of a schedule for compliance with standards for sewage  sludge use and disposal, the time between interim dates shall not exceed  six months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the time necessary for completion of any interim requirement  (such as the construction of a control facility) is more than 1 year and  is not readily divisible into stages for completion, the permit shall  specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward  completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected  completion date.</p><p class="depth4">Note: Examples of interim requirements include: (a) Submit a  complete Step 1 construction grant (for POTWs); (b) let a contract for  construction of required facilities; (c) commence construction of  required facilities; (d) complete construction of required facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reporting. The permit shall be written to require that no later  than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of  compliance, the permittee shall notify the Director in writing of its  compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements, or  submit progress reports if paragraph (a)(3)(ii) is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative schedules of compliance. An NPDES permit applicant  or permittee may cease conducting regulated activities (by terminating  of direct discharge for NPDES sources) rather than continuing to operate  and meet permit requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the permittee decides to cease conducting regulated  activities at a given time within the term of a permit which has already  been issued:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permit may be modified to contain a new or additional  schedule leading to timely cessation of activities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The permittee shall cease conducting permitted activities  before non-compliance with any interim or final compliance schedule  requirement already specified in the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the decision to cease conducting regulated activities is made  before issuance of a permit whose term will include the termination  date, the permit shall contain a schedule leading to termination which  will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements no later than  the statutory deadline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the permittee is undecided whether to cease conducting  regulated activities, the Director may issue or modify a permit to  contain two schedules as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Both schedules shall contain an identical interim deadline  requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting regulated  activities no later than a date which ensures sufficient time to comply  with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to  continue conducting regulated activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One schedule shall lead to timely compliance with applicable  requirements, no later than the statutory deadline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The second schedule shall lead to cessation of regulated  activities by a date which will ensure timely compliance with applicable  requirements no later than the statutory deadline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each permit containing two schedules shall include a  requirement that after the permittee has made a final decision under  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section it shall follow the schedule leading  to compliance if the decision is to continue conducting regulated  activities, and follow the schedule leading to termination if the  decision is to cease conducting regulated activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The applicant's or permittee's decision to cease conducting  regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public commitment  satisfactory to the Director, such as a resolution of the board of  directors of a corporation.
