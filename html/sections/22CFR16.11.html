                                Sec. 16.11  Grievance Board consideration of grievances.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing of grievance. A grievant whose grievance is not resolved satisfactorily under agency procedures (Sec. 16.7) shall be entitled to file a grievance with the Grievance Board no later than 60 days after receiving the agency decision. In the event that an agency has not provided its decision within 90 days of presentation, the grievant shall be entitled to file a grievance with the Grievance Board no later than 150 days after the date of presentation to the agency. The Board may extend or waive, for good cause, the time limits stated in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaustion of agency procedures. In the event that the Grievance Board finds that a grievance has not been presented for agency consideration or that a grievance has been expanded or modified to include materially different elements, the Board shall return the grievance to the official responsible for final agency review unless the agency waives any objection to Board consideration of the grievance without such review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prescription of interim relief. If the Grievance Board determines that the agency is considering any action of the character of separation or termination of the grievant, disciplinary action against the grievant, or recovery from the grievant of alleged overpayment of salary, expenses, or allowances, which is related to a grievance pending before the Board, and that such action should be suspended, the agency shall suspend such action until the Board has ruled upon the grievance. Notwithstanding such suspension of action, the head of the agency concerned or a chief of mission or principal officer may exclude an officer or employee from official premises or from the performance of specified duties when such exclusion is determined in writing to be essential to the functioning of the post or office to which the officer or employee is assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inquiry into grievances. The Board shall conduct a hearing at the request of a grievant in any case which involves disciplinary action, or a grievant's retirement from the Service under sections 633 and 634 of the Act, or which in the judgment of the Board can best be resolved by a hearing or by presentation of oral argument. In those grievances in which the Board holds no hearing, the Board shall offer to each party the opportunity to review and to supplement, by written submission, the record of proceedings prior to its decision.</p>
