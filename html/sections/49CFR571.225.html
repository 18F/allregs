This standard establishes requirements for  child restraint anchorage systems to ensure their proper location and  strength for the effective securing of child restraints, to reduce the  likelihood of the anchorage systems' failure, and to increase the  likelihood that child restraints are properly secured and thus more  fully achieve their potential effectiveness in motor vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars; to trucks  and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating  (GVWR) of 3,855 kilograms (8,500 pounds) or less; and to   buses (including school buses) with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or  less. This standard does not apply to walk-in van-type vehicles,  vehicles manufactured to be sold exclusively to the U.S. Postal Service,  shuttle buses, and funeral coaches.</p><p class="depth0">S3.
