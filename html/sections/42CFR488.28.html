                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient in one or  more of the standards in the conditions of participation, conditions for  coverage, or conditions for certification or requirements, it may  participate in, or be covered under, the Medicare program only if the  provider or supplier has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for  achieving compliance within a reasonable period of time acceptable to  CMS. In the case of an immediate jeopardy situation, CMS may require a  shorter time period for achieving compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in  combination neither jeopardize the health and safety of patients nor are  of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to  render adequate care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it is determined during a survey that a provider or  supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards, it is  granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of time depends upon the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nature of the deficiency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the  facility to provide adequate and safe care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps  needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being notified of the  deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional  time be granted by the Secretary in individual situations, if in its  judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for  example, a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or  engage in competitive bidding.
