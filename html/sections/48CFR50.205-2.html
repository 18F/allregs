                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requiring activity responsibilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the requiring  activity determines that the technology to be acquired may qualify for  SAFETY Act protection, the requiring activity is responsible for  requesting a pre-qualification designation notice from DHS. Such a  request for a pre-qualification designation notice should be made once  the requiring activity has determined that the technology specifications  or statement of work are established and are unlikely to undergo  substantive modification. DHS will then determine whether the technology  identified in the request either affirmatively or presumptively  satisfies the technical criteria for SAFETY Act designation. An  affirmative determination means the technology described in the pre- qualification designation notice satisfies the technical criteria for  SAFETY Act designation as a QATT. A presumptive determination means that  the technology is a good candidate for SAFETY Act designation as a QATT.  In either case, the notice will authorize offerors to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit a streamlined application for SAFETY Act designation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receive expedited review of their application for SAFETY Act  designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requiring activity shall make requests using the procurement  pre-qualification request form available at http://www.SAFETYAct.gov.  The website includes instructions for completing and submitting the  form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requiring activity shall provide a copy of the request, as  well as a copy of the resulting pre-qualification designation notice or  DHS denial, to the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting officer responsibilities. Upon receipt of the  documentation specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, the  contracting officer shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include in any pre-solicitation notice (Subpart 5.2) that a pre- qualification designation notice has been--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requested and is under review by DHS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Denied by DHS; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Issued and a copy will be included with the solicitation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incorporate the pre-qualification designation notice into the  solicitation.
