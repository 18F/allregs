The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may, at the option of the incomplete vehicle manufacturer, be stated as a single value, with the label indicating to which axles the ratings apply.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of combined ratings: (a) All axles--2,400 kg (5,290 lb) with LT245/75R16(E) tires;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Front--5,215 kg (11,500 lb) with 295/75R22.5(G) tires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> First intermediate to rear--9,070 kg (20,000 lb) with 295/75R22.5(G) tires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Listing of the vehicle types as defined in 49 CFR 571.3 (e.g., truck, MPV, bus, trailer) into which the incomplete vehicle may appropriately be manufactured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Listing, by number, of each standard, in effect at the time of manufacture of the incomplete vehicle, that applies to any of the vehicle types listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, followed in each case by one of the following three types of statement, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Type 1--A statement that the vehicle when completed will conform to the standard if no alterations are made in identified components of the incomplete vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Example: 104-This vehicle when completed will conform to FMVSS No. 104, Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, if no alterations are made in the windshield wiper components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Type 2--A statement of specific conditions of final manufacture under which the manufacturer specifies that the completed vehicle will conform to the standard.</p><p class="depth0">Example: 121--This vehicle when completed will conform to FMVSS No. 121, Air Brake Systems, if it does not exceed any of the gross axle weight ratings, if the center of gravity at GVWR is not higher than nine feet above the ground, and if no alterations are made in any brake system component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Type 3--A statement that conformity with the standard cannot be determined based upon the components supplied on the incomplete vehicle, and that the incomplete vehicle manufacturer makes no representation as to conformity with the standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Each document shall contain a table of contents or chart summarizing all the standards applicable to the vehicle pursuant to 49 CFR 568.4(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A certification that the statements contained in the incomplete vehicle document are accurate as of the date of manufacture of the incomplete vehicle and can be used and relied on by any intermediate and/or final-stage manufacturer as a basis for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To the extent the IVD expressly incorporates by reference body builder or other design and engineering guidance (Reference Material), the incomplete vehicle manufacturer shall make such Reference Material readily available to subsequent manufacturers. Reference Materials incorporated by reference in the IVD shall be deemed to be part of the IVD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The IVD shall be attached to the incomplete vehicle in such a manner that it will not be inadvertently detached, or alternatively, it may be sent directly to a final-stage manufacturer, intermediate manufacturer or purchaser for purposes other than resale to whom the incomplete vehicle is delivered. The Reference Material in paragraph (b) of this section need not be attached to each vehicle.
