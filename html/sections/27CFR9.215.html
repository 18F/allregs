For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Lake Chelan'' and ``Chelan'' are terms of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The five United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Lake Chelan viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manson Quadrangle, Washington--Chelan Co., 1968, photorevised 1987;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cooper Ridge Quadrangle--Washington, 1968, photorevised 1987;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chelan Quadrangle--Washington, 1968, photorevised 1987;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Chelan Falls Quadrangle--Washington, 1968, photorevised 1981; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Winesap Quadrangle--Washington, 1968, photorevised 1987.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary.
