The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with  an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Micro-purchase Threshold but  not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR  at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable  expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small  business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery  and award will be made at fair market prices. This requirement does not  preclude a contracting officer from making an award to a small business  under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB Programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions Valued Above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an  anticipated dollar value exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold  (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when  there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at  least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of  quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices.  However, after conducting market research, the contracting officer shall  first consider a set-aside or sole source award (if the sole source  award is permitted by statute or regulation) under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone,  SDVO SBC or WOSB programs before setting aside the requirement as a  small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a)  BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs. The contracting officer must  document the contract file with the rationale used to support the  specific set-aside, including the type and extent of market research  conducted. In addition, the contracting officer must document the  contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's  certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) (or any  successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SBA believes that Progress in fulfilling the various small  business goals, as well as other factors such as the results of market  research, programmatic needs specific to the procuring agency,  anticipated award price, and the acquisition history, will be considered  in making a decision as to which program to use for the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the contracting officer decides to set aside the requirement  for competition restricted to qualified HUBZone SBCs, the contracting  officer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a reasonable expectation after reviewing SBA's list of  qualified HUBZone SBCs that at least two responsible qualified HUBZone  SBCs will submit offers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine that award can be made at fair market price.
