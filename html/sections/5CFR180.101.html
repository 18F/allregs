                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of  1964, 31 U.S.C. 240 to 243, authorizes the Director, Office of Personnel  Management to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of  officers and employees of OPM, amounting to not more than $15,000, for  damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Claims  are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible  personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall  determine to be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances  existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is  reasonable, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the  type and quantity of property involved, circumstances attending  acquistion and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the  claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Government does not underwrite all personal property losses  that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual  tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of  property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to  the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be  reasonable, useful, or proper. If individuals possess excessive  quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property  privately insured.</p>
