                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system that has a separate source of power or heating element, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of that component and monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the surface temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas temperature shall be monitored within the water trap or the sample dewpoint shall be monitored downstream. In either case, the indicated temperature shall not exceed 7 C.
