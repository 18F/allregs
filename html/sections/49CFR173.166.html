                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of this section, safety devices are articles which  contain pyrotechnic substances or hazardous materials of other classes  and are used in vehicles, vessels or aircraft to enhance safety to  persons. Examples are: air bag inflators, air bag modules, seat-belt  pretensioners and pyromechanical devices. Pyromechanical devices are  assembled components for tasks such as but not limited to separation,  locking, release-and-drive or occupant restraint. The term includes  ``Safety devices, pyrotechnic.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. An air bag inflator (consisting of a casing  containing an igniter, a booster material, a gas generant and, in some  cases, a pressure receptacle (cylinder)) is a gas generator used to  inflate an air bag in a supplemental restraint system in a motor  vehicle. An air bag module is the air bag inflator plus an inflatable  bag assembly. A seat-belt pretensioner contains similar hazardous  materials and is used in the operation of a seat-belt restraining system  in a motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, and who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not manufacture or market explosives or safety devices, is  not owned in whole or in part, or is not financially dependent upon any  entity that manufactures or markets explosives or safety devices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Performs all examination and testing in accordance with the  applicable requirements as specified in special provision 160 (see  Sec. 172.102 of this subchapter); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintains records in accordance with paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> By adhering to all the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, a Class 9 (UN3268) air bag inflator, air bag module or  seat-belt pretensioner design is not required to be submitted to the  Associate Administrator for approval or assigned an EX number. All other  Class 9 (UN3268) safety device designs are required to be submitted to  the Associate Administrator for approval and assigned an EX number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A safety device may be classed as Division 1.4G if the maximum  parameters of each design type have been examined and successfully  tested by a person or agency who is authorized by the Associate  Administrator to perform such examination and testing of explosives  under Sec. 173.56(b)(1). As a Class 1 explosive, the manufacturer must  submit to the Associate Administrator a report of the examination and  assignment of a recommended shipping description, division, and  compatibility group, and if the Associate Administrator finds the  approval request meets the regulatory criteria, the explosive may be  approved in writing and assigned an EX number; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer has submitted an application, including a  classification issued by the competent authority of a foreign government  to the Associate Administrator, and received written notification from  the Associate Administrator that the device has been approved for  transportation and assigned an EX number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EX numbers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a safety device is classed and approved as  a Division 1.4G and offered for transportation, the shipping paper must  contain the EX number or product code for each approved device in  association with the basic description required by Sec. 172.202(a) of  this subchapter. Product codes must be traceable to the specific EX  number assigned to the device by the Associate Administrator. Further,  if the EX number or product code is contained on the shipping paper then  it is not required to be marked on the outside package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A safety device, when classed as a Class 9 (UN3268), is excepted  from the EX number, or product code shipping paper requirements of  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. (1) A safety device that is classed as a Class 9  (UN3268) under the terms of paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section and is  installed in a motor vehicle, aircraft, boat or other transport  conveyance or its completed components, such as steering columns or door  panels, is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter. A safety  device that has been classed as a Division 1.4G and approved by the  Associate Administrator and is installed in a motor vehicle, aircraft,  boat or other transport conveyance or its completed components, such as  steering columns or door panels, is not subject to the requirements of  this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An air bag module containing an inflator that has been  previously approved by the Associate Administrator for transportation is  not required to be submitted for further examination or approval. For  classifications granted after July 30, 2013, if the Class 9 designation  for the inflator is contingent upon packaging or other special means  specified by the authorized testing agency, the modules must be tested  and certified separately to determine if they can be shipped as  ``UN3268, Safety Devices, 9, PG III''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An air bag module containing an inflator that has previously  been approved by the Associate Administrator as a Division 2.2 material  is not required to be submitted for further examination to be reclassed  as a Class 9 material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Shipments to recycling or waste disposal facilities. When  offered for domestic transportation by highway, rail freight, cargo  vessel or cargo aircraft, a serviceable safety device classed as either  Class 9 (UN3268) or Division 1.4G removed from a motor vehicle that was  manufactured as required for use in the United States may be offered for  transportation and transported without compliance with the shipping  paper requirement prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. However,  when these articles are shipped to a recycling facility, the word  ``Recycled'' must be entered on the shipping paper immediately after the  basic description prescribed in Sec. 172.202 of this subchapter. No more  than one device is authorized in the packaging prescribed in paragraph  (e)(1), (2) or (3) of this section. The device must be cushioned and  secured within the package to prevent movement during transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An air bag inflator, air bag module, or seat-belt pretensioner  that was classed and approved for transportation prior to January 1,  2015 may continue to be transported under the terms of the existing  approval, using the appropriate proper shipping name ``Safety Devices''  or ``Safety Devices, Pyrotechnic'' based on the classification of the  device as assigned by PHMSA or the authorized person or agency that  examined and tested the design type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Until January 1, 2016, for domestic transportation by highway,  rail, and vessel, packages containing air bag inflators, air bag  modules, or seat-belt pretensioners may be;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Marked with either the appropriate proper shipping name, or an  appropriate proper shipping name authorized by Sec. 172.101 in effect on  December 31, 2014; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Described on a shipping paper with either the appropriate  proper shipping name, or an appropriate proper shipping name authorized  by Sec. 172.101 in effect on December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em>, (2), and (3) of this section must meet the packaging  specification and performance requirements of part 178 of this  subchapter at the Packing Group III performance level. The packagings  must be designed and constructed to prevent movement of the articles and  inadvertent activation.
