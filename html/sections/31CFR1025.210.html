Not later than May 2, 2006, each insurance company shall develop and implement a written anti-money laundering program applicable to its covered products that is reasonably designed to prevent the insurance company from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities. The program must be approved by senior management. An insurance company shall make a copy of its anti-money laundering program available to the Department of the Treasury, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or their designee upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum requirements. At a minimum, the program required by paragraph (a) of this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incorporate policies, procedures, and internal controls based upon the insurance company's assessment of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with its covered products. Policies, procedures, and internal controls developed and implemented by an insurance company under this section shall include provisions for complying with the applicable requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code and this chapter, integrating the company's insurance agents and insurance brokers into its anti-money laundering program, and obtaining all relevant customer-related information necessary for an effective anti-money laundering program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designate a compliance officer who will be responsible for ensuring that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The anti-money laundering program is implemented effectively, including monitoring compliance by the company's insurance agents and insurance brokers with their obligations under the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The anti-money laundering program is updated as necessary; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Appropriate persons are educated and trained in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide for on-going training of appropriate persons concerning their responsibilities under the program.
