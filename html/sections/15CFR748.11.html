                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exceptions to completing a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. A Statement by the Ultimate Consignee and/or Purchaser involved in a transaction must be completed unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An International Import Certificate, a People's Republic of China End-User Certificate, an Indian Import Certificate, or a Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian or Slovak Import Certificate is required in support of the license application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee, provided the

required statements are contained in Block 24 on the license application. This exemption does not apply where the applicant and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or affiliated or associated firms;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application is valued at $5000 or less, and is not part of a larger transaction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transaction meets one of the exemptions stated in Sec. 748.9(a) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. A copy of the statement must be submitted with your license application if the country of ultimate destination is listed in either Country Group D:2, D:3, or D:4 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). The copy submitted by the applicant must be of sufficient quality to ensure all assertions made on the statement are legible and that the signatures are sufficiently legible to permit identification of the signature as that of the signer. The applicant must receive the manually-signed original within 60 days from the date the original is signed by the ultimate consignee. The applicant must, upon receipt, retain the manually-signed original, and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser should retain a copy of the statement in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Form or letter. The ultimate consignee and purchaser must complete either a statement on company letterhead in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section or Form BIS-711, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. If the consignee and purchaser elect to complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary. If the ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate statements must be prepared and signed. If the ultimate consignee and purchaser elects to complete Form BIS-711, only one Form BIS-711 (containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser) need be completed. Whether your ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a written statement or complete Form BIS-711, the following constraints apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee and purchaser must sign the statement. ``Responsible official'' is defined as someone with personal knowledge of the information included in the statement, and authority to bind the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom they sign, and who has the power and authority to control the use and disposition of the licensed items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located in the U.S. or in a foreign country. The official title of the person signing the statement must also be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send a new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Instructions for completing Form BIS-711. Instructions on completing Form BIS-711 are contained in Supplement No. 3 to this part. The ultimate consignee and purchaser may sign a legible copy of Form BIS-711.
