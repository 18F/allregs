                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State transportation department is that department, commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for highway construction. The term State should be considered equivalent to State transportation department if the context so implies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided for as emergency repair work in Sec. 668.105(i) and in Sec. 635.204(b), the term some other method of construction as used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b) shall mean the force account method of construction as defined herein. In the unlikely event that circumstances are considered to justify a negotiated contract or another unusual method of construction, the policies and procedures prescribed herein for force account work will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term force account shall mean the direct performance of highway construction work by a State transportation department, a county, a railroad, or a public utility company by use of labor, equipment, materials, and supplies furnished by them and used under their direct control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term county shall mean any county, township, municipality or other political subdivision that may be empowered to cooperate with the State transportation department in highway matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term cost effective shall mean the efficient use of labor, equipment, materials and supplies to assure the lowest overall cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For the purpose of this part, an emergency shall be deemed to exist when emergency repair work as provided for in Sec. 668.105(i) is necessary or when a major element or segment of the highway system has failed and the situation is such that competitive bidding is not possible or is impractical because immediate action is necessary to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimize the extent of the damage,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protect remaining facilities, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restore essential travel.
This definition of emergency has no applicability to the Emergency Relief Program of 23 CFR part 668.
