                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may not appeal a ruling or decision of the administrative law judge to the FAA decisionmaker until the initial decision has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the FAA decisionmaker on an interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the Secretary for the purposes of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. chapter 7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the administrative law judge issues a decision on the request. If the administrative law judge grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The administrative law judge must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the interlocutory appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, without the consent of the administrative law judge, before an initial decision has been entered in the case of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A ruling or order by the administrative law judge barring a party, or a party's attorney or representative, from the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A ruling or order by the administrative law judge allegedly in violation of the limitations on the administrative law judge under Sec.  406.109(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure of the administrative law judge to grant a motion for a confidentiality order based on 51 U.S.C. 50916, under Sec.  406.117(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure of the administrative law judge to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with Sec.  406.135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure. A party must file with the Federal Docket Management System and serve each other party a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause. A party must file with the Federal Docket Management System a reply brief, if any, and serve a copy of the reply brief on each party, not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief. The FAA decisionmaker must render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rejection of interlocutory appeal. The FAA decisionmaker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a

proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.
