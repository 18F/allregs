                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An electrohydraulic lithotriptor is an AC-powered device used to fragment urinary bladder stones. It consists of a high voltage source connected by a cable to a bipolar electrode that is introduced into the urinary bladder through a cystoscope. The electrode is held against the stone in a water-filled bladder and repeated electrical discharges between the two poles of the electrode cause electrohydraulic shock waves which disintegrate the stone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II. The special control for this device is FDA's ``Guidance for the Content of Premarket Notifications for Intracorporeal Lithotripters.''
