                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before we grant a right-of-way, we must determine that the right-of-way is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that determination, we will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review the right-of-way application and supporting documents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify potential environmental impacts and adverse impacts, and ensure compliance with all applicable Federal environmental, land use, historic preservation, and cultural resource laws and ordinances; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require any modifications or mitigation measures necessary to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land use requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving a right-of-way application, we will promptly notify the applicant whether the package is complete. A complete package includes all of the information and supporting documents required under this subpart, including but not limited to, an accurate legal description for each affected tract, documentation of landowner consent, NEPA review documentation and valuation documentation, where applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the right-of-way application package is not complete, our letter will identify the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If we do not respond to the submission of an application package, the parties may take action under Sec. 169.304.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the right-of-way application package is complete, we will notify the applicant of the date of our receipt of the complete package. Within 60 days of our receipt of a complete package, we will grant or deny the right-of-way, return the package for revision, or inform the applicant in writing that we need additional review time. If we inform the applicant in writing that we need additional time, then:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Our letter informing the applicant that we need additional review time must identify our initial concerns and invite the applicant to respond within 15 days of the date of the letter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We will issue a written determination granting or denying the right-of-way within 30 days from sending the letter informing the applicant that we need additional time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we do not meet the deadlines in this section, then the applicant may take appropriate action under Sec. 169.304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will provide any right-of-way denial and the basis for the determination, along with notification of any appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter to the parties to the right-of-way. If the right-of-way is granted, we will provide a copy of the right-of-way to the tribal landowner and, upon written request, make copies available to the individual Indian landowners, and provide notice under Sec. 169.12.</p>
