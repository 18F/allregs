An electronic signature based upon cryptographic methods of originator authentication, computed by using a set of rules and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the data can be verified. A signer creates a digital signature by using public-key encryption to transform a message digest of an electronic message. If a recipient of the digital signature has an electronic message, message digest function, and the signer's public key, the recipient can verify:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Whether the transformation was accomplished with the private key that corresponds to the signer's public key; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Whether the electronic message has been altered since the transformation was made.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic document receiving system. Any set of apparatus, procedures, software, records, or documentation used to receive documents communicated to it via a telecommunications network.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic signature. A computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols executed, adopted, or authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual's handwritten signature, and that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Indicates such person's approval of the information contained in the electronic message.</p><p class="depth2">Form(s).
