                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A drug master file is a submission of information to the Food  and Drug Administration by a person (the drug master file holder) who  intends it to be used for one of the following purposes: To permit the  holder to incorporate the information by reference when the holder  submits an investigational new drug application under part 312 or  submits an application or an abbreviated application or an amendment or  supplement to them under this part, or to permit the holder to authorize  other persons to rely on the information to support a submission to FDA  without the holder having to disclose the information to the person. FDA  ordinarily neither independently reviews drug master files nor approves  or disapproves submissions to a drug master file. Instead, the agency  customarily reviews the information only in the context of an  application under part 312 or this part. A drug master file may contain  information of the kind required for any submission to the agency,  including information about the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drug substance, drug substance intermediate, and materials used  in their preparation, or drug product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Packaging materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excipient, colorant, flavor, essence, or materials used in their  preparation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> FDA-accepted reference information. (A person wishing to submit  information and supporting data in a drug master file (DMF) that is not  covered by Types II through IV DMF's must first submit a letter of  intent to   the Drug Master File Staff, Food and Drug Administration, 5901-B  Ammendale Rd., Beltsville, MD 20705-1266.) FDA will then contact the  person to discuss the proposed submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An investigational new drug application or an application,  abbreviated application, amendment, or supplement may incorporate by  reference all or part of the contents of any drug master file in support  of the submission if the holder authorizes the incorporation in writing.  Each incorporation by reference is required to describe the incorporated  material by name, reference number, volume, and page number of the drug  master file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A drug master file is required to be submitted in two copies.  The agency has prepared guidance that provides information about how to  prepare a well-organized drug master file. If the drug master file  holder adds, changes, or deletes any information in the file, the holder  shall notify in writing, each person authorized to reference that  information. Any addition, change, or deletion of information in a drug  master file (except the list required under paragraph (d) of this  section) is required to be submitted in two copies and to describe by  name, reference number, volume, and page number the information affected  in the drug master file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The drug master file is required to contain a complete list of  each person currently authorized to incorporate by reference any  information in the file, identifying by name, reference number, volume,  and page number the information that each person is authorized to  incorporate. If the holder restricts the authorization to particular  drug products, the list is required to include the name of each drug  product and the application number, if known, to which the authorization  applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The public availability of data and information in a drug master  file, including the availability of data and information in the file to  a person authorized to reference the file, is determined under part 20  and Sec. 314.430.  [50 FR 7493, Feb. 22, 1985, as amended at 50 FR 21238, May 23, 1985; 53  FR 33122, Aug. 30, 1988; 55 FR 28380, July 11, 1990; 65 FR 1780, Jan.  12, 2000; 65 FR 56479, Sept. 19, 2000; 67 FR 9586, Mar. 4, 2002; 69 FR  13473, Mar. 23, 2004]</p>
