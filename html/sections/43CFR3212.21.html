                            <p class="depth0">A qualified expansion project must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It must involve substantial capital expenditure. Examples  include the drilling of additional wells, retrofitting existing wells  and collection systems to increase production rates, retrofitting  turbines or power plant components to increase efficiency, adding  additional generation capacity to existing plants, and enhanced recovery  projects such as augmented injection. Projects that are not associated  with substantial capital expenditure, such as opening production valves  and operating existing equipment at higher rates, do not qualify as  expansion projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The project must have the potential to increase the net  generation by more than 10 percent over the projected generation without  the project, using data from the previous 5 years. If 5 years of data  are not available, it is not a qualified expansion project.</p>
