                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A special tax stamp is a receipt for tax, personal to  the one to whom issued, and is not transferable from one manufacturer of  tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, or export  warehouse proprietor to another. If there is a change in the ownership  of a special-tax payer, the successor must pay a new special  (occupational) tax and obtain the required special tax stamp(s).  Examples of changes in ownership that require payment of a new special  tax include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sale of business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Formation of a partnership by two persons who have paid special  tax;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Addition of a partner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Incorporation of the business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Creation of a new corporation to replace one or more  corporations that have paid special tax; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Stockholder continuing the business of a corporation after its  dissolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes that do not require payment of a new special tax. The  following changes do not require payment of a special tax:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increase in capital stock of a corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in ownership of any or all of the capital stock of a  corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemption for certain successors. Persons identified in  paragraph (d) of this section as having the right of succession may  carry on the business for the remainder of the tax year for which the  special tax was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30  days after the date on which the successor begins to carry on the  business, the successor files with TTB a special tax return on TTB Form  5630.5t showing the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to  a business for which special tax has been paid, and who fails to  register the succession, is liable for special tax computed from the  first day of the calendar month in which the successor began to carry on  the business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Persons having right of succession. The right of succession  referred to in paragraph (c) of this section will pass to the identified  persons in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Death. The surviving spouse or child, or the executor,  administrator, or other legal representative, of a deceased taxpayer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Succession of spouse. A husband or wife succeeding to the  business of his or her living spouse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insolvency. A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee  for the benefit of creditors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawal from firm. The partner or partners remaining after  the death or withdrawal of a member of a partnership.   (26 U.S.C. 5733)</p><p class="depth3">Stamps for Incorrect Period or Incorrect Liability</p>
