Written responses to written requests for information from the designated officials of affected States or affected Indian tribes will be provided within 30 days after receipt of the written requests. In performing any study of an area for the purpose of determining the suitability of such area for the development of a repository, the DOE shall consult and cooperate with the Governor and the legislature of an affected State and the governing body of an affected Indian tribe in an effort to resolve concerns regarding public health and safety, environmental impacts, socioeconomic impacts, and technical aspects of the siting process. After notifying affected States and affected Indian tribes that potentially acceptable sites have been identified, or that a site has been approved for characterization, the DOE shall seek to enter into binding written agreements with such affected States or affected Indian tribes in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The DOE shall also consult, as appropriate, with other Federal agencies.</p>
