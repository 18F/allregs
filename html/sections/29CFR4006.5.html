                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Variable-rate premium exemptions. A plan described in any of paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this section is not required to determine or report its unfunded vested benefits under Sec. 4006.4 and does not owe a variable-rate premium under Sec. 4006.3(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plans without vested participants. A plan is described in this paragraph if it does not have any participants with vested benefits as of the UVB valuation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 412(e)(3) plans. A plan is described in this paragraph if the plan is a plan described in section 412(e)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder on the UVB valuation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Plans terminating in standard terminations. The exemption for a plan described in this paragraph is conditioned upon the plan's making a final distribution of assets in a standard termination. If a plan is ultimately unable to do so, the exemption is revoked and all variable-rate amounts not paid pursuant to this exemption are due retroactive to the applicable due date(s). A plan is described in this paragraph if it makes a final distribution of assets in a standard termination during the premium payment year or if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan administrator has issued notices of intent to terminate the plan in a standard termination in accordance with section 4041(a)(2) of ERISA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed termination date set forth in the notice of intent to terminate is before the beginning of the premium payment year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certain small new and newly covered plans. A plan is described in this paragraph if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is a small plan other than a continuation plan, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is a new plan or a newly covered plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting exemption for plans paying capped variable-rate premium. A plan that qualifies for the variable-rate premium cap described in ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(H) is not required to determine or report its unfunded vested benefits under Sec. 4006.4 if it reports that it qualifies for the cap and pays a variable-rate premium equal to the amount of the cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Participant count date; in general. Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the participant count date of a plan is the last day of the plan year preceding the premium payment year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Participant count date; new and newly covered plans. The participant count date of a new plan or a newly covered plan is the first day of the premium payment year. For this purpose, a new plan's premium payment year begins on the plan's effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Participant count date; certain mergers and spinoffs. (1) The participant count date of a plan described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is the first day of the premium payment year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participant count date of a plan described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is the first day of the premium payment year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A plan is described in this paragraph (e)(2) for a plan year if --</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan engages in a merger or spinoff that is not de minimis pursuant to the regulations under section 414(l) of the Code (in the case of single-employer plans) or pursuant to part 4231

of this chapter (in the case of multiemployer plans), as applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The merger or spinoff is effective at the beginning of the premium payment year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The plan is the transferee plan in the case of a merger or the transferor plan in the case of a spinoff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proration for certain short plan years. The premium for a plan that has a short plan year described in this paragraph (f) is prorated by the number of months in the short plan year (treating a part of a month as a month). The proration applies whether or not the short plan year ends by the premium due date for the short plan year. For purposes of this paragraph (f), there is a short plan year in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New or newly covered plan. A new plan becomes effective less than one full year before the beginning of its second plan year, or a newly covered plan becomes covered on a date other than the first day of its plan year. (Cessation of coverage before the end of a plan year does not give rise to proration under this section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in plan year. A plan amendment changes the plan year, but only if the plan does not merge into or consolidate with another plan or otherwise cease its independent existence either during the short plan year or at the beginning of the full plan year following the short plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distribution of assets. The plan's assets (other than any excess assets) are distributed pursuant to the plan's termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appointment of trustee. The plan is a single-employer plan, and a plan trustee is appointed pursuant to section 4042 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Alternative premium funding target. A plan's alternative premium funding target is determined in the same way as its standard premium funding target except that the discount rates described in ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv) are not used. Instead, the alternative premium funding target is determined using the discount rates that would have been used to determine the funding target for the plan under ERISA section 303 for the purpose of determining the plan's minimum contribution under ERISA section 303 for the UVB valuation year if the segment rate stabilization provisions of ERISA section 303(h)(2)(iv) were disregarded. A plan may elect to compute unfunded vested benefits using the alternative premium funding target instead of the standard premium funding target described in Sec. 4006.4(b)(2), and may revoke such an election, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (g). A plan must compute its unfunded vested benefits using the alternative premium funding target instead of the standard premium funding target described in Sec. 4006.4(b)(2) if an election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target is in effect for the premium payment year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target for a plan must specify the premium payment year to which it first applies and must be filed by the plan's variable-rate premium due date for that premium payment year. The premium payment year to which the election first applies must begin at least five years after the beginning of the premium payment year to which a revocation of a prior election first applied. The election will be effective--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the premium payment year for which made and for all plan years that begin less than five years thereafter, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all succeeding plan years until the premium payment year to which a revocation of the election first applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A revocation of an election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target for a plan must specify the premium payment year to which it first applies and must be filed by the plan's variable-rate premium due date for that premium payment year. The premium payment year to which the revocation first applies must begin at least five years after the beginning of the premium payment year to which the election first applied.
