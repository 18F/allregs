                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in specific exemptions, the minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor standards of the Act are generally applicable to employees who engage in specified activities concerned with interstate or foreign commerce. The employment of oppressive child labor in or about establishments producing goods for such commerce is also restricted by the Act. The monetary and child labor standards of the Act are also generally applicable to other employees, not specifically exempted, who are employed in specified enterprises engaged in such commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce. The employer must observe the monetary standards with respect to all such employees in his employ except those who may be denied one or both of these benefits by virtue of some specific exemption provision of the Act, such as section 13(a)(5) or 13(b)(4). It should be noted that enterprises having employees subject to these exemptions may also have other employees who may be exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, subject to conditions specified in regulations, as employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman. The regulations governing these exemptions are set forth and explained in part 541 of this chapter.</p>
