                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Diagnostic laboratories and other entities that possess, use, or transfer a select agent or toxin that is contained in a specimen presented for diagnosis or verification will be exempt from the requirements of this part for such agent or toxin contained in the specimen, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless directed otherwise by the Administrator, within 7 calendar days after identification, the agent or toxin is transferred in accordance with Sec. 331.16 or destroyed on-site by a recognized sterilization or inactivation process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agent or toxin is secured against theft, loss, or release during the period between identification of the agent or toxin and transfer or destruction of such agent or toxin, and any theft, loss, or release of such agent or toxin is reported; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The identification of the agent or toxin is immediately reported to APHIS or CDC by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. This report must be followed by submission of APHIS/CDC Form 4 within 7 calendar days after identification. Less stringent reporting may be required during agricultural emergencies or outbreaks, or in endemic areas. A copy of APHIS/CDC Form 4 must be maintained for 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator may grant a specific exemption upon a showing of good cause and upon his or her determination that such exemption is consistent with protecting plant health or plant products. An individual or entity may request in writing an exemption from the requirements of this part. If granted, such exemptions are valid for a maximum of 3 years; thereafter, an individual or entity must request a new exemption. If a request for exemption is denied, an individual or entity may request reconsideration in writing to the Administrator. The request for reconsideration must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the individual or entity relies to show that the exemption was wrongfully denied. The Administrator will grant or deny the request for reconsideration as promptly as circumstances allow and will state, in writing, the reasons for the decision.
