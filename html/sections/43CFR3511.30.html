Your obligation to pay any increased readjusted royalties, minimum  royalties and rentals will be suspended while your appeal is considered.  However, any increased charges accrue beginning with the effective date  of the readjustment or renewal, while final action on your appeal is  pending. If the increased charges are sustained on appeal, you must pay  the accrued balance, plus interest at the rate MMS specifies for late  payment in 30 CFR part 218.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 3512_Assignments and Subleases</p><p class="depth0">How to Assign Leases</p>
