                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A spirituous beverage that is imported directly from the territory of Canada and that is classifiable under subheading 2208.40 or 2208.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), will be entitled, upon entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, to duty-free treatment under section 213(a)(6) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(a)(6)), also known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), if the spirituous beverage has been produced in the territory of Canada from rum, provided that the rum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is the growth, product, or manufacture either of a beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Was imported directly into the territory of Canada from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Accounts for at least 90 percent of the alcoholic content by volume of the spirituous beverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Claim for exemption from duty under CBI. A claim for an exemption from duty for a spirituous beverage under section 213(a)(6) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(a)(6)) may be made by entering such beverage under subheading 9817.22.05, HTSUS, on the entry summary document or its electronic equivalent. In order to claim the exemption, the importer must have the records described in paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section so that, upon Customs request, the importer can establish that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rum used to produce the beverage is the growth, product or manufacture either of a beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rum was shipped directly from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Canada;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The beverage was produced in Canada;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The rum accounts for at least 90% of the alcohol content of the beverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The beverage was shipped directly from Canada to the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Imported directly. For a spirituous beverage imported from Canada to qualify for duty-free entry under the CBI, the spirituous beverage must be imported directly into the customs territory of the United States from Canada; and the rum used in its production must have been imported directly into the territory of Canada either from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Imported directly'' into the customs territory of the United States from Canada means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct shipment from the territory of Canada to the U.S. without passing through the territory of any other country; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the shipment is from the territory of Canada to the U.S. through the territory of any other country, the spirituous beverages do not enter into the commerce of any other country while en route to the U.S.; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the shipment is from the territory of Canada to the U.S. through the territory of another country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the U.S. as the final destination, the spirituous beverages in the shipment are imported directly only if they:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the port director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Were not subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the products in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Imported directly'' from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct shipment from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the shipment is from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the rum does not enter into the commerce of any non-beneficiary country while en route to Canada; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the shipment is from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the rum in the shipment is imported directly into the territory of Canada only if it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Was not subjected to operations in the intermediate country other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the product in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Evidence of direct shipment--(1) Spirituous beverages imported from Canada. The importer must be prepared to provide to the port director, if requested, documentary evidence that the spirituous beverages were imported

directly from the territory of Canada, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

In order for a spirituous beverage covered by this section to be entitled to duty-free entry under the CBI, the rum used in producing the spirituous beverage in the territory of Canada must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture either of a beneficiary country under the CBI or of the U.S. Virgin Islands, or must constitute a new or different article of commerce that was produced or manufactured in a beneficiary country or in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Such rum will not be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country or in the U.S. Virgin Islands by virtue of having merely undergone blending, combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Origin criteria.
