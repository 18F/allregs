Evidence of such interests include, but are not limited to, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, surety bonds and guarantees of obligations, title held pursuant to a lease financing transaction in which the lessor does not select initially the leased property (hereinafter ``lease financing transaction''), and legal or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure. Evidence of such interests also includes assignments, pledges, or other rights to or other forms of encumbrance against property that are held primarily to protect a security interest. A person is not required to hold title or a security interest in order to maintain indicia of ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A holder is a person who, upon the effective date of this regulation or in

the future, maintains indicia of ownership (as defined in Sec.  280.200(c)) primarily to protect a security interest (as defined in Sec.  280.200(f)(1)) in a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located.

Security interests may also arise from transactions such as sale and leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments, factoring agreements, accounts receivable financing arrangements, and consignments, if the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system or in the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Primarily to protect a security interest, as used in this subpart, does not include indicia of ownership held primarily for investment purposes, nor ownership indicia held primarily for purposes other than as protection for a security interest. A holder may have other, secondary reasons for maintaining indicia of ownership, but the primary reason why any ownership indicia are held must be as protection for a security interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Operation means, for purposes of this subpart, the use, storage, filling, or dispensing of petroleum contained in an UST or UST system.</p>
