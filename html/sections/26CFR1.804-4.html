                                Sec. 1.804-4  Investment yield of a life insurance company.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of  Sec. 1.804-3), less the deductions provided in section 804(c) and  paragraph (b) of this section for investment expenses, real estate  expenses, depreciation, depletion, and trade or business (other than an  insurance business) expenses. However, such expenses are deductible only  to the extent that they relate to investment income and the deduction of  such expenses is not disallowed by any other provision of subtitle A of  the Code. For example, investment expenses are not allowable unless they  are ordinary and necessary expenses within the meaning of section 162,  and under section 265, no deduction is allowable for interest on  indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations the  interest on which is wholly exempt from taxation under chapter 1 of the  Code. A deduction shall not be permitted with respect to the same item  more than once.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deductions from gross investment income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Investment  expenses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 804(c)(1) provides for the deduction of investment  expenses by a life insurance company in determining investment yield.  ``Investment expenses'' are those expenses of the taxable year which are  fairly chargeable against gross investment income. For example,  investment expenses include salaries and expenses paid exclusively for  work in looking after investments, and amounts expended for printing,  stationery, postage, and stenographic work incident to the collection of  interest. An itemized schedule of such expenses shall be attached to the  return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any assignment of general expenses to the investment department  of a life insurance company for which a deduction is claimed under  section 804(c)(1) subjects the entire deduction for investment expenses  to the limitation provided in that section and subdivision (iii) of this  subparagraph. As used in section 804(c)(1), the term general expenses  means any expense paid or incurred for the benefit of more than one  department of the company rather than for the benefit of a particular  department thereof. For example, if real estate taxes, depreciation, or  other expenses attributable to office space owned by the company and  utilized by it in connection with its investment function are assigned  to investment expenses, such items shall be deductible as general  expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such  shall be subject to the limitation of section 804(c)(1) and subdivision  (iii) of this subparagraph. Similarly, if an expense, such as a salary,  is attributable to more than one department, including the investment  department, such expense may be properly allocated among these  departments. If such expenses are allocated, the amount properly  allocable to the investment department shall be deductible as general   expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such  shall be subject to the limitation of section 804(c)(1) and subdivision  (iii) of this subparagraph. If general expenses are in part assigned to  or included in investment expenses, the maximum allowance (as determined  under section 804(c)(1)) shall not be granted unless it is shown to the  satisfaction of the district director that such allowance is justified  by a reasonable assignment of actual expenses. The accounting procedure  employed is not conclusive as to whether any assignment has in fact been  made. Investment expenses do not include Federal income and excess  profits taxes, if any. In cases where the investment expenses allowable  as deductions under section 804(c)(1) exceed the limitation contained  therein, see section 809(d)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If any general expenses are in part assigned to or included in  investment expenses, the total deduction under section 804(c)(1) shall  not exceed the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em> of Sec. 1.805-5) held at the  beginning and end of the taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the mortgage service fees for the taxable year,  plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Whichever of the following is the greater:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em> exceeds 3\3/4\ percent of the mean of the assets (as defined  in section 805(b)(4)) held at the beginning and end of the taxable year,  reduced by the amount of the mortgage service fees for the taxable year,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One-fourth of one percent of the mean of the value of mortgages  held at the beginning and end of the taxable year for which there are no  mortgage service fees for the taxable year. For purposes of the  preceding sentence, the term mortgages held refers to mortgages, and  other similar liens, on real property which are held by the company as  security for ``mortgage loans''.  For purposes of section 804(c)(1)(B) and (C)(i) and (b) and (c)(1) of  this subdivision, the term mortgage service fees includes mortgage  origination fees. Such mortgage origination fees shall be amortized in  accordance with the rules prescribed in section 818(b) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The operation of the limitation contained in section 804(c)(1)  and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The books of S, a life insurance company, reflect the  following items for the taxable year 1958:  Investment expenses (including general expenses assigned        $125,000</p><p class="depth0">to or included in investment expenses)................... Mean of the assets held at the beginning and end of the       20,000,000</p><p class="depth0">taxable year.............................................

Mean of the assets held at the beginning    $20,000,000</p><p class="depth0">and end of the taxable year................</p><p class="depth0">--------------- 2.

Limitation on investment expenses (items 2, 3, and            162,500</p><p class="depth0">4(a))....................................................</p><p class="depth0">As the investment expenses (including general expenses assigned to or  included in investment expenses) of S for the taxable year 1958  ($125,000) do not exceed the limitation on such expenses ($162,500), S  would be entitled to deduct the entire $125,000 under section 804(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> for  any amount paid out for new buildings, or for permanent improvements or  betterments made to increase the value of any property. An itemized  schedule of such taxes and expenses shall be attached to the return. See  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for limitation of such deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph,  identical to that allowed other corporations by section 167. Such amount  allowed as a deduction from gross investment income in determining  investment yield is limited to depreciation sustained on the property  used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income  specified in section 804(b). An election with respect to any of the  methods of depreciation provided in section 167 shall not be affected in  any way by the enactment of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of  1959 (73 Stat. 112). However, in appropriate cases, the method of  depreciation may be changed with the consent of the Commissioner. See  section 167(e) and Sec. 1.167(e)-1. See subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph for limitation of such deduction. See section 809(d)(12) and  the regulations thereunder for the treatment of depreciable property  used in the operation of a life insurance business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on deductions allowable under section 804 (c)(2) and  (c)(3). Section 804(c)(3) provides that the amount allowable as a  deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation on or with respect to  any real estate owned and occupied for insurance purposes in whole or in  part by a life insurance company shall be limited to an amount which  bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to this  limitation) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears to  the rental value of the entire property. For example, T, a life  insurance company, owns a twenty-story downtown home office building.  The rental value of each floor of the building is identical. T rents  nine floors to various tenants, one floor is utilized by it in operating  its investment department, and the remaining ten floors are occupied by  it in carrying on its insurance business. Since floor space equivalent  to eleven-twentieths, or 55 percent, of the rental value of the entire  property is owned and occupied for insurance purposes by the company,  the deductions allowable under section 804(c)(2) and (3) for taxes,  depreciation, and other real estate expenses shall be limited to nine- twentieths, or 45 percent, of the taxes, depreciation, and other real  estate expenses on account of the entire property. However, the portion  of such allowable deductions attributable to the operation of the  investment department (one-twentieth, or 5 percent) may be deductible as  general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as  such shall be subject to the limitations of section 804(c)(1). Where a  deduction is claimed as provided in this section, the parts of the  property occupied and the parts not occupied by the company in carrying  on its insurance business, together with the respective rental values  thereof, must be shown in a schedule accompanying the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Depletion. The deduction for depletion (and depreciation)  provided in section 804(c)(4) is identical to that allowed other  corporations by section 611. The amount allowed by section 611 in the  case of a life insurance company is limited to depletion (and  depreciation) sustained on the property used, and to the extent used,  for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 804(b). See  section 611 and Sec. 1.611-5 for special rules relating to the  depreciation of improvements in the case of mines, oil and gas wells,  other natural deposits, and timber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Trade or business deductions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under section 804(c)(5), the  deductions allowed by subtitle A of the Code (without regard to this  part) which are   attributable to any trade or business (other than an insurance business)  carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership of which  the life insurance company is a partner are, subject to the limitations  in subdivisions (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, allowable as  deductions from the gross investment income of a life insurance company  in determining its investment yield. Such deductions are allowable,  however, only to the extent that they are attributable to the production  of income which is included in the life insurance company's gross  investment income by reason of section 804(b)(3). However, since any  interest, dividends, rents, and royalties received by any trade or  business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the life  insurance company, or by a partnership of which the life insurance  company is a partner, is included in the life insurance company's gross  investment income by reason of section 804(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of  Sec. 1.804-3, any expenses fairly chargeable against the production of  such income may be deductible under section 804(c) (1), (2), (3), or  (4). The allowable deductions may exceed the gross income from such  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In computing the deductions under section 804(c)(5), there  shall be excluded losses:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> From (or considered as from) sales or exchanges of capital  assets,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b))</em>, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> From the compulsory or involuntary conversion (as a result of  destruction, in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an exercise of  the power of requisition or condemnation or the threat or imminence  thereof) of property used in the trade or business (as so defined).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any item, to the extent attributable to the carrying on of the  insurance business, shall not be taken into account. For example, if a  life insurance company operates a radio station primarily to advertise  its own insurance services, a portion of the expenses of the radio  station shall not be allowed as a deduction. The portion disallowed  shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total expenses of  the station as the value of advertising furnished to the insurance  company bears to the total value of services rendered by the station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The deduction for net operating losses provided in section 172,  and the special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII,  subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, shall not be allowed.
