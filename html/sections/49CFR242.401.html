The document explaining the basis for the  denial shall be served on the person within 10 days after the railroad's  decision and shall give the date of the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A railroad shall not deny the person's certification for failing  to comply with a railroad operating rule or practice which constitutes a  violation under Sec. 242.403(e)(1) through (11) of this part if  sufficient evidence exists to establish that an intervening cause  prevented or materially impaired the conductor's ability to comply with  that railroad operating rule or practice.</p>
