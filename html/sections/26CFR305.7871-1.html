An Indian tribal  government shall be treated as a State, and a subdivision of an Indian  tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a  State, for purposes of any exemption from, credit or refund of, or  payment with respect to, an excise tax imposed on a transaction under--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chapter 31 of the Code (relating to tax on special fuels);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chapter 32 of the Code (relating to manufacturers excise taxes);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subchapter B of chapter 33 of the Code (relating to  communications excise tax); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subchapter D of chapter 36 of the Code (relating to tax on use  of certain highway vehicles), if, in addition to satisfying all  requirements applicable to a similar transaction involving a State (or  political subdivision thereof)   under the Code, the transaction involves the exercise of an essential  governmental function of the Indian tribal government, as defined in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rule for tax-exempt bonds. An Indian tribal government  shall be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal  government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for  purposes of any obligation issued by such government or subdivision  under section 103 (relating to interest on certain governmental  obligations) if such obligation is part of an issue substantially all of  the proceeds of which are to be used in the exercise of an essential  governmental function, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. For  purposes of section 7871 and this section, the ``substantially all''  test is the same as that provided in Sec. 1.103-8(a)(1)(i). An Indian  tribal government shall not be treated as a State and a subdivision of  an Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a political  subdivision of a State, however, for issues of the following private  activity bonds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An industrial development bond (as defined in section  103(b)(2));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An obligation described in section 103(l)(1)(A) (relating to  scholarship bonds); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A mortgage subsidy bond (as defined in section 103A(b)(1),  without regard to section 103A(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Essential governmental function. For purposes of section 7871  and this section, an essential governmental function of an Indian tribal  government (or portion thereof) is a function of a type which is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. 13 and the regulations  thereunder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450 (f), (g),  and (h) and the regulations thereunder; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An essential governmental function under section 115 and the  regulations thereunder when conducted by a State or political  subdivision thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of subdivisions of Indian tribal governments as  political subdivisions. A subdivision of an Indian tribal government  shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of  section 7871 and this section if the Internal Revenue Service determines  that the subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or  more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal  government. Designation of a subdivision of an Indian tribal government  as a political subdivision of a State will be by revenue procedure. If a  subdivision of an Indian tribal government is not currently designated  by the applicable revenue procedure as a political subdivision of a  State, and such subdivision believes that it qualifies for such  designation, the subdivision may apply for a ruling from the Internal  Revenue Service. In order to qualify as a political subdivision of a  State, for purposes of section 7871 and this section, such subdivision  must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The  request for a ruling shall be made in accordance with all applicable  procedural rules set forth in the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR  part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures relating to submission  of ruling requests. The request shall be submitted to the Internal  Revenue Service, Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), Attention:  CC:IND:S, Room 6545, 1111 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, D.C.  20224.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.
