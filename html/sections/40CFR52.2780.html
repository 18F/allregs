                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since there has not been a satisfactory demonstration that the Virgin Islands plan provides for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards for sulfur oxides on the island of St. Croix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following parts of regulation 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, ``Sulfur Compounds Emission Control,'' as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976 are approved:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The entire regulation as it applies to the islands of St. Thomas and St. John.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entire regulation as it applies to the Virgin Islands Water and Power

Subsection (a)(2) of the regulation is not approved as it applies to the remaining sources on St. Croix because of the inadequacy of the control strategy demonstration noted in paragraph (a) of this section. Accordingly, all sources on St. Croix with the exception of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant are required to conform to the sulfur-in-fuel-oil limitations contained in 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference to ``Section (a)(2)'' in subsection (d) of 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976, refers to the following approved limitations: (1) For the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976; (2) for the island of St. Croix, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972 and approved by EPA on May 31, 1972.
