                            <p class="depth0">510.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and  assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget for the Prototype or  Reference Building and the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy  Cost of the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between  the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions  to be used are stated below. These inputs shall be used to determine the  Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Consumption.</p><p class="depth0">510.2 Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation.  Default assumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate  that a different assumption better characterizes the building's energy  use over its expected life. The default assumptions shall be used in  modeling both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed  Design, unless the designer demonstrates clear cause to modify these  assumptions. Special procedures for speculative buildings are discussed  in subsection 503. Shell buildings may not use subpart E.</p>
