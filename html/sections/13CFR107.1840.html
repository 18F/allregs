                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section contains the procedures you must use to determine your Capital Impairment Percentage if you have outstanding Leverage issued after April 25, 1994. You must compare your Capital Impairment Percentage to the maximum permitted under Sec. 107.1830(c) to determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preliminary impairment test. If you satisfy the preliminary impairment test, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero and you do not have to perform any more procedures in this Sec. 107.1840. Otherwise, you must continue with paragraph (c) of this section. You satisfy the test if the following amounts are both zero or greater:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sum of Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, as reported on SBA Form 468, and Includible Non-Cash Gains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Securities Held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How to compute your Capital Impairment Percentage. (1) If you have an Unrealized Gain on Securities Held, compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain using paragraph (d) of this section. If you have an Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, continue with paragraph (c)(2) of this Section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you have an Unrealized Gain on Securities Held, compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain using paragraph (d) of this section. If you have an Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, continue with paragraph (c)(2) of this Section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add together your Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, your Includible Non-cash Gains, and either your Unrealized Loss on Securities Held or your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is zero or greater, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is less than zero, drop the negative sign, divide by your Regulatory Capital (excluding Treasury Stock), and multiply by 100. The result is your Capital Impairment Percentage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> How to compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain. (1) Subtract Unrealized Depreciation from Unrealized Appreciation. This is your ``Net Appreciation''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subtract Unrealized Depreciation from Unrealized Appreciation.
