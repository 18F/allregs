Sec.  1.42-1T  Limitation on low-income housing credit allowed with respect to qualified low-income buildings receiving housing creditallocations from a State or local housing credit agency (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Determination of amount of low-income housing credit. Section 42 provides that, for purposes of section 38, a low-income housing credit is determined for a building in an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the qualified basis of the qualified low-income building. In general, the credit may be claimed annually for a 10-year credit period, beginning with the taxable year in which the building is placed in service or, at the election of the taxpayer, the succeeding taxable year. If, after the first year of the credit period, the qualified basis of a building is increased in excess of the qualified basis upon which the credit was initially determined, the allowable credit with respect to such additional qualified basis is determined using a credit percentage equal to two-thirds of the applicable percentage for the initial qualified basis. The credit for additions to qualified basis is generally allowable for the remaining years in the 15-year compliance period which begins with the first taxable year of the credit period for the building. In general, the low-income housing credit is available with respect to buildings placed in service after December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending after that date. See section 42 for the definitions of ``qualified low-income building'', ``applicable percentage'', ``qualified basis'', ``credit period'', ``compliance period'', and for other rules relating to determination of the amount of the low-income housing credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of amount of low-income housing credit.

See section 42 for the definitions of ``qualified low-income building'', ``applicable percentage'', ``qualified basis'', ``credit period'', ``compliance period'', and for other rules relating to determination of the amount of the low-income housing credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on low-income housing credit allowed. Generally, the low-income housing credit determined under section 42 is allowed and may be claimed for any taxable year if, and to the extent that, the owner of a qualified low-income building receives a housing credit allocation from a State or local housing credit agency. The aggregate amount of housing credit allocations that may be made in any calendar year by all housing credit agencies within a State is limited by a State housing credit ceiling, or volume cap, described in paragraph (b) of this section. The authority to make housing credit allocations within the State housing credit ceiling may be apportioned among the State and local housing credit agencies, under the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. Upon apportionment of the State housing credit volume cap, each State or local housing credit agency receives an aggregate housing credit dollar amount that may be used to make housing credit allocations among qualified low-income buildings located within an agency's geographic jurisdiction. The rules governing the making of housing credit allocations by any state or local housing credit agency are provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Housing credit allocations are required to be taken into account by owners of qualified low-income buildings under the rules prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section. Exceptions to the requirement that a qualified low-income building receive a housing credit allocation from a State or local housing credit agency are provided in paragraph (f) of this section. Rules regarding termination of the authority of State and local housing credit agencies to make housing credit allocations after December 31, 1989, are specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Rules concerning information reporting by State and local housing credit agencies and owners of qualified low-income buildings are provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Special statutory transitional rules are incorporated into this section of the regulations as described in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The State housing credit ceiling. The aggregate amount of housing credit allocations that may be made in any calendar year by all State and local housing credit agencies within a State may not exceed the State's housing credit ceiling for such calendar year. The State housing credit ceiling for each State for any calendar year is equal to $1.25 multiplied by the State's population. A State's population for

any calendar year is determined by reference to the most recent census estimate (whether final or provisional) of the resident population of the State released by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of the calendar year for which the State's housing credit ceiling is set. Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable revenue procedure, determinations of population are based on the most recent estimates of population contained in the Bureau of the Census publication, ``Current Population Reports, Series P-25: Population Estimates and Projections, Estimates of the Population of States''. For purposes of this section, the District of Columbia and United States possessions are treated as States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Apportionment of State housing credit ceiling among State and local housing credit agencies--(1) In general. A State's housing credit ceiling for any calendar year is apportioned among the State and local housing credit agencies within such State under the rules prescribed in this paragraph. A ``State housing credit agency'' is any State agency specifically authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute to make housing credit allocations on behalf of the State and to carry out the provisions of section 42(h). A ``local housing credit agency'' is any agency of a political subdivision of the State that is specifically authorized by a State enabling act to make housing credit allocations on behalf of the State or political subdivision and to carry out the provisions of section 42(h). A ``State enabling act'' is any gubernatorial act, State statute, or State housing credit agency regulation (if authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute). A State enabling act enacted on or before October 22, 1986, the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, shall be given effect for purposes of this paragraph if such State enabling act expressly carries out the provisions of section 42(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A State's housing credit ceiling for any calendar year is apportioned among the State and local housing credit agencies within such State under the rules prescribed in this paragraph. A ``State housing credit agency'' is any State agency specifically authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute to make housing credit allocations on behalf of the State and to carry out the provisions of section 42(h). A ``local housing credit agency'' is any agency of a political subdivision of the State that is specifically authorized by a State enabling act to make housing credit allocations on behalf of the State or political subdivision and to carry out the provisions of section 42(h). A ``State enabling act'' is any gubernatorial act, State statute, or State housing credit agency regulation (if authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute). A State enabling act enacted on or before October 22, 1986, the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, shall be given effect for purposes of this paragraph if such State enabling act expressly carries out the provisions of section 42(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Primary apportionment. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) (3) and (4) of this section, a State's housing credit ceiling is apportioned in its entirety to the State housing credit agency. Such an apportionment is the ``primary apportionment'' of a State's housing credit ceiling. There shall be no primary apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling and no grants of housing credit allocations in such State until a State housing credit agency is authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute. If a State has more than one State housing credit agency, such agencies shall be treated as a single agency for purposes of the primary apportionment. In such a case, the State housing credit ceiling may be divided among the multiple State housing credit agencies pursuant to gubernatorial act or State statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> States with 1 or more constitutional home rule cities--(i) In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in any State with 1 or more constitutional home rule cities, a portion of the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned to each constitutional home rule city. In such a State, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remainder of the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned to the State housing credit agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. The term ``constitutional home rule city'' means, with respect to any calendar year, any political subdivision of a State that, under a State constitution that was adopted in 1970 and effective on July 1, 1971, had home rule powers on the first day of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in any State with 1 or more constitutional home rule cities, a portion of the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned to each constitutional home rule city. In such a State, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remainder of the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned to the State housing credit agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. The term ``constitutional home rule city'' means, with respect to any calendar year, any political subdivision of a State that, under a State constitution that was adopted in 1970 and effective on July 1, 1971, had home rule powers on the first day of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of apportionment to a constitutional home rule city. The amount of the State housing credit ceiling apportioned to a constitutional home rule city for any calendar year is an amount that bears the same ratio to the State housing credit ceiling for that year as the population of the constitutional home rule city bears to the population of the entire State. The population of any constitutional home rule city for any calendar year is determined by reference to the most recent census estimate (whether final or provisional) of the resident population of the constitutional home rule city released by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of the calendar year for which the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned. However, determinations of the population of a constitutional home rule city may not be based on Bureau of the Census estimates that do not contain estimates

for all of the constitutional home rule cities within the State. If no Bureau of the Census estimate is available for all such constitutional home rule cities, the most recent decennial census of population shall be relied on. Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable revenue procedure, determinations of population for constitutional home rule cities are based on estimates of population contained in the Bureau of the Census publication, ``Current Population Reports, Series P-26: Local Population Estimates''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of apportionments to constitutional home rule cities on apportionments to other housing credit agencies. The aggregate amounts of the State housing credit ceiling apportioned to constitutional home rule cities under this paragraph (c)(3) reduce the State housing credit ceiling available for apportionment under paragraph (c) (2) or (4) of this section. Unless otherwise provided in a State constitutional amendment or by law changing the home rule provisions adopted in a manner provided by the State constitution, the power of the governor or State legislature to apportion the State housing credit ceiling among local housing credit agencies under paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall not be construed as allowing any reduction of the portion of the State housing credit ceiling apportioned to a constitutional home rule city under this paragraph (c)(3). However, any constitutional home rule city may agree to a reduction in its apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c)(3), in which case the amount of the State housing credit ceiling not apportioned to the constitutional home rule city shall be available for apportionment under paragraph (c) (2) or (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of governmental authority within constitutional home rule city. For purposes of determining which agency within a constitutional home rule city receives the apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c)(3), the rules of this paragraph (c) shall be applied by treating the constitutional home rule city as a ``State'', the chief executive officer of a constitutional home rule city as a ``governor'', and a city council as a ``State legislature''. A constitutional home rule city is also treated as a ``State'' for purposes of the set-aside requirement for housing credit allocations to projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for rules governing set-aside requirements. In this connection, a constitutional home rule city may agree with the State housing credit agency to exchange an apportionment set aside for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization for an apportionment that is not so restricted. In such a case, the authorizing gubernatorial act, State statute, or State housing credit agency regulation (if authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute) must ensure that the set-aside apportionment transferred to the State housing credit agency be used for the purposes described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Apportionment to local housing credit agencies--(i) In general. In lieu of the primary apportionment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all or a portion of the State housing credit ceiling may be apportioned among housing credit agencies of governmental subdivisions. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling to local housing credit agencies must be made pursuant to a State enabling act as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling may be made to housing credit agencies of constitutional home rule cities under this paragraph (c)(4), in addition to apportionments made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c)(4) need not be based on the population of political subdivisions and may, but are not required to, give balanced consideration to the low-income housing needs of the entire State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In lieu of the primary apportionment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all or a portion of the State housing credit ceiling may be apportioned among housing credit agencies of governmental subdivisions. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling to local housing credit agencies must be made pursuant to a State enabling act as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling may be made to housing credit agencies of constitutional home rule cities under this paragraph (c)(4), in addition to apportionments made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c)(4) need not be based on the population of political subdivisions and may, but are not required to, give balanced consideration to the low-income housing needs of the entire State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in apportionments during a calendar year. The apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling among State and local housing credit agencies under this paragraph (c)(4) may be changed after the beginning of a calendar year, pursuant to a State enabling act. No change in apportionments shall retroactively reduce the housing credit allocations made by any agency during such year. Any change in the

apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c)(4) that occurs during a calendar year is effective only to the extent housing credit agencies have not previously made housing credit allocations during such year from their original apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling for such year. To the extent apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling to local housing credit agencies made pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) for any calendar year are not used by such local agencies before a certain date (e.g., November 1) to make housing credit allocations in such year, the amount of unused apportionments may revert back to the State housing credit agency for reapportionment. Such reversion must be specifically authorized by the State enabling act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exchanges of apportionments. Any State or local housing credit agency that receives an apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year under this paragraph (c)(4) may exchange part or all of such apportionment with another State or local housing credit agency to the extent no housing credit allocations have been made in such year from the exchanged portions. Such exchanges must be made with another housing credit agency in the same State and must be consistent with the State enabling act. If an apportionment set aside for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization is transferred or exchanged, the transferee housing credit agency shall be required to use the set-aside apportionment for the purposes described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Written records of apportionments. All apportionments, exchanges of apportionments, and reapportionments of the State housing credit ceiling which are authorized by this paragraph (c)(4) must be evidenced in the written records maintained by each State and local housing credit agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Set-aside apportionments for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization--(i) In general. Ten percent of the State housing credit ceiling for a calendar year must be set aside exclusively for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section). Thus, at least 10 percent of apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section must be used only to make housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. In the case of apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the State enabling act must ensure that the apportionment of at least 10 percent of the State housing credit ceiling be used exclusively to make housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. The State enabling act shall prescribe which housing credit agencies in the State receive apportionments that must be set aside for making housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. These set-aside apportionments may be distributed disproportionately among the State or local housing credit agencies receiving apportionments under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The 10-percent set-aside requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) is a minimum requirement, and the State enabling act may set aside more than 10 percent of the State housing credit ceiling for apportionment to housing credit agencies for exclusive use in making housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Ten percent of the State housing credit ceiling for a calendar year must be set aside exclusively for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section). Thus, at least 10 percent of apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section must be used only to make housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. In the case of apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the State enabling act must ensure that the apportionment of at least 10 percent of the State housing credit ceiling be used exclusively to make housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. The State enabling act shall prescribe which housing credit agencies in the State receive apportionments that must be set aside for making housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. These set-aside apportionments may be distributed disproportionately among the State or local housing credit agencies receiving apportionments under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The 10-percent set-aside requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) is a minimum requirement, and the State enabling act may set aside more than 10 percent of the State housing credit ceiling for apportionment to housing credit agencies for exclusive use in making housing credit allocations to buildings that are part of projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization. The term ``projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization'' means projects with respect to which a qualified nonprofit organization is to materially participate (within the meaning of section 469(h)) in the development and continuing operation of the project throughout the 15-year compliance period. The term ``qualified nonprofit organization'' means any organization that is described in section 501(c) (3) or (4), is exempt from tax under section 501(a), and includes as one of its exempt purposes the fostering of low-income housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Expiration of unused apportionments. Apportionments of the State housing credit ceiling under this paragraph (c) for any calendar year may be

used by housing credit agencies to make housing credit allocations only in such calendar year. Any part of an apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year that is not used for housing credit allocations in such year expires as of the end of such year and does not carry over to any other year. However, any part of an apportionment for 1989 that is not used to make a housing credit allocation in 1989 may be carried over to 1990 and used to make a housing credit allocation to a qualified low-income building described in section 42(n)(2)(B). See paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Housing credit allocations made by State and local housing credit agencies--(1) In general. This paragraph governs State and local housing credit agencies in making housing credit allocations to qualified low-income buildings. The amount of the apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year received by any State or local housing credit agency under paragraph (c) of this section constitutes the agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for such year. The aggregate amount of housing credit allocations made in any calendar year by a State or local housing credit agency may not exceed such agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for such year. A State or local housing credit agency may make housing credit allocations only to qualified low-income buildings located within the agency's geographic jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph governs State and local housing credit agencies in making housing credit allocations to qualified low-income buildings. The amount of the apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year received by any State or local housing credit agency under paragraph (c) of this section constitutes the agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for such year. The aggregate amount of housing credit allocations made in any calendar year by a State or local housing credit agency may not exceed such agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for such year. A State or local housing credit agency may make housing credit allocations only to qualified low-income buildings located within the agency's geographic jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of a housing credit allocation. In making a housing credit allocation, a State or local housing credit agency must specify a credit percentage, not to exceed the building's applicable percentage determined under section 42(b), and a qualified basis amount. The amount of the housing credit allocation for any building is the product of the specified credit percentage and the specified qualified basis amount. In specifying the credit percentage and qualified basis amount, the State or local housing credit agency shall not take account of the first-year conventions described in section 42(f) (2)(A) and (3)(B). A State or local housing credit agency may adopt rules or regulations governing conditions for specification of less than the maximum credit percentage and qualified basis amount allowable under section 42 (b) and (c), respectively. For example, an agency may specify a credit percentage and a qualified basis amount of less than the maximum credit percentage and qualified basis amount allowable under section 42 (b) and (c), respectively, when the financing and rental assistance from all sources for the project of which the building is a part is sufficient to provide the continuing operation of the building without the maximum credit amount allowable under section 42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Counting housing credit allocations against an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. The aggregate amount of housing credit allocations made in any calendar year by a State or local housing credit agency may not exceed such agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount (i.e., the agency's apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for such year). This limitation on the aggregate dollar amount of housing credit allocations shall be computed separately for set-aside apportionments received pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Housing credit allocations count against an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount without regard to the amount of credit allowable to or claimed by an owner of a building in the taxable year in which the allocation is made or in any subsequent year. Thus, housing credit allocations (which are computed without regard to the first-year conventions as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) count in full against an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount, even though the first-year conventions described in section 42(f) (2)(A) and (3)(B) may reduce the amount of credit claimed by a taxpayer in the first year in which a credit is allowable. See also paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Housing credit allocations count against an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount only in the calendar year in which made and not in subsequent taxable years in the credit period or compliance period during which a taxpayer may claim a credit based on the original housing credit allocation. Since the

aggregate amount of housing credit allocations made in any calendar year by a State or local housing credit agency may not exceed such agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount, an agency shall at all times during a calendar year maintain a record of its cumulative allocations made during such year and its remaining unused aggregate housing credit dollar amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules for when applications for housing credit allocations exceed an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. A State or local housing credit agency may adopt rules or regulations governing the awarding of housing credit allocations when an agency expects that applicants during a calendar year will seek aggregate allocations in excess of the agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. The State enabling act may provide uniform standards for the awarding of housing credit allocations when there is actual or anticipated excess demand from applicants in any calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reduced or additional housing credit allocations--(i) In general. A State or local housing credit agency may not reduce or rescind a housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. Thus, a housing credit agency may not reduce or rescind a housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building which is acquired by a new owner who is entitled to a carryover of the allowable credit for such building under section 42(d)(7). A housing credit agency may make additional housing credit allocations to a building in any year in the building's compliance period, whether or not there are additions to qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3). Each additional housing credit allocation made to a building is treated as a separate allocation and is subject to the rules and requirements of this section. However, in the case of an additional housing credit allocation made with respect to additions to qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3), the amount of the allocation that counts against the agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount shall be computed as if the specified credit percentage were unreduced in the manner prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(A) and the specified qualified basis amount were unreduced by the first-year convention prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A State or local housing credit agency may not reduce or rescind a housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. Thus, a housing credit agency may not reduce or rescind a housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building which is acquired by a new owner who is entitled to a carryover of the allowable credit for such building under section 42(d)(7). A housing credit agency may make additional housing credit allocations to a building in any year in the building's compliance period, whether or not there are additions to qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3). Each additional housing credit allocation made to a building is treated as a separate allocation and is subject to the rules and requirements of this section. However, in the case of an additional housing credit allocation made with respect to additions to qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3), the amount of the allocation that counts against the agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount shall be computed as if the specified credit percentage were unreduced in the manner prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(A) and the specified qualified basis amount were unreduced by the first-year convention prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For 1987, the County L Housing Credit Agency has an aggregate housing credit dollar amount of $2 million. D, an individual, places in service on July 1, 1987, a new qualified low-income building. As of the close of each month in 1987 in which the building is in service, the building consists of 100 residential rental units, of which 20 units are both rent-restricted and occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median gross income. The total floor space of the residential rental units is 120,000 square feet, and the total floor space of the low-income units is 20,000 square feet. The building is not Federally subsidized within the meaning of section 42(i)(2). As of the end of 1987, the building has eligible basis under section 42(d) of $1 million. Thus, the qualified basis of the building determined without regard to the first-year convention provided in section 42(f) is $166,666.67 (i.e., $1 million eligible basis times \1/6\, the floor space fraction which is required to be used instead of the larger unit fraction). However, the amount of the low-income housing credit determined for 1987 under section 42 reflects the first-year convention provided in section 42(f)(2). Since the building has the same floor space and unit fractions as of the close of each of the six months in 1987 during which it is in service, upon applying the first-year convention in section 42(f)(2), the qualified basis of the building in 1987 is $83,333.33 (i.e., $1 million eligible basis times \1/12\, the fraction determined under section 42(f)(2)(A)). Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the County L Housing Credit Agency may make a housing credit allocation by specifying a credit percentage, not to exceed 9 percent, and a qualified basis amount, which may be greater or less than the qualified basis of the building in 1987 as determined under section 42(c), without regard to the first-year convention provided in section 42(f)(2). If the County L Housing Credit Agency specifies a credit percentage of 8 percent and a qualified basis amount of $100,000, the amount of the housing credit allocation is $8,000. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the County L Housing Credit Agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for 1987 is reduced by $8,000, notwithstanding that D is entitled to claim less than $8,000 of the credit in 1987 under the rules in paragraph (e) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, in 1987 D is entitled to claim only $4,000 of

the credit, determined by applying the first-year convention of \6/12\ to the specified qualified basis amount contained in the housing credit allocation (i.e., .08x$100,000x(\6/12\)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that on July 1, 1988, the number of occupied low-income units increases to 50 units and the floor space of the occupied low-income units increases to 48,000 square feet. These occupancy fractions remain unchanged as of the close of each month remaining in 1988. Under section 42(c), the qualified basis of the building in 1988, without regard to the first-year convention in section 42(f)(3)(B), is $400,000 (i.e., $1 million eligible basis times .4, the floor space fraction which is required to be used instead of the larger unit fraction). D's 1987 housing credit allocation from the County L Housing Credit Agency remains effective in 1988 and entitles D to a credit of $8,000 (i.e., .08, the specified credit percentage, times $100,000, the specified qualified basis amount). With respect to the additional $300,000 of qualified basis which the 1987 housing credit allocation does not cover, D must apply to the County L Housing Credit Agency for an additional housing credit allocation. Assume that the County L Housing Credit Agency has a sufficient aggregate housing credit dollar amount for 1988 to make a housing credit allocation to D in 1988 by specifying a credit percentage of 9 percent and a qualified basis amount of $300,000. The amount of the housing credit allocation that counts against the County L Housing Credit Agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount is $27,000 (i.e., the amount counted (.09 times $300,000) is unreduced in the manner prescribed in section 42(f)(3) (A) and (B)). Since D's qualified basis in 1987 was $166,666.67, D is entitled to claim a credit in 1988 with respect to such basis of $14,000 (i.e., .08x$100,000, the 1987 credit allocation, +.09x$66,666.67, the 1988 credit allocation). In addition, D is entitled to claim a credit in 1988 and subsequent years in the 15-year compliance period with respect to the additional $233,333.33 of qualified basis covered by the 1988 housing credit allocation. However, the allowable credit for 1988 with respect to this amount of additional qualified basis is subject to reductions prescribed in section 42(f)(3) (A) and (B). Thus, D is entitled in 1988 to a credit at a 6-percent rate applied to $116,666.67 of additional qualified basis, which is reduced to reflect the first-year convention. D's total allowable low-income housing credit in 1988 is $21,000 (i.e., $14,000 with respect to original qualified basis + $7,000 with respect to 1988 additions to qualified basis). If the County L Housing Credit Agency had specified an 8-percent credit percentage in 1988 with respect to the qualified basis not covered by the 1987 housing credit allocation to D, D's allowable credit with respect to the $233,333.33 of additions to qualified basis would not exceed, in 1988 and subsequent years, an amount determined by applying a specified credit percentage of 5.33 percent (i.e., two-thirds of 8 percent). In 1988, D's specified qualified basis amount would be adjusted for the first-year convention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No carryover of unused aggregate housing credit dollar amount. Any portion of a State or local housing credit agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount for any calendar year that is not used to make a housing credit allocation in such year may not be carried over to any other year, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. An agency may not permit owners of qualified low-income buildings to transfer housing credit allocations to other buildings. However, an agency may provide a procedure whereby owners may return to the agency, prior to the end of the calendar year in which housing credit allocations are made, unusable portions of such allocations. In such a case, an owner's housing credit allocation is deemed reduced by the amount of the allocation returned to the agency, and the agency may reallocate such amount to other qualified low-income buildings prior to the end of the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Effect of housing credit allocations in excess of an agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. In the event that a State or local housing credit agency makes housing credit allocations in excess of its aggregate housing credit dollar amount for any calendar year, the allocations shall be deemed reduced (to the extent of such excess) for buildings in the reverse order in which such allocations were made during such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Time and manner for making housing credit allocations--(i) Time. Housing credit allocations are effective for the calendar year in which made in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section. A State or local housing credit agency may not make a housing credit allocation to a qualified low-income building prior to the calendar year in which such building is placed in service. An agency may adopt its own procedures for receiving applications for housing credit allocations from owners of qualified low-income buildings. An agency may provide a procedure for making, in advance of a

building's being placed in service, a binding commitment (e.g., by contract, inducement, resolution, or other means) to make a housing credit allocation in the calendar year in which a qualified low-income building is placed in service or in a subsequent calendar year.

Housing credit allocations are deemed made when part I of IRS Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation Certification, is completed and signed by an authorized official of the housing credit agency and mailed to the owner of the qualified low-income building. A copy of all completed (as to part I) Form 8609 allocations along with a single completed Form 8610, Annual Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report, must also be mailed to the Internal Revenue Service not later than the 28th day of the second calendar month after the close of the calendar year in which the housing credit was allocated to the qualified low-income building.

See paragraph (h) of this section for additional rules concerning filing of forms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certification. The certifying official for the State or local housing credit agency need not perform an independent investigation of the qualified low-income building in order to certify on part I of Form 8609 that the housing credit allocation meets the requirements of section 42(h). For example, the certifying official may rely on information contained in an application for a low-income housing credit allocation submitted by the building owner which sets forth facts necessary to determine that the building is eligible for the low-income housing credit under section 42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fee. A State or local housing credit agency may charge building owners applying for housing credit allocations a reasonable fee to cover the agency's administrative expenses for processing applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No continuing agency responsibility.

An owner of a qualified low-income building may not claim a low-income housing credit determined under section 42 in any year in excess of an effective housing credit allocation received from a State or local housing credit agency. A housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building is effective with respect to any owner of the building beginning with the owner's taxable year in which the housing credit allocation is received. A housing credit allocation is deemed received in a taxable year, except as modified in the succeeding sentence, if that allocation is made (in the manner described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section) not later than the earlier of (i) the 60th day after the close of the taxable year, or (ii) the close of the

calendar year in which such taxable year ends. A housing credit allocation is deemed received in a taxable year ending in 1987, if such allocation is made (in the manner described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section) on or before December 31, 1987. A housing credit allocation is not effective for any taxable year if received in a calendar year which ends prior to when the qualified low-income building is placed in service.

A housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building remains effective for all taxable years in the compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> First-year convention limitation on housing credit allocation taken into account. For purposes of the limitation that the allowable low-income housing credit may not exceed the effective housing credit allocation received from a State or local housing credit agency, as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the amount of the effective housing credit allocation shall be adjusted by applying the first-year convention provided in section 42(f)(2)(A) and (3)(B) and the percentage credit reduction provided in section 42(f)(3)(A). Under paragraphs (d) (2) and (5) of this section, the State or local housing credit agency must specify the credit percentage and qualified basis amount, the product of which is the amount of the housing credit allocation, without taking account of the first-year convention described in section 42(f)(2)(A) and (3)(B) or the percentage credit reduction prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(A). However, for purposes of the limitation on the amount of the allowable low-income housing credit, as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, in a taxable year in which the first-year convention applies to the amount of credit determined under section 42(a), the specified qualified basis amount shall be adjusted by the first-year convention fraction which is equal to the number of full months (during the first taxable year) in which the building was in service divided by 12. In addition, for purposes of the limitation on the amount of the allowable low-income housing credit, as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, in a taxable year in which the reduction in credit percentage applies to additions to qualified basis, as prescribed in section 42(f)(3), the specified credit percentage shall be reduced by one-third.

If the housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building exceeds the amount of credit allowable with respect to such building in any taxable year (without regard to the first-year conventions under section 42(f)), such excess is not transferable to another qualified low-income building. However, if in a subsequent year there are increases in the qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3) at a reduced credit percentage, the original housing credit allocation (including the specified credit percentage and qualified basis amount) would be effective with respect to such increased credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the housing credit allocation made to a qualified low-income building exceeds the amount of credit allowable with respect to such building in any taxable year (without regard to the first-year conventions under section 42(f)), such excess is not transferable to another qualified low-income building. However, if in a subsequent year there are increases in the qualified basis for which an increased credit is allowable under section 42(f)(3) at a reduced credit percentage, the original housing credit allocation (including the specified credit percentage and qualified basis amount) would be effective with respect to such increased credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1987, a newly-constructed qualified low-income building receives a housing credit allocation of $90,000 based on a specified credit percentage of 9 percent and a specified qualified basis amount of $1,000,000. The building is placed in service in 1987, but the qualified basis in such year is only $800,000, resulting in an allowable credit in 1987 (determined without regard to the first-year conventions) of $72,000. In 1988, the qualified basis is increased to $1,100,000, resulting in an additional credit allowable under section 42(f)(3) (without regard to the first-year conventions) of $18,000 (i.e., $300,000 x .06, or \2/3\ of .09). The unused portion of the 1987 housing credit allocation ($18,000) is effective in 1988 and in each subsequent year in the compliance period only with respect to the specified qualified basis for the 1987 housing credit allocation ($1,000,000). Thus, the owner is allowed to claim a credit in 1988 and in each subsequent year (without regard to the first-year conventions), based on the effective housing credit allocation from 1987, of $84,000 (i.e., $72,000 + ($200,000 x .06)). The owner of the qualified low-income building must obtain a new housing credit allocation in 1988 with respect to the additional $100,000 of qualified basis in order to claim a credit on such basis in 1988 and in each subsequent year. If the applicable first-year convention under section 42(f)(3)(B) entitled the owner in 1988 to only \1/2\ of the otherwise applicable credit for the additions to qualified basis, under paragraph (e)(2) of this section the owner is allowed to claim a credit in 1988,

based on the effective housing credit allocation from 1987, of $78,000 (i.e., $72,000 + ($200,000 x .06 x .5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Separate housing credit allocations for new buildings and increases in qualified basis. Separate housing credit allocations must be received for each building with respect to which a housing credit may be claimed. Rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a qualified low-income building are treated as a separate new building under section 42(e) and must receive a separate housing credit allocation. Increases in qualified basis in a qualified low-income building are not generally treated as a new building for purposes of section 42. To the extent that a prior housing credit allocation received with respect to a qualified low-income building does not allow an increased credit with respect to an increase in the qualified basis of such building, an additional housing credit allocation must be received in order to claim a credit with respect to that portion of increase in qualified basis. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The amount of credit allowable with respect to an increase in qualified basis is subject to the credit percentage limitation of section 42(f)(3)(A) and the first-year convention of section 42(f)(3)(B). See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for a rule requiring that the State or local housing credit agency count a housing credit allocation made with respect to an increase in qualified basis as if the specified credit percentage were unreduced in the manner prescribed in section 42(f)(3) and the specified basis amount were unreduced by the first-year convention prescribed in section 42(f)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Acquisition of building for which a prior housing credit allocation has been made. If a carryover credit would be allowable to an acquirer of a qualified low-income building under section 42(d)(7), such acquirer need not obtain a new housing credit allocation with respect to such building. Under section 42(d)(7), the acquirer would be entitled to claim only such credits as would have been allowable to the prior owner of the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiple housing credit allocations. A qualified low-income building may receive multiple housing credit allocations from different housing credit agencies having overlapping jurisdictions. A qualified low-income building that receives a housing credit allocation set aside exclusively for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization may also receive a housing credit allocation from a housing credit agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount that is not so set aside.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exception to housing credit allocation requirement--(1) Tax-exempt bond financing--(i) In general. No housing credit allocation is required in order to claim a credit under section 42 with respect to that portion of the eligible basis (as defined in section 42(d)) of a qualified low-income building that is financed with the proceeds of an obligation described in section 103(a) (``tax-exempt bond'') which is taken into account for purposes of the volume cap under section 146. In addition, no housing credit allocation is required in order to claim a credit under section 42 with respect to the entire qualified basis (as defined in section 42(c)) of a qualified low-income building if 70 percent or more of the aggregate basis of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds which are taken into account for purposes of the volume cap under section 146. For purposes of this paragraph, ``land on which the building is located'' includes only land that is functionally related and subordinate to the qualified low-income building. See Sec.  1.103-8(b)(4)(iii) for the meaning of the term ``functionally related and subordinate''. For purposes of this paragraph, the basis of the land shall be determined using principles that are consistent with the rules contained in section 42(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax-exempt bond financing--(i) In general. No housing credit allocation is required in order to claim a credit under section 42 with respect to that portion of the eligible basis (as defined in section 42(d)) of a qualified low-income building that is financed with the proceeds of an obligation described in section 103(a) (``tax-exempt bond'') which is taken into account for purposes of the volume cap under section 146. In addition, no housing credit allocation is required in order to claim a credit under section 42 with respect to the entire qualified basis (as defined in section 42(c)) of a qualified low-income building if 70 percent or more of the aggregate basis of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds which are taken into account for purposes of the volume cap under section 146. For purposes of this paragraph, ``land on which the building is located'' includes only land that is functionally related and subordinate to the qualified low-income building. See Sec.  1.103-8(b)(4)(iii) for the meaning of the term ``functionally related and subordinate''. For purposes of this paragraph, the basis of the land shall be determined using principles that are consistent with the rules contained in section 42(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

In addition, no housing credit allocation is required in order to claim a credit under section 42 with respect to the entire qualified basis (as defined in section 42(c)) of a qualified low-income building if 70 percent or more of the aggregate basis of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds which are taken into account for purposes of the volume cap under section 146. For purposes of this paragraph, ``land on which the building is located'' includes only land that is functionally related and subordinate to the qualified low-income building. See Sec.  1.103-8(b)(4)(iii) for the meaning of the term ``functionally related and subordinate''. For purposes of this paragraph, the basis of the land shall be determined using principles that are consistent with the rules contained in section 42(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining use of bond proceeds. For purposes of determining the portion of proceeds of an issue of tax-exempt bonds used to finance (A) the eligible basis of a qualified low-income building, and (B) the aggregate basis of the building and the land on which the building is located, the proceeds of the issue must be allocated in the bond indenture or a related document (as defined in Sec.  1.103-13(b)(8)) in a manner consistent with the method used to allocate the net proceeds of the issue for purposes of determining whether 95

percent or more of the net proceeds of the issue are to be used for the exempt purpose of the issue. If the issuer is not consistent in making this allocation throughout the bond indenture and related documents, or if neither the bond indenture nor a related document provides an allocation, the proceeds of the issue will be allocated on a pro rata basis to all of the property financed by the issue, based on the relative cost of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1987, County K assigns $500,000 of its volume cap for private activity bonds under section 146 to a $500,000 issue of exempt facility bonds to provide a qualified residential rental project to be owned by A, an individual. The aggregate basis of the building and the land on which the building is located is $700,000. Under the terms of the bond indenture, the net proceeds of the issue are to be used to finance $490,000 of the eligible basis of the building. More than 70 percent of the aggregate basis of the qualified low-income building and the land on which the building is located is financed with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds to which a portion of the volume cap under section 146 was allocated. Accordingly, A may claim a credit under section 42 without regard to whether any housing credit dollar amount was allocated to that building. If, instead, the aggregate basis of the building and land were $800,000, A would be able to claim the credit under section 42 without receiving a housing credit allocation for the building only to the extent that the credit was attributable to eligible basis of the building financed with tax-exempt bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Termination of authority to make housing credit allocation--(1) In general. No State or local housing credit agency shall receive an apportionment of a State housing credit ceiling for calendar years after 1989. Consequently, no housing credit allocations may be made after 1989, except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Housing credit allocations made prior to January 1, 1990, remain effective after such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Housing credit allocations made prior to January 1, 1990, remain effective after such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryover of unused 1989 apportionment. Any State or local housing credit agency that has an unused portion of its apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling for 1989 from which housing credit allocations have not been made in 1989 may carry over such unused portion into 1990. Such carryover portion of the 1989 apportionment shall be treated as the agency's apportionment for 1990.

The transitional rules contained in section 252(f)(1) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are incorporated into this section of the regulations for purposes of determining whether a qualified low-income building is entitled to receive a housing credit allocation or is excepted from the requirement that a housing credit allocation be received. Housing credit allocations made to qualified low-income buildings described in section 252(f)(1) shall not count against the State or local housing credit agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. The transitional rules contained in section 252(f)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are incorporated into this section of the regulations for purposes of determining amounts available to certain State or local housing credit agencies for the making of housing credit allocations to certain qualified low-income housing projects. Amounts available to housing credit agencies under section 252(f)(2) shall be

treated as special apportionments unavailable for housing credit allocations to qualified low-income buildings not described in section 252(f)(2). Housing credit allocations made from the special apportionments shall not count against the State or local credit agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount. The set-aside requirements shall not apply to these special apportionments. The transitional rules contained in section 252(f)(3) of the Tax Reform Act 1986 are incorporated in this section of the regulations for purposes of determining the amount of housing credit allocations received by certain qualified low-income buildings. Housing credit allocations deemed received under section 252(f)(3) shall not count against the State or local housing credit agency's aggregate housing credit dollar amount.
