                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. An owner-occupant displaced from a mobile home or  site is entitled to a replacement housing payment, not to exceed  $22,500, under Sec. 24.401 if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person occupied the mobile home on the displacement site for  at least 180 days immediately before:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The initiation of negotiations to acquire the mobile home, if  the person owned the mobile home and the mobile home is real property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The initiation of negotiations to acquire the mobile home site  if the mobile home is personal property, but the person owns the mobile  home site; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date of the Agency's written notification to the owner- occupant that the owner is determined to be displaced from the mobile  home as described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency acquires the mobile home as real estate, or acquires  the mobile home site from the displaced owner, or the mobile home is  personal property but the owner is displaced from the mobile home  because the Agency determines that the mobile home:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is not, and cannot economically be made decent, safe, and  sanitary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cannot be relocated without substantial damage or unreasonable  cost;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Cannot be relocated because there is no available comparable  replacement site; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cannot be relocated because it does not meet mobile home park  entrance requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> incorporating the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Agency acquires the mobile home as real estate and/or  acquires the owned site, the acquisition cost used to compute the price  differential payment is the actual amount paid to the owner as just  compensation for the acquisition of the mobile home, and/or site, if  owned by the displaced mobile homeowner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency does not purchase the mobile home as real estate  but the owner is determined to be displaced from the mobile home and  eligible for a replacement housing payment based on paragraph  (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the eligible price differential payment for  the purchase of a comparable replacement mobile home, is the lesser of  the displaced mobile homeowner's net cost to purchase a replacement  mobile home (i.e., purchase price of the replacement mobile home less  trade-in or sale proceeds of the displacement mobile home); or, the cost  of the Agency's selected comparable mobile home less the Agency's  estimate of the salvage or trade-in value for the mobile home from which  the person is displaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a comparable replacement mobile home site is not available,  the price differential payment shall be computed on the basis of the  reasonable cost of a conventional comparable replacement dwelling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rental assistance payment for a 180-day owner-occupant that is  displaced from a leased or rented mobile home site. If the displacement  mobile home site is leased or rented, a displaced 180-day owner-occupant  is entitled to a rental assistance payment computed as described in  Sec. 24.402(b). This rental assistance payment may be used to lease a  replacement site; may be applied to the purchase price of a replacement  site; or may be applied, with any replacement housing payment  attributable to the mobile home, to the purchase of a replacement mobile  home or conventional decent, safe and sanitary dwelling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Owner-occupant not displaced from the mobile home. If the Agency  determines that a mobile home is personal property and may be relocated  to a comparable replacement site, but the owner-occupant elects not to  do so, the owner is not entitled to a replacement housing payment for  the purchase of a replacement mobile home. However, the owner is  eligible for moving costs described at Sec. 24.301 and any replacement  housing payment for the purchase or rental of a comparable site as   described in this section or Sec. 24.503 as applicable.</p>
