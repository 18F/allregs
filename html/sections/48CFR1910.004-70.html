However, under unusual circumstances such an approach may be used as  described below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Citing brand name products. Brand name or equal purchase  descriptions shall cite all brand name products known to be acceptable  and of current manufacture. If the use of a brand name or equal purchase  description results in the purchase of an acceptable brand name product  which was not listed as an ``equal'' product, a reference to that brand  name product should be included in the purchase description for later  acquisitions. If a brand name product is no longer applicable, the  reference thereto shall be deleted from subsequent purchase description.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specifying essential characteristics. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is imperative that  brand name or equal purchase descriptions specify each physical or  functional characteristic of the product that is essential to the  intended use. Failure to do so may result in a defective solicitation  and the necessity to resolicit the requirements. (See 1910.004-73.) Care  must be taken to avoid specifying characteristics that cannot be shown  to materially affect the intended end use and which unnecessarily  restrict competition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When describing essential characteristics, permissible  tolerances should be indicated. Avoid specifying a characteristic (e.g.,  a specific dimension) of a brand name product unless it is essential to  the Government's need. The contracting officer must be able to justify  the requirement.</p>
