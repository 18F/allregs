                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allocations when there are sufficient funds available to  compensate all uncompensated harm. If the funds available under Sec.  1075.105(c) are sufficient, the Fund Administrator will allocate to each  class of victims the amount necessary to compensate fully the  uncompensated harm, determined under Sec. 1075.104(b) as of the last  day of the most recently concluded six-month period, of all victims in  that class to whom it is practicable to make payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocations when there are insufficient funds available to  compensate all uncompensated harm. If the funds available under Sec.  1075.105(c) are not sufficient to make the allocations described in  paragraph (a) of this section, the Fund Administrator will allocate the  available funds to classes of victims as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Priority to classes of victims from the most recent six-month  period. The Fund Administrator will first allocate funds to classes of  victims from the most recently concluded six-month period, as determined  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If funds remain after allocating  to each class of victims from that six-month period the amount necessary  to compensate fully the uncompensated harm, determined under Sec.  1075.104(b) as of the last day of the most recently concluded six-month  period, of all victims in that class to whom it is practicable to make  payments, the Fund Administrator next will allocate funds to classes of  victims from the preceding six-month period, and so forth until no funds  remain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assigning classes of victims to a six-month period. For purposes  of this paragraph (b), the Fund Administrator will assign each class of  victims to the six-month period in which the victims first had  uncompensated harm as described in Sec. 1075.104(b). When a class of  victims   first had uncompensated harm as described in Sec. 1075.104(b) will be  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If redress was ordered for a class of victims in a Bureau  enforcement action but suspended or waived in whole or in part, the  class of victims first had uncompensated harm as described in Sec.  1075.104(b) on the date the suspension or waiver became effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If redress was ordered for a class of victims in a Bureau  enforcement action but determined by the Chief Financial Officer to be  uncollectible in whole or in part, the class of victims first had  uncompensated harm as described in Sec. 1075.104(b) on the date the  Chief Financial Officer made that determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If no redress was ordered for a class of victims in a Bureau  enforcement action, the class of victims first had uncompensated harm as  described in Sec. 1075.104(b) on the date the order imposing a civil  penalty became a final order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> to a class of victims if she determines that making payments  to that class of victims would be impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fund Administrator's discretion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any  provision in this part, the Fund Administrator, in her discretion, may  depart from the procedures specified by this section, including by  declining to make, or altering the amount of, any allocation provided  for by this section. Whenever the Fund Administrator exercises this  discretion, she will provide the Civil Penalty Fund Governance Board a  written explanation of the reason for departing from the procedures  specified by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the Fund Administrator exercises her discretion  under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, she may allocate funds to  consumer education and financial literacy programs under 1075.107 during  that time period only to the same extent she could have absent that  exercise of discretion.</p>
