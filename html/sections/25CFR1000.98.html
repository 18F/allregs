                                Sec. 1000.98  How does BIA determine a Tribe's/Consortium's share
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">There are typically two methods for determining the amount of funds to be included in the AFA:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formula-driven. For formula-driven programs, a Tribe's/Consortium's amount is determined by first identifying the residual funds to be retained by BIA and second, by applying the distribution formula to the remaining eligible funding for each program involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distribution formulas must be reasonably related to the function or service performed by an office, and must be consistently applied to all Tribes within each regional and agency office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The process in paragraph (a) of this section for calculating a Tribe's funding under self-governance must be consistent with the process used for calculating funds available to non-self-governance Tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tribal-specific. For programs whose funds are not distributed on a formula basis as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a Tribe's funding amount will be determined on a Tribe-by-Tribe basis and may differ between Tribes. Examples of these funds may include special project funding, awarded competitive grants, earmarked funding, and construction or other one-time or non-recurring funding for which a Tribe is eligible.</p>
