Where the Government action is directed primarily at the  contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the   other contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so  requires; thus where such Government action, although not creating any  liability on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations  of fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.</p>
