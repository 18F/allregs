The criminal justice agency created by the Governor to implement the Safe Streets Act within each State shall certify that it requires, as a condition of the receipt of block grant funds, that recipients from it have executed an Equal Employment Opportunity Program in accordance with this subpart, or that, in conformity with the terms and conditions of this regulation no equal employment opportunity programs are required to be filed by that jurisdiction.</p>
