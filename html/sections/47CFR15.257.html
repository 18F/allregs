                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operation of devices under the provisions of this section is  limited to indoor use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Devices operating under the provisions of this section, by the  nature of their design, must be capable of operation only indoors. The  necessity to operate with a fixed indoor infrastructure, e.g., a  transmitter that must be connected to the AC power lines, may be  considered sufficient to demonstrate this.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of outdoor mounted antennas, e.g., antennas mounted on  the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or any other outdoors  infrastructure is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The emissions from equipment operated under this section shall  not be intentionally directed outside of the building in which the  equipment is located, such as through a window or a doorway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Devices operating under the provisions of this section shall  bear the following or similar statement in a conspicuous location on the  device or in the instruction manual supplied with the device: ``This  equipment may only be operated indoors. Operation outdoors is in  violation of 47 U.S.C. 301 and could subject the operator to serious  legal penalties.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operation under the provisions of this section is not permitted  on aircraft or satellites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within the 92-95 GHz bands, the emission levels shall not exceed  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average power density of any emission, measured during the  transmit interval, shall not exceed 9 uW/sq. cm, as measured at 3 meters  from the radiating structure, and the peak power density of any emission  shall not exceed 18 uW/sq. cm, as measured 3 meters from the radiating  structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Peak power density shall be measured with an RF detector that  has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the band being used and has a  video bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or uses an equivalent measurement  method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The average emission limits shall be calculated based on the  measured peak levels, over the actual time period during which  transmission occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limits on spurious emissions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The power density of any emissions outside the band being used  shall consist solely of spurious emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Radiated emissions below 40 GHz shall not exceed the general  limits in Sec. 15.209.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Between 40 GHz and 200 GHz, the level of these emissions shall  not exceed 90 pW/cm \2\ at a distance of 3 meters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The levels of the spurious emissions shall not exceed the level  of the fundamental emission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The total peak transmitter output power shall not exceed 500 mW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fundamental emissions must be contained within the frequency  bands specified in this section during all conditions of operation.  Equipment is presumed to operate over the temperature range -20 to + 50  degrees Celsius with an input voltage variation of 85% to 115% of rated  input voltage, unless justification is presented to demonstrate  otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Regardless of the maximum EIRP and maximum power density levels  permitted under this section, devices operating under the provisions of  this section are subject to the radiofrequency radiation exposure  requirements specified in 47 CFR 1.1307(b), 2.1091, and 2.1093, as  appropriate. Applications for equipment authorization of devices  operating under this section must contain a statement confirming  compliance with these requirements for both fundamental emissions and  unwanted emissions. Technical information showing the basis for this  statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any transmitter that has received the necessary FCC equipment  authorization under the rules of this chapter may be mounted in a group  installation for simultaneous operation with one or more other  transmitter(s) that have received the necessary FCC equipment  authorization, without any additional equipment authorization. However,  no transmitter operating under the provisions of this section may be  equipped with external phase-locking inputs that permit beam-forming  arrays to be realized.
