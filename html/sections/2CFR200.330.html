                            <p class="depth0">The non-Federal entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor, depending on the substance of its agreements with Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. Therefore, a pass-through entity must make case-by-case determinations whether each agreement it makes for the disbursement of Federal program funds casts the party receiving the funds in the role of a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal awarding agency may supply and require recipients to comply with additional guidance to support these determinations provided such guidance does not conflict with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subrecipients. A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of a Federal award and creates a Federal assistance relationship with the subrecipient. See Sec. 200.92 Subaward. Characteristics which support the classification of the non-Federal entity as a subrecipient include when the non-Federal entity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has its performance measured in relation to whether objectives of a Federal program were met;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has responsibility for programmatic decision making;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In accordance with its agreement, uses the Federal funds to carry out a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractors. A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the non-Federal entity's own use and creates a procurement relationship with the contractor. See Sec. 200.22 Contract. Characteristics indicative of a procurement relationship between the non-Federal entity and a contractor are when the non-Federal entity receiving the Federal funds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Normally operates in a competitive environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program as a result of the agreement, though similar requirements may apply for other reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of judgment in making determination. In determining whether an agreement between a pass-through entity and another non-Federal entity casts the latter as a subrecipient or a contractor, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. All of the characteristics listed above may not be present in all cases, and the pass-through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract.</p>
