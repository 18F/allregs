The  control position shall also be equipped with suitable devices for  observing the overall characteristics of the transmissions and a carrier  operated device which will give a continuous visual indication whenever  the transmitting antenna is radiating a signal. The transmitting  apparatus shall be inspected as often as may be necessary to insure  proper operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The control circuits shall be so designed and installed that  short circuits, open circuits, other line faults, or any other cause  which would result in loss of control of the transmitter will  automatically cause the transmitter to cease radiating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application for authority to construct a new station or to  make changes in the facilities of an existing station and which proposes  operation by remote control shall include an adequate showing of the  manner of compliance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission may notify the licensee not to commence remote  control operation, or to cancel, suspend, or change the date of the  beginning of such operation as and when such action may appear to be in  the public interest, convenience, or necessity.
