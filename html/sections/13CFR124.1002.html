                                Sec. 124.1002  What is a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reliance on 8(a) criteria. In determining whether a firm qualifies as an

SDB, the criteria of social and economic disadvantage and other eligibility requirements established in subpart A of this part apply, including the requirements of ownership and control and disadvantaged status, unless otherwise provided in this subpart. Qualified Private Certifiers must use the 8(a) criteria applicable to ownership and control in determining whether a particular firm is actually owned and controlled by one or more individuals claiming disadvantaged status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> SDB eligibility criteria. A small disadvantaged business (SDB) is a concern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Which qualifies as small under part 121 of this title for the size standard corresponding to the applicable four digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of SDB certification, the applicable NAICS code is that which relates to the primary business activity of the concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes related to a specific Federal Government contract, the applicable NAICS code is that assigned by the contracting officer to the procurement at issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Which is at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as set forth in Sec. 124.105. For the requirements relating to tribes and ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, see Sec. Sec. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except for tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs, whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. For the requirements relating to tribes and ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, see Sec. Sec. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Which, for purposes of SDB procurement mechanisms authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2323 (such as price evaluation adjustments, evaluation factors or subfactors, monetary subcontracting incentives, or SDB set-asides) relating to the Department of Defense, NASA and the Coast Guard only, has the majority of its earnings accruing directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disadvantaged status. In assessing the personal financial condition of an individual claiming economic disadvantage, his or her net worth must be less than $750,000 after taking into account the exclusions set forth in Sec. 124.104(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional eligibility criteria. (1) Except for Tribes, ANCs, CDCs, and NHOs, each individual claiming disadvantaged status must be a citizen of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The other eligibility requirements set forth in Sec. 124.108 for 8(a) BD program participation do not apply to SDB eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Potential for success not required. The potential for success requirement set forth in Sec. 124.107 does not apply as an eligibility requirement for an SDB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Joint ventures. Joint ventures are permitted for SDB procurement mechanisms (such as price evaluation adjustments, evaluation factors or subfactors, monetary subcontracting incentives, or SDB set-asides), provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The disadvantaged participant(s) to the joint venture must have:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Received an SDB certification from SBA; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submitted an application for SDB certification to SBA or a Private Certifier, and must not have received a negative determination regarding that application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture means two or more concerns forming an association to engage in and carry out a single, specific business venture for joint profit. Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered ``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible to be certified as an SDB. The entity created by such a relationship would not be owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Each contract for which a joint venture submits an offer will be evaluated on a case by case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3), a concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be

affiliated with such other concern(s) for size purposes. If the exception does not apply, the combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the NAICS code designated for the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An SDB must be the managing venturer of the joint venture, and an employee of the managing venturer must be the project manager responsible for performance of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The joint venture must perform any applicable percentage of work required of SDB offerors, and the SDB joint venturer(s) must perform a significant portion of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Ownership restrictions for non-disadvantaged individuals. The ownership restrictions set forth in Sec. 124.105 (g) and (h) for non-disadvantaged individuals and concerns do not apply for purposes of determining SDB eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Full-time requirement for SDB purposes. An SDB is considered to be managed on a full-time basis by a disadvantaged individual if such individual works for the concern during all of the hours the concern operates. For example, if a concern operates 20 hours per week and the disadvantaged manager works for the firm during those twenty hours, that individual will be considered as working full time for the firm.
