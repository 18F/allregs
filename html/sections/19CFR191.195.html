Loss or Gain</p><p class="depth0">Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.</p><p class="depth0">H. Tradeoff</p><p class="depth0">The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.</p><p class="depth0">I.

On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits

A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights shall be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer shall follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights shall be filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.</p><p class="depth0">K. Inventory Procedures</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories, production and disposals from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.</p><p class="depth0">The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED.</p><p class="depth0">L. Basis of Claim for Drawback</p><p class="depth0">The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of any one type and class of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry shall not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material of the same type and class which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.</p><p class="depth0">M. Agreements</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer or producer specifically agrees that it will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;</p><p class="depth0">2. Open its refinery and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;</p><p class="depth0">3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;</p><p class="depth0">4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;</p><p class="depth0">5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and</p><p class="depth0">6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

Such products have</p><p class="depth0">``dual status'' under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). They may be designated as the</p><p class="depth0">basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">The piece goods used in manufacture will be the same kind and quality as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods of the same kind and quality as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;</p><p class="depth0">2. A tolerance of 4% in the aggregate thread count per square inch so that the piece goods used in manufacture will have an aggregate thread count within 4%, more or less of the aggregate thread count of the imported piece goods which will be designated. In each case, the average yarn number of the domestic piece goods will be the same or greater than the average yarn number of the imported piece goods designated, and in each case, the substitution and tolerance will be employed only within the same family of fabrics, i.e., print cloth for print cloth, gingham for gingham, greige for greige, dyed for dyed, bleached for bleached, etc. The piece goods used in manufacture of the exported articles will be designated as containing the identical percentage of identical fibers as the piece goods designated as the basis for allowance of drawback; for example, piece goods containing 65% cotton and 35% dacron will be designated against the use of piece goods shown to contain 65% cotton and 35% dacron. The actual fiber composition may vary slightly from that described on the invoice or other acceptance of the fabric as having the composition described on documents in accordance with trade practices. The substituted piece goods used in the manufacture of articles for exportation with drawback will be so similar in quality to the imported piece goods designated for the basis of allowance of drawback, that the piece goods used, if imported, would have been subject to the same or greater amount of duty as was paid on the imported designated piece goods.

If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the piece goods put into the finishing processes.</p><p class="depth0">G. Shrinkage, Gain, and Spoilage</p><p class="depth0">Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any.

Inventory Procedures</p><p class="depth0">The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading ``Procedures And Records Maintained''. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.</p><p class="depth0">K. Basis of Claim for Drawback</p><p class="depth0">Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of piece goods, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used to produce the exported articles less the amount of piece goods which the value of the waste would replace.</p><p class="depth0">L.

The duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used instead of the imported, duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be interchangeable for manufacturing purposes with the duty-paid steel. To be interchangeable a steel must be able to be used in place of the substituted steel without any additional processing step in the manufacture of the article on which drawback is to be claimed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by ``price extra'', and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 5, infra, insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.</p><p class="depth0">3. The duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be so similar in quality to the steel used to manufacture the articles on which drawback will be claimed that the steel so used, if imported, would be classifiable in the same tariff subheading number and at the same rate of duty as the duty-paid imported steel.</p><p class="depth0">4. Any fluctuation in market value caused by a factor other than quality does not affect drawback.</p><p class="depth0">5. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the parallel columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within a SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification) is considered to meet this criterion for ``same kind and quality.''</p><p class="depth0">B.

(The four offices where drawback claims can be filed are located at: New York, NY; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA)(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)</p><p class="depth0">GENERAL STATEMENT
(The following questions must be answered:)</p><p class="depth0">1. Who will be the importer of the designated merchandise?(If the applicant will not always be the importer of the designated merchandise, does the applicant understand its obligations to obtain the appropriate certificates of delivery (19 CFR 191.10), certificates of manufacture and delivery (19 CFR 191.24), or both?)</p><p class="depth0">2. Will an agent be used to process the designated or the substituted merchandise into articles?(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) and Sec. 191.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see Sec. 191.7 and Appendix A) or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see Sec. 191.8 and this Appendix B).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Will the applicant be the exporter?(If the applicant will not be the exporter in every case but will be the claimant, the manufacturer must state that it will reserve the right to claim drawback with the knowledge and written consent of the exporter (19 CFR 191.82).)(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Customs office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)</p><p class="depth0">PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 1313(b) (PARALLEL COLUMNS--``SAME KIND AND</p><p class="depth0">QUALITY'')IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR DRAWBACK     DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC</p><p class="depth0">PRODUCTS \1\ TO BE DESIGNATED AS     MERCHANDISE OF THE SAME KIND AND</p><p class="depth0">THE BASIS FOR DRAWBACK ON THE        QUALITY AS THAT DESIGNATED WHICH</p><p class="depth0">EXPORTED PRODUCTS                    WILL BE USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF</p><p class="depth0">THE EXPORTED PRODUCTS.1.                                   1.2.                                   2.3.                                   3.</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Drawback products are those produced in the United States in</p><p class="depth0">accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have</p><p class="depth0">``dual status'' under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the</p><p class="depth0">basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.)
(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the ``same kind and quality'' of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)</p><p class="depth0">The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the ``same kind and quality''. ``Same kind and quality'' does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (``same kind'') and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (``same quality''). In order to enable Customs to rule on ``same kind and quality'', the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)

(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the ``same kind and quality'' statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind

of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the ``same kind and quality'' determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)(The descriptions of the ``same kind and quality'' merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)</p><p class="depth0">EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)</p><p class="depth0">PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under Sec. 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in Sec. 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under Sec. 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)</p><p class="depth0">MULTIPLE PRODUCTS</p><p class="depth0">1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or \1/5\. The relative value of B is \2/15\ and of product C is \2/3\, calculated in the same manner. This means that \1/5\ of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, \2/15\ to product B, and \2/3\ to product C.)

(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state ``Not Applicable'' for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state ``Not Applicable'' for this sub-section.)</p><p class="depth0">WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a ``used in'' or ``appearing in'' basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what ``Basis'' you are using.)(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See ``Basis of Claim for Drawback'' section below.)</p><p class="depth0">STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the ``used in'' or ``used in less valuable waste'' methods are used (if the ``appearing in'' method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).

(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</p><p class="depth0">TRADEOFF
(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provision has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)</p><p class="depth0">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.

State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured ``by weight'' unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state ``Not Applicable.'')</p><p class="depth0">PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED</p><p class="depth0">We will maintain records to establish:</p><p class="depth0">1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise we designate;</p><p class="depth0">2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise \2\ we used to produce the exported articles;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ If claims are to be made on an ``appearing in'' basis, the remainder of this sentence should read ``appearing in the exported articles we produce.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at our factory, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, we produced \3\ the exported articles.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The date of production is the date an article is completed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISERECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISEBILLS OF MATERIALSMANUFACTURING RECORDSWASTE RECORDSRECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC MERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME KIND AND QUALITY WITHIN 3 YEARS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESIGNATED MERCHANDISEFINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDSSHIPPING RECORDS(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g. within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)</p><p class="depth0">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)(The ``Used In'' basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used In'' basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)

(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)(The ``Appearing In'' basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the ``Appearing in'' basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims

are made on the ``Appearing In'' basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. ``Appearing In'' may not be used if multiple products are involved.)

(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)(The ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)

(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds ``Used In'' or the 90 pounds ``Appearing In'' as set forth in the above examples.)(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)(A ``schedule'' shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)(An ``abstract'' is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)(An applicant who fails to indicate the ``schedule'' choice must base his claims on the ``abstract'' method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule follows:)</p><p class="depth0">We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)</p><p class="depth0">We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.(Neither the ``Appearing In'' basis nor the ``schedule'' method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)</p><p class="depth0">PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 1313(a)</p><p class="depth0">IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR DRAWBACK PRODUCTS USED UNDER 1313(a)

U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229.</p><p class="depth0">Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(b), and part 191 of the Customs Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.</p><p class="depth0">NAME AND ADDRESS AND IRS NUMBER (WITH SUFFIX) OF APPLICANT
(Section 191.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under Sec. 191.7 of the CBP Regulations. Customs will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (see Sec. 191.8(a)).)</p><p class="depth0">LOCATION OF FACTORY
(Give the address of the factory(ies) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. If the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, so state and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)</p><p class="depth0">PERSONS WHO WILL SIGN DRAWBACK DOCUMENTS
(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 191.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a Customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A Customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed Customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (see footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)</p><p class="depth0">CBP OFFICE WHERE DRAWBACK CLAIMS WILL BE FILED
(The four offices where drawback claims can be filed are located at: New York, NY; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA)(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)</p><p class="depth0">GENERAL STATEMENT
(The following questions must be answered:</p><p class="depth0">1. Who will be the importer of the designated merchandise?(If the applicant will not always be the importer of the designated merchandise, does the applicant understand its obligations to obtain the appropriate certificates of delivery (19 CFR 191.10), certificates of manufacture and delivery (19 CFR 191.24), or both?)</p><p class="depth0">2. Will an agent be used to process the designated or the substituted merchandise into articles?(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and Sec. 191.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see Sec. 191.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see Sec. 191.8 and this Appendix B).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Will the applicant be the exporter?(If the applicant will not be the exporter in every case but will be the claimant, the manufacturer must state that it will reserve the right to claim drawback with the knowledge and written consent of the exporter (19 CFR 191.82).)(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Drawback office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)</p><p class="depth0">(PARALLEL COLUMNS--``SAME KIND AND QUALITY'')IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR DRAWBACK     DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC</p><p class="depth0">PRODUCTS \1\ TO BE DESIGNATED AS     MERCHANDISE OF THE SAME KIND AND</p><p class="depth0">THE BASIS FOR DRAWBACK ON THE        QUALITY AS THAT DESIGNATED WHICH</p><p class="depth0">EXPORTED PRODUCTS.

Such products have</p><p class="depth0">``dual status'' under Sec.  1313(b). They may be designated as the</p><p class="depth0">basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the ``same kind and quality'' of the merchandise. This statement

should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)</p><p class="depth0">The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the ``same kind and quality''. ``Same kind and quality'' does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (``same kind'') and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (``same quality''). In order to enable Customs to rule on ``same kind and quality'', the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)

(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the ``same kind and quality'' statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the ``same kind and quality'' determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling review process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)(The descriptions of the ``same kind and quality'' merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)</p><p class="depth0">EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)</p><p class="depth0">PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under Sec. 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in Sec. 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under Sec. 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)</p><p class="depth0">MULTIPLE PRODUCTS</p><p class="depth0">1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product or by-product at

the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)

(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or \1/5\. The relative value of B is \2/15\ and of product C is \2/3\, calculated in the same manner. This means that \1/5\ of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, \2/15\ to product B, and \2/3\ to product C.)

(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state ``Not Applicable'' for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state ``Not Applicable'' for this sub-section.)</p><p class="depth0">WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a ``used in'' or ``appearing in'' basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what ``Basis'' you are using.)(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles less valuable waste, state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See ``Basis of Claim for Drawback'' section below.)</p><p class="depth0">STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the

period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the ``used in'' or ``used in less valuable waste'' methods are used (if the ``appearing in'' method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).

(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</p><p class="depth0">TRADEOFF
(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provisions has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)</p><p class="depth0">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured ``by weight'' unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state ``Not Applicable.'')</p><p class="depth0">PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED</p><p class="depth0">We will maintain records to establish:</p><p class="depth0">1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise we designate;</p><p class="depth0">2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise \2\ we used to produce the exported articles;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ If claims are to be made on an ``appearing in'' basis, the remainder of this sentence should read ``appearing in the exported articles we produce.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at our factory, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, we produced \3\ the exported articles;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The date of production is the date an article is completed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISERECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISEBILLS OF MATERIALSMANUFACTURING RECORDSWASTE RECORDSRECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTICMERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME KIND AND QUALITYWITHIN 3 YEARS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESIGNATED MERCHANDISEFINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDSSHIPPING RECORDS(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the

application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)</p><p class="depth0">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)(The ``Used In'' basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used In'' basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)

(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)(The ``Appearing In'' basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the ``Appearing In'' basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the ``Appearing In'' basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. ``Appearing In'' may not be used if multiple products are involved.)

(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)(The ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)

(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds ``Used In'' or the 90 pounds ``Appearing In'' as set forth in the above examples.)(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)(A ``schedule'' shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)

(An ``abstract'' is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)(An applicant who fails to indicate the ``schedule'' choice must base his claims on the ``abstract'' method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)</p><p class="depth0">We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)</p><p class="depth0">We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.(Neither the ``Appearing In'' basis nor the ``schedule'' method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)</p><p class="depth0">AGREEMENTS</p><p class="depth0">The Applicant specifically agrees that it will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;</p><p class="depth0">2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;</p><p class="depth0">3.

In order to obtain drawback under Sec. 1313(d), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. Describe how the tax-paid material is processed into the export article.)</p><p class="depth0">WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.) (If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a ``used in'' or ``appearing in'' basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use

in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation, does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what ``Basis'' you are using.)(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See ``Basis of Claim for Drawback'' section below.)</p><p class="depth0">STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the ``used in'' or ``used in less valuable waste'' methods are used (if the ``appearing in'' method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).

(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that the domestic tax-paid alcohol is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the domestic tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</p><p class="depth0">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured ``by weight'' unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state ``Not Applicable.'')</p><p class="depth0">PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED</p><p class="depth0">We will maintain records to establish:</p><p class="depth0">1.

Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(d) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas should be included in your discussion:)RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDSMANUFACTURING RECORDSFINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS</p><p class="depth0">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)(The ``Used In'' basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used In'' basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of flavoring extracts and medicinal or toilet preparation (including perfumery).)




(For example, if 100 gallons of alcohol, valued at $1.00 per gallon, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 100% of the tax paid on the 100 gallons of domestic alcohol used to produce the exported articles.)</p><p class="depth0">The ``Appearing In'' basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the ``Appearing In'' basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the ``Appearing In'' basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 gallons of domestic alcohol which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 gallons used in as set forth previously.)(The ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of domestic tax-paid alcohol. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the quantity of tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the exported articles, reduced by the quantity of such alcohol which the value of the waste would replace.)

(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 gallons of waste had a value of $.50 per gallon, then the 10 gallons of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 gallons of the tax-paid alcohol. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 gallons of the alcohol used, and drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on 95 gallons of alcohol rather than on the 100 gallons ``Used In'' or the 90 gallons ``Appearing In'' as set forth in the above examples.)(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)(A ``schedule'' shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)

(An ``abstract'' is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)(An applicant who fails to indicate the ``schedule'' choice must base his claims on the ``abstract'' method. State which Basis and Method you will use.

Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used In'' basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported article.)

(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of imported material used in constructing and equipping the exported articles.)(The ``Appearing In'' basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the ``Appearing In'' basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the ``Appearing In'' basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material which appears in the exported articles. ``Appearing In'' may not be used if multiple products are involved.)

(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of imported material which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)(The ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the ``Used Less Valuable Waste'' basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported product, reduced by the quantity of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)

(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the imported material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material rather than on the 100 pounds ``Used In'' or the 90 pounds ``Appearing In'' as set forth in the above examples.)(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)(A ``schedule'' shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product.
