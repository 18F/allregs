                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To qualify for preferential tariff treatment under an  applicable TPL, a good must be imported   directly from the territory of a Party into the territory of the other  Party. For purposes of this subpart, the words ``imported directly''  mean:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct shipment from the territory of a Party into the territory  of the other Party without passing through the territory of a non-Party;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the shipment passed through the territory of a non-Party, the  good, upon arrival in the territory of a Party, will be considered to be  ``imported directly'' only if the good did not undergo production,  manufacturing, or any other operation outside the territories of the  Parties, other than unloading, reloading, or any other operation  necessary to preserve the good in good condition or to transport the  good to the territory of a Party. Operations that may be performed  outside the territories of the Parties include inspection, removal of  dust that accumulates during shipment, ventilation, spreading out or  drying, chilling, replacing salt, sulfur dioxide, or aqueous solutions,  replacing damaged packing materials and containers, and removal of units  of the good that are spoiled or damaged and present a danger to the  remaining units of the good, or to transport the good to the territory  of a Party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentary evidence. An importer making a claim for  preferential tariff treatment under an applicable TPL may be required to  demonstrate, to CBP's satisfaction, that the good was ``imported  directly'' from the territory of a Party into the territory of the other  Party, as that term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section. An  importer may demonstrate compliance with this section by submitting  documentary evidence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to,  bills of lading, airway bills, packing lists, commercial invoices,  receiving and inventory records, and customs entry and exit documents.</p>
