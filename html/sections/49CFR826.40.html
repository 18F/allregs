                            <p class="depth0">Within 5 days of the Board's service of a final decision granting an  award of fees and expenses to an applicant, the Administrator shall  transmit to the applicant instructions explaining how the applicant may  obtain the award. These instructions may require, but are not limited  to, the submission of the following information to the Administrator: a  statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the  United States courts, bank routing numbers to which the Administrator  may transmit payment, and the applicant's tax identification or Social  Security number. The Administrator will pay the applicant the amount  awarded within 60 days of receiving the necessary information from the  applicant, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying  decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant  or any other party to the proceeding.
