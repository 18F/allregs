You satisfy the requirement to categorize the affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose nonpublic personal information if you list the following categories, as applicable, and a few examples to illustrate the types of third parties in each category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Financial service providers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-financial companies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disclosures under exception for service providers and joint marketers. If you disclose nonpublic personal information under the exception in Sec. 573.13 to a nonaffiliated third party to market products or services that you offer alone or jointly with another financial institution, you satisfy the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(5) of this section if you:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> List the categories of nonpublic personal information you disclose, using the same categories and examples you used to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, as applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State whether the third party is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A service provider that performs marketing services on your behalf or on behalf of you and another financial institution; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A financial institution with whom you have a joint marketing agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Simplified notices. If you do not disclose, and do not wish to reserve the right to disclose, nonpublic personal information about customers or former customers to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties except as authorized under Sec.

You provide a reasonable means by which a consumer may obtain a copy of your privacy notice if you:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide a toll-free telephone number that the consumer may call to request the notice; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a consumer who conducts business in person at your office, maintain copies of the notice on hand that you provide to the consumer immediately upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Future disclosures.
