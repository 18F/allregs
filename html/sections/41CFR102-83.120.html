                            <p class="depth0">If an agency has a need to be in a specific urban area that is not a central city in a metropolitan area, then the agency must give first consideration to locating in a historic building in a historic district in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a non-historic building in a historic district in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies should give consideration to locating in a non-historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth0">Preference to Historic Properties</p>
