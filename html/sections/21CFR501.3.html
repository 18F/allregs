This specification does not affect the  required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for  foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on  the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to  the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines  generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is  designed to be displayed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is  an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform  size and prominence, the word imitation and, immediately thereafter, the  name of the food imitated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to  the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for  and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall  not be deemed to be an imitation provided it   meets each of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it  substitutes and which it resembles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the  provisions of Sec. 502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or  misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an  appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading.
