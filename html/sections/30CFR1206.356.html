                                Sec. 1206.356  How do I calculate royalty or fees due on geothermal
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If you use the geothermal resource for direct use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For Class I leases, you must determine the royalty due on geothermal resources in accordance with the first applicable of the following three paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same direct-use facility multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease. In evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the following factors will be considered: time of execution, duration, terms, volume, quality of resource, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the resource.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable alternative energy source (fuel) multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease. The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable alternative energy source will be based on the amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct use facility in place of the geothermal resource. That amount of thermal energy (in Btu) displaced by the geothermal resource will be determined by the equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02MY07.003

Where hin is the enthalpy in Btu/lb at the direct use facility inlet (based on measured inlet temperature), hout is the enthalpy in Btu/lb at the facility outlet (based on measured outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlet temperature, the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubic feet, and volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons produced at the wellhead or measured at an approved point. The efficiency factor of the alternative energy source will be 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural gas, and other fuels derived from oil and natural gas, or an efficiency factor proposed by the lessee and approved by ONRR. The methods of measuring resource parameters (temperature, volume, etc.) and the frequency of computing and accumulating the amount of thermal energy displaced will be determined and approved by BLM under 43 CFR 3275.13-3275.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A royalty determined by any other reasonable method approved by ONRR or the Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget of the Department of the Interior, under Sec. 1206.364 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For geothermal resources produced from Class II and Class III leases, you must multiply the appropriate fee from the schedule in subparagraph (b)(1) of this section by the number of gallons or pounds you produce from the direct use lease each month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must use the following fee schedule to calculate fees due under this section:</p><p class="depth0">Direct Use Fee Schedule</p><p class="depth0">[Hot water]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">If your average monthly inlet temperature ([deg]F) is                     Your fees are . . .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">But less than    ($/million      ($/million</p><p class="depth0">At least . . .                                . . .         gallons)         pounds)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------130.............................................................             140           2.524           0.307140.............................................................             150           7.549           0.921150.............................................................             160          12.543           1.536160.............................................................             170          17.503           2.150170.............................................................             180          22.426           2.764180.............................................................             190          27.310           3.379190.............................................................             200          32.153           3.993200.............................................................             210          36.955           4.607210.............................................................             220          41.710           5.221220.............................................................             230          46.417           5.836230.............................................................             240          51.075           6.450240.............................................................             250          55.682           7.064250.............................................................             260          60.236           7.679260.............................................................             270          64.736           8.293270.............................................................             280          69.176           8.907280.............................................................             290          73.558           9.521290.............................................................             300          77.876          10.136300.............................................................             310          82.133          10.750310.............................................................             320          86.328          11.364320.............................................................             330          90.445          11.979330.............................................................             340          94.501          12.593340.............................................................             350          98.481          13.207</p><p class="depth0">350.............................................................             360         102.387          13.821----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For direct use geothermal resources with an average monthly inlet temperature of 130 [deg]F or less, you must pay only the lease rental.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ONRR, in consultation with BLM, will develop and publish a revised fee schedule in the Federal Register, as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ONRR, in consultation with BLM, will calculate revised fees schedules using the following formulas:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02MY07.004
