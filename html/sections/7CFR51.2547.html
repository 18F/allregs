Such defects include, but are not limited to evidence of insects, immature kernels, rancid kernels, mold, or decay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Damage by internal (kernel) defects means any specific defect described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual kernel or of the lot.

Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Decay means one-sixteenth or more of the kernel surface is decomposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other defects means defects which cannot be considered internal defects or external defects.
