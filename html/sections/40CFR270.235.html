(A) Under this option, the Director will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify a subset of relevant existing permit requirements, or develop alternative permit requirements, that ensure emissions of toxic compounds are minimized from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents, based on review of information including the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, design, and operating history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retain or add these permit requirements to the permit to apply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Changes that may significantly increase emissions. (1) You must notify the Director in writing of changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan or changes to the design of the source that may significantly increase emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents. You must notify the Director of such changes within five days of making such changes. You must identify in the notification recommended revisions to permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director may revise permit conditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon permit renewal, or, if warranted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By modifying the permit under Sec. Sec.  270.41(a) or 270.42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Remove permit conditions. Under this option:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator must document that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under Sec.  63.1206(c)(2) of this chapter has been approved by the Administrator under Sec.  63.1206(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Director will remove permit conditions that are no longer applicable according to Sec. Sec.  264.340(b) and 266.100(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Addressing permit conditions upon permit reissuance. The owner or operator of an incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace that

has conducted a comprehensive performance test and submitted to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance with the standards of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter may request in the application to reissue the permit for the combustion unit that the Director control emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under any of the following options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> RCRA option A. (A) Under this option, the Director will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Include, in the permit, conditions that ensure compliance with Sec. Sec.  264.345(a) and 264.345(c) or Sec. Sec.  266.102(e)(1) and 266.102(e)(2)(iii) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specify that these permit requirements apply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> RCRA option B. (A) Under this option, the Director will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Include, in the permit conditions, that ensure emissions of toxic compounds are minimized from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents, based on review of information including the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, design, and operating history; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specify that these permit requirements apply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Changes that may significantly increase emissions. (1) You must notify the Director in writing of changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan or changes to the design of the source that may significantly increase emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents. You must notify the Director of such changes within five days of making such changes. You must identify in the notification recommended revisions to permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director may revise permit conditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon permit renewal, or, if warranted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By modifying the permit under Sec.
