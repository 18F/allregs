These operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems on the coating operation(s) for which you use this option, and you must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the requirements in Sec. 63.4167. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 1 to this subpart or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under Sec. 63.8(f).</p>
