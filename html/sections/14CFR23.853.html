                            <p class="depth0">For each compartment to be used by the crew or passengers:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The materials must be at least flame-resistant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If smoking is to be prohibited, there must be a placard so  stating, and if smoking is to be allowed--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There must be an adequate number of self-contained, removable  ashtrays; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the crew compartment is separated from the passenger  compartment, there must be at least one illuminated sign (using either  letters or symbols) notifying all passengers when smoking is prohibited.  Signs which notify when smoking is prohibited must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When illuminated, be legible to each passenger seated in the  passenger cabin under all probable lighting conditions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be so constructed that the crew can turn the illumination on  and off; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, for commuter category airplanes the following  requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each disposal receptacle for towels, paper, or waste must be  fully enclosed and constructed of at least fire resistant materials and  must contain fires likely to occur in it under normal use. The ability  of the disposal receptacle to contain those fires under all probable  conditions of wear, misalignment, and ventilation expected in service  must be demonstrated by test. A placard containing the legible words  ``No Cigarette Disposal'' must be located on or near each disposal  receptacle door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lavatories must have ``No Smoking'' or ``No Smoking in  Lavatory'' placards located conspicuously on each side of the entry  door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Materials (including finishes or decorative surfaces applied to  the materials) used in each compartment occupied by the crew or  passengers must meet the following test criteria as applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interior ceiling panels, interior wall panels, partitions,  galley structure, large cabinet walls, structural flooring, and  materials used in the construction of stowage compartments (other than  underseat stowage compartments and compartments for stowing small items  such as magazines and maps) must be self-extinguishing when tested  vertically in accordance with the applicable portions of appendix F of  this part or by other equivalent methods. The average burn length may  not exceed 6 inches and the average flame time after removal of the  flame source may not exceed 15 seconds. Drippings from the test specimen  may not continue to flame for more than an average of 3 seconds after  falling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Floor covering, textiles (including draperies and upholstery),  seat cushions, padding, decorative and nondecorative coated fabrics,  leather, trays and galley furnishings, electrical conduit, thermal and  acoustical insulation and insulation covering, air ducting, joint and  edge covering, cargo compartment liners, insulation blankets, cargo  covers and transparencies, molded and thermoformed parts, air ducting  joints, and trim strips (decorative and chafing), that are constructed  of materials not covered in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section must be  self extinguishing when tested vertically in accordance with the  applicable portions of appendix F of this part or other approved  equivalent methods. The average burn length may not exceed 8 inches and  the average flame time after removal of the flame source may not exceed  15 seconds. Drippings from the test specimen may not continue to flame  for more than an average of 5 seconds after falling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Motion picture film must be safety film meeting the Standard  Specifications for Safety Photographic Film PH1.25 (available from the  American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y.  10018) or an FAA approved equivalent. If the film travels through ducts,  the ducts must meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Acrylic windows and signs, parts constructed in whole or in  part of elastomeric materials, edge-lighted instrument assemblies  consisting of two or more instruments in a common housing, seatbelts,  shoulder harnesses, and cargo and baggage tiedown equipment, including  containers, bins, pallets, etc., used in passenger or crew compartments,  may not have an average burn rate greater than 2.5 inches per minute  when tested horizontally in accordance with the applicable portions of  appendix F of this part or by other approved equivalent methods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Except for electrical wire cable insulation, and for small parts  (such as knobs, handles, rollers, fasteners, clips, grommets, rub  strips, pulleys, and small electrical parts) that the Administrator  finds would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire,  materials in items not specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), (iii),  or (iv) of this section may not have a burn rate greater than 4.0 inches  per minute when tested horizontally in accordance with the applicable  portions of appendix F of this part or by other approved equivalent  methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lines, tanks, or equipment containing fuel, oil, or other  flammable fluids may not be installed in such   compartments unless adequately shielded, isolated, or otherwise  protected so that any breakage or failure of such an item would not  create a hazard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Airplane materials located on the cabin side of the firewall  must be self-extinguishing or be located at such a distance from the  firewall, or otherwise protected, so that ignition will not occur if the  firewall is subjected to a flame temperature of not less than 2,000  degrees F for 15 minutes. For self-extinguishing materials (except  electrical wire and cable insulation and small parts that the  Administrator finds would not contribute significantly to the  propagation of a fire), a vertifical self-extinguishing test must be  conducted in accordance with appendix F of this part or an equivalent  method approved by the Administrator. The average burn length of the  material may not exceed 6 inches and the average flame time after  removal of the flame source may not exceed 15 seconds. Drippings from  the material test specimen may not continue to flame for more than an  average of 3 seconds after falling.
