To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, and it must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to provide essential municipal services.

The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential services provided prior to the disaster;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrated need for financial assistance. The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions. The criteria used

in making this determination may include some or all of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Danger of municipal insolvency.
