In no case can the timeframes proposed in the Quality Improvement Plan exceed one year from the date that the grantee received official notification of the deficiencies to be corrected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 30 days of the receipt of the Quality Improvement Plan, the responsible HHS official will notify the Early Head Start or Head Start grantee, in writing, of the Plan's approval or specify the reasons why the Plan is disapproved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Quality Improvement Plan is disapproved, the Early Head Start or Head Start grantee must submit a revised Quality Improvement Plan, making the changes necessary to address the reasons that the initial Plan was disapproved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an Early Head Start or Head Start grantee fails to correct a deficiency, either immediately, or within the timeframe specified in the approved Quality Improvement Plan, the responsible HHS official will issue a letter of termination or denial of refunding. Head Start grantees may appeal terminations and denials of refunding under 45 CFR part 1303, while Early Head Start grantees may appeal terminations and denials of refunding only under 45 CFR part 74 or part 92.
