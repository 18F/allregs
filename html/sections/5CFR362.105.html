                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Workforce Planning. Before filling any positions under these Programs, agencies should include measures in their workforce planning to ensure that an adequate number of permanent positions will be available to convert Pathways Participants who successfully complete their Programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Announcements. When an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce, it must provide OPM information concerning Pathways Programs job opportunities as provided in each Pathways Program. For the purposes of this paragraph, ``agency'' means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 and the Government Printing Office. An Executive department may treat each of its bureaus or components (first major subdivision that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from other bureaus or components in work function and operation) as a separate agency or as part of one agency, but must do so consistent with its Delegated Examining Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Appointments. (1) Agencies must fill positions under the Pathways Programs using the excepted service appointing authority provided by Sec. 213.3402 (a), (b), or (c) of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agencies must follow the procedures of part 302 of this chapter when filling a position under a Pathways Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appointments are subject to all the requirements and conditions governing term, career, or career-conditional employment, including investigation to establish an appointee's qualifications and suitability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility. Except as set forth in this section, eligibility requirements for appointment under a Pathways Program are specified in each Pathways Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Citizenship. (1) An agency may appoint a non-citizen provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Pathways Participant is lawfully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident or is otherwise authorized to be employed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The agency is authorized to pay aliens under the annual Appropriations Act ban and any agency-specific enabling and appropriation statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Pathways Participant must be a United States citizen to be eligible for noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Employment of relatives. In accordance with part 310 of this chapter, a Pathways Participant may work in the same agency with a relative when there is no direct reporting relationship and the relative is not in a position to influence or control the Participant's appointment, employment, promotion or advancement within the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Length of Appointments. Except as provided in subpart B, Recent Graduate and PMF appointments under this authority may not exceed 2 years plus any agency-approved extension of up to 120 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Terminations. An agency may terminate a Pathways Participant for reasons including misconduct, poor performance, or suitability under the provisions of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Performance and progress evaluation. Each Participant must be placed on a performance plan, as prescribed by part 430 of this chapter or other applicable law or regulation, establishing performance elements and standards that are directly related to acquiring and demonstrating the various leadership, technical, and/or general competencies expected of the Participant, as well as the elements and standards established for the duties assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Compensation. The rules for setting pay upon the initial appointment of a Participant are governed by the pay administration rules of the pay system or pay plan of the Participant's position under the Pathways program. In determining the Participant's compensation, agencies may also use any applicable pay flexibilities available under that pay system or pay plan (e.g., recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives under part 575 of this chapter; student loan repayments under part 537; and, for General Schedule positions, special rates under part 530, subpart C, and the superior qualifications and special needs pay setting authority and the maximum payable rate rule under part 531, subpart B).</p>
