If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the non-Federal entity must retain the supplies for use on other activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation must be computed in the same manner as for equipment. See Sec. 75.320(e)(2) for the calculation methodology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies, the non-Federal entity must not use supplies acquired under a Federal

award to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute.</p>
