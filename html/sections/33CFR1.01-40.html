                            <p class="depth0">The Commandant delegates to the Vice Commandant authority to take final agency action under 46 CFR part 5, Subparts I, J and K on each petition to reopen a hearing and on each appeal from a decision of an Administrative Law Judge, except on petition or appeal in a case in which an order of revocation has been issued. This delegation does not prevent the Vice Commandant from acting as Commandant, as prescribed in 14 U.S.C. 47(a), for all purposes of 46 CFR part 5.
