This  requirement does not apply when a default percent moisture value, as  provided in Sec. Sec. 75.11(b) or 75.12(b), is used to account for the  hourly moisture content of the stack gas; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A valid, quality-assured hour of heat input rate data (in mmBtu/ hr) has not been measured and recorded for a unit from a certified flow  monitor and a certified diluent (CO2 or O2)  monitor or by an approved alternative monitoring system under subpart E  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, the owner or operator shall have no need to provide  substitute data according to the missing data procedures in this subpart  if the owner or operator uses SO2, CO2,  NOX, or O2 concentration, flow rate, percent  moisture, or NOX emission rate data recorded from either a  certified redundant or regular non-redundant backup CEMS, a like-kind  replacement non-redundant backup analyzer, or a backup reference method  monitoring system when the certified primary monitor is not operating or  is out-of-control. A redundant or non-redundant backup continuous  emission monitoring system must have been certified according to the  procedures in Sec. 75.20 prior to the missing data period. Non-redundant   backup continuous emission monitoring system must pass a linearity check  (for pollutant concentration monitors) or a calibration error test (for  flow monitors) prior to each period of use of the certified backup  monitor for recording and reporting emissions. Use of a certified backup  monitoring system or backup reference method monitoring system is  optional and at the discretion of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the certified primary monitor is not operating or out-of- control, then data recorded for an affected unit from a certified backup  continuous emission monitor or backup reference method monitoring system  are used, as if such data were from the certified primary monitor, to  calculate monitor data availability in Sec. 75.32, and to provide the  quality-assured data used in the missing data procedures in  Sec. Sec. 75.31 and 75.33, such as the ``hour after'' value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable  provisions of this paragraph during hours in which a unit with an  SO2 continuous emission monitoring system combusts only  gaseous fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the owner or operator shall, for purposes  of reporting heat input data under Sec. 75.57(b)(5), and for the  calculation of SO2 mass emissions using Equation F-23 in  section 7 of appendix F to this part, substitute for missing data from a  flow monitoring system, CO2 diluent monitor or O2  diluent monitor using the missing data substitution procedures in  Sec. 75.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the owner or  operator shall substitute for missing total sulfur content, gross  calorific value, and fuel flowmeter data using the missing data  procedures in appendix D to this part and shall also, for purposes of  reporting heat input data under Sec. 75.54(b)(5) or Sec. 75.57(b)(5), as  applicable, substitute for missing data from a flow monitoring system,  CO2 diluent monitor, or O2 diluent monitor using  the missing data substitution procedures in Sec. 75.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of a unit with an SO2  monitoring system shall not include hours when the unit combusts only  gaseous fuel in the SO2 data availability calculations in  Sec. 75.32 or in the calculations of substitute SO2 data  using the procedures of either Sec. 75.31 or Sec. 75.33, for hours when  SO2 emissions are determined in accordance with  Sec. 75.11(e)(1) or (e)(2). For the purpose of the missing data and  availability procedures for SO2 pollutant concentration  monitors in Sec. Sec. 75.31 and 75.33 only, all hours during which the  unit combusts only gaseous fuel shall be excluded from the definition of  ``monitor operating hour,'' ``quality-assured monitor operating hour,''  ``unit operating hour,'' and ``unit operating day,'' when SO2  emissions are determined in accordance with Sec. 75.11(e)(1) or (e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During all hours in which a unit with an SO2  continuous emission monitoring system combusts only gaseous fuel and the  owner or operator uses the SO2 monitoring system to determine  SO2 mass emissions pursuant to Sec. 75.11(e)(3), the owner or  operator shall determine the percent monitor data availability for  SO2 in accordance with Sec. 75.32 and shall use the standard  SO2 missing data procedures of Sec. 75.33.
