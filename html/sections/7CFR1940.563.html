The criteria used in the basic  formula are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural occupied  substandard units,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State's percentage of the National rural population in places of  less than 2,500 population,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State's percentage of the national number of rural households  between 80 and 100 percent of the area median income, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State's percentage of the national number of rural renter  households paying more than 35 percent of income for rent.    Data source for each of these criteria is based on the latest census  data available. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according  to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each  criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a  basic State factor (SF) as follows:  SF = (criterion 1 x weight of 30%) + (criterion 2 x weight of 10%) +  (criterion 3 x weight of 30%) + (criterion 4 x weight of 30%)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this subpart. The  percentage range used for Section 502 guaranteed RH loans is plus or  minus 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of this subpart.

Jurisdictions receiving formula allocations do not receive  administrative allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mid-year: If used in a particular fiscal year, available funds  unobligated as of the pooling date are pooled and redistributed based on  the formula used to allocate funds initially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Year-end: Pooled funds are placed in a National Office reserve  and are available as determined administratively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> of  this subpart.
