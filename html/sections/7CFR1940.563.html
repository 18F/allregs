The data source for each criterion is specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a basic State factor (SF) as follows:</p><p class="depth3">SF = (criterion 1 x weight of 30%) + (criterion 2 x weight of 10%) + (criterion 3 x weight of 30%) + (criterion 4 x weight of 30%)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The data source for the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is the most recent decennial Census.
