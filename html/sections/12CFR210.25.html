                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority and purpose. This subpart provides rules to govern funds transfers through Fedwire, and has been issued pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act--section 13 (12 U.S.C. 342), paragraph (f) of section 19 (12 U.S.C. 464), paragraph 14 of section 16 (12 U.S.C. 248(o)), and paragraphs (i) and (j) of section 11 (12 U.S.C. 248(i) and (j))--and other laws and has the force and effect of federal law. This subpart is not a funds-transfer system rule as defined in Section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope. (1) This subpart incorporates the provisions of article 4A set forth in appendix B to this subpart. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of the sections of this subpart and appendix B to this subpart, the provisions of the sections of this subpart shall prevail. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions this subpart and section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act shall prevail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, this Subpart governs the rights and obligations of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Federal Reserve Banks sending or receiving payment orders;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Senders that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Receiving banks that receive payment orders directly from a Federal Reserve Bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders sent to a Federal Reserve Bank by means of credit to an account maintained or used at a Federal Reserve Bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out through Fedwire to the same extent as if this subpart were considered a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This subpart governs a funds transfer that is sent through Fedwire, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, even though a portion of the funds transfer is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, but the portion of such funds transfer that is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (other than section 919 governing remittance transfers) is not governed by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the event that any portion of this Subpart establishes rights or obligations with respect to the availability of funds that are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act or the Board's Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks, those provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC shall apply and the portion of this Subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein, shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Operating Circulars. Each Federal Reserve Bank shall issue an Operating Circular consistent with this Subpart that governs the details of its funds-transfer operations and other matters it deems appropriate. Among other things, the Operating Circular may: set cut-off hours and funds-transfer business days; address available security procedures; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; identify messages that are not payment orders; and impose charges for funds-transfer services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the United States, the parties specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of the United States, or a wholly-owned or controlled Government corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An international organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A foreign central bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of a foreign government, or a wholly-owned or controlled corporation of a foreign government.
