                            <p class="depth0">A person who obtains a facility that is under contract under this  part may request permission to succeed to the program agreement and CCC  may grant such request if it is determined that permitting such  succession would serve the purposes of the program. If appropriate, CCC  may require the consent of the original party to such succession. Also,  CCC may terminate a contract and demand full refund of payments made if  a contracting party loses control of a facility whose increased  production is the basis of a program payment or otherwise fails to  retain the ability to assure that all program obligations and  requirements will be met.</p>
