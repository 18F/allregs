                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of implementing the Act and this Part, the following  terms are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency means any executive department, military department,  Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other  establishment in the executive branch of the government, or any  independent regulatory agency, but does not include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The General Accounting Office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal Election Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The governments of the District of Columbia and the territories  and possessions of the United States, and their various subdivisions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Government-owned contractor-operated facilities, including  laboratories engaged in national defense research and production  activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources  expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or  provide information to or for a Federal agency, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reviewing instructions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and  systems for the purpose of collecting, validating, and verifying  information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology  and systems for the purpose of processing and maintaining information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and  systems for the purpose of disclosing and providing information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Adjusting the existing ways to comply with any previously  applicable instructions and requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Training personnel to be able to respond to a collection of  information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Searching data sources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Completing and reviewing the collection of information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Transmitting, or otherwise disclosing the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply  with a collection of information that would be incurred by persons in  the normal course of their activities (e.g., in compiling and  maintaining business records) will be excluded from the ``burden'' if  the agency demonstrates that the reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure  activities needed to comply are usual and customary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A collection of information conducted or sponsored by a Federal  agency that is also conducted or sponsored by a unit of State, local, or  tribal government is presumed to impose a Federal burden except to the  extent that the agency shows that such State, local, or tribal  requirement would be imposed even in the absence of a Federal  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection of information means, except as provided in  Sec. 1320.4, the obtaining, causing to be obtained, soliciting, or  requiring the disclosure to an agency, third parties or the public of  information by or for an agency by means of identical questions posed  to, or identical reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requirements  imposed on, ten or more persons, whether such collection of information  is mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain or retain a benefit.  ``Collection of information''   includes any requirement or request for persons to obtain, maintain,  retain, report, or publicly disclose information. As used in this Part,  ``collection of information'' refers to the act of collecting or  disclosing information, to the information to be collected or disclosed,  to a plan and/or an instrument calling for the collection or disclosure  of information, or any of these, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A ``collection of information'' may be in any form or format,  including the use of report forms; application forms; schedules;  questionnaires; surveys; reporting or recordkeeping requirements;  contracts; agreements; policy statements; plans; rules or regulations;  planning requirements; circulars; directives; instructions; bulletins;  requests for proposal or other procurement requirements; interview  guides; oral communications; posting, notification, labeling, or similar  disclosure requirements; telegraphic or telephonic requests; automated,  electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques;  standard questionnaires used to monitor compliance with agency  requirements; or any other techniques or technological methods used to  monitor compliance with agency requirements. A ``collection of  information'' may implicitly or explicitly include related collection of  information requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements by an agency for a person to obtain or compile  information for the purpose of disclosure to members of the public or  the public at large, through posting, notification, labeling or similar  disclosure requirements constitute the ``collection of information''  whenever the same requirement to obtain or compile information would be  a ``collection of information'' if the information were directly  provided to the agency. The public disclosure of information originally  supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of  disclosure to the public is not included within this definition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Collection of information'' includes questions posed to  agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States, if the  results are to be used for general statistical purposes, that is, if the  results are to be used for statistical compilations of general public  interest, including compilations showing the status or implementation of  Federal activities and programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As used in paragraph (c) of this section, ``ten or more  persons'' refers to the persons to whom a collection of information is  addressed by the agency within any 12-month period, and to any  independent entities to which the initial addressee may reasonably be  expected to transmit the collection of information during that period,  including independent State, territorial, tribal or local entities and  separately incorporated subsidiaries or affiliates. For the purposes of  this definition of ``ten or more persons,'' ``persons'' does not include  employees of the respondent acting within the scope of their employment,  contractors engaged by a respondent for the purpose of complying with  the collection of information, or current employees of the Federal  government (including military reservists and members of the National  Guard while on active duty) when acting within the scope of their  employment, but it does include retired and other former Federal  employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any recordkeeping, reporting, or disclosure requirement  contained in a rule of general applicability is deemed to involve ten or  more persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any collection of information addressed to all or a substantial  majority of an industry is presumed to involve ten or more persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conduct or Sponsor. A Federal agency is considered to ``conduct  or sponsor'' a collection of information if the agency collects the  information, causes another agency to collect the information, contracts  or enters into a cooperative agreement with a person to collect the  information, or requires a person to provide information to another  person, or in similar ways causes another agency, contractor, partner in  a cooperative agreement, or person to obtain, solicit, or require the  disclosure to third parties or the public of information by or for an  agency. A collection of information undertaken by a recipient of a  Federal grant is considered to be ``conducted or sponsored'' by an  agency only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient of a grant is conducting the collection of  information at the specific request of the agency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms and conditions of the grant require specific approval  by the agency of the collection of information or collection procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Director means the Director of OMB, or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Display means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other  written collections of information sent or made available to potential  respondents (other than in an electronic format), to place the currently  valid OMB control number on the front page of the collection of  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other  written collections of information sent or made available to potential  respondents in an electronic format, to place the currently valid OMB  control number in the instructions, near the title of the electronic  collection instrument, or, for on-line applications, on the first screen  viewed by the respondent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of collections of information published in  regulations, guidelines, and other issuances in the Federal Register, to  publish the currently valid OMB control number in the Federal Register  (for example, in the case of a collection of information in a  regulation, by publishing the OMB control number in the preamble or the  regulatory text for the final rule, in a technical amendment to the  final rule, or in a separate notice announcing OMB approval of the  collection of information). In the case of a collection of information  published in an issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal  Regulations, publication of the currently valid control number in the  Code of Federal Regulations constitutes an alternative means of  ``display.'' In the case of a collection of information published in an  issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal Regulations, OMB  recommends for ease of future reference that, even where an agency has  already ``displayed'' the OMB control number by publishing it in the  Federal Register as a separate notice or in the preamble for the final  rule (rather than in the regulatory text for the final rule or in a  technical amendment to the final rule), the agency also place the  currently valid control number in a table or codified section to be  included in the Code of Federal Regulations. For placement of OMB  control numbers in the Code of Federal Regulations, see 1 CFR 21.35.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In other cases, and where OMB determines in advance in writing  that special circumstances exist, to use other means to inform potential  respondents of the OMB control number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Independent regulatory agency means the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Communications  Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the  Federal Maritime Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the  Interstate Commerce Commission, the Mine Enforcement Safety and Health  Review Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Review  Commission, the Postal Rate Commission, the Securities and Exchange  Commission, and any other similar agency designated by statute as a  Federal independent regulatory agency or commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Information means any statement or estimate of fact or opinion,  regardless of form or format, whether in numerical, graphic, or  narrative form, and whether oral or maintained on paper, electronic or  other media. ``Information'' does not generally include items in the  following categories; however, OMB may determine that any specific item  constitutes ``information'':</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Affidavits, oaths, affirmations, certifications, receipts,  changes of address, consents, or acknowledgments; provided that they  entail no burden other than that necessary to identify the respondent,  the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument (by  contrast, a certification would likely involve the collection of  ``information'' if an agency conducted or sponsored it as a substitute  for a   collection of information to collect evidence of, or to monitor,  compliance with regulatory standards, because such a certification would  generally entail burden in addition to that necessary to identify the  respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the  instrument);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Samples of products or of any other physical objects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facts or opinions obtained through direct observation by an  employee or agent of the sponsoring agency or through nonstandardized  oral communication in connection with such direct observations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations  of comments from the public, published in the Federal Register or other  publications, regardless of the form or format thereof, provided that no  person is required to supply specific information pertaining to the  commenter, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a  condition of the agency's full consideration of the comment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Facts or opinions obtained initially or in follow-on requests,  from individuals (including individuals in control groups) under  treatment or clinical examination in connection with research on or  prophylaxis to prevent a clinical disorder, direct treatment of that  disorder, or the interpretation of biological analyses of body fluids,  tissues, or other specimens, or the identification or classification of  such specimens;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A request for facts or opinions addressed to a single person;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Examinations designed to test the aptitude, abilities, or  knowledge of the persons tested and the collection of information for  identification or classification in connection with such examinations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with  public hearings or meetings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Facts or opinions obtained or solicited through nonstandardized  follow-up questions designed to clarify responses to approved  collections of information; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Like items so designated by OMB.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> OMB refers to the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Penalty includes the imposition by an agency or court of a fine  or other punishment; a judgment for monetary damages or equitable  relief; or the revocation, suspension, reduction, or denial of a  license, privilege, right, grant, or benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Person means an individual, partnership, association,  corporation (including operations of government-owned contractor- operated facilities), business trust, or legal representative, an  organized group of individuals, a State, territorial, tribal, or local  government or branch thereof, or a political subdivision of a State,  territory, tribal, or local government or a branch of a political  subdivision;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Practical utility means the actual, not merely the theoretical  or potential, usefulness of information to or for an agency, taking into  account its accuracy, validity, adequacy, and reliability, and the  agency's ability to process the information it collects (or a person's  ability to receive and process that which is disclosed, in the case of a  third-party or public disclosure) in a useful and timely fashion. In  determining whether information will have ``practical utility,'' OMB  will take into account whether the agency demonstrates actual timely use  for the information either to carry out its functions or make it  available to third-parties or the public, either directly or by means of  a third-party or public posting, notification, labeling, or similar  disclosure requirement, for the use of persons who have an interest in  entities or transactions over which the agency has jurisdiction. In the  case of recordkeeping requirements or general purpose statistics (see  Sec. 1320.3(c)(3)), ``practical utility'' means that actual uses can be  demonstrated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Recordkeeping requirement means a requirement imposed by or for  an agency on persons to maintain specified records, including a  requirement to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retain such records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify third parties, the Federal government, or the public of  the existence of such records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclose such records to third parties, the Federal government,  or the public; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Report to third parties, the Federal government, or the public  regarding such records.</p>
