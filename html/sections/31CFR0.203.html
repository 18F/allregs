and retaining a gift from a foreign government that is of minimal value and offered as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, unless otherwise prohibited by bureau regulation (5 U.S.C. 7342). Minimal value is prescribed in 41 CFR part 101-49 and was set at $225.00 on the date that the Rules became effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All gifts exceeding minimal value, the refusal of which would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States, shall be accepted and deposited with the Department within sixty days of acceptance. If the gift is travel or expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States, it shall be reported within thirty days (see 5 U.S.C. 7342(c)(1)(B)(ii)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As used in paragraph (b) of this section, Deposit with the Department means delivery to the Department Gift Unit or other depository as authorized by the Treasury Directive on Foreign Gifts (Treasury Directive 61-04).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All foreign gifts must be reported as prescribed in the Treasury Directive on Foreign Gifts (Treasury Directive 61-04).</p>
