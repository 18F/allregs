                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lump-sum commutation of future benefits. If a lump-sum  compensation award stipulates that the amount paid is intended to  compensate the individual for all future medical expenses required  because of the work-related injury or disease, Medicare payments for  such services are excluded until medical expenses related to the injury  or disease equal the amount of the lump-sum payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lump-sum compromise settlement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A lump-sum compromise  settlement is deemed to be a workers' compensation payment for Medicare  purposes, even if the settlement agreement stipulates that there is no  liability under the workers' compensation law or plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a settlement appears to represent an attempt to shift to  Medicare the responsibility for payment of medical expenses for the  treatment of a work-related condition, the settlement will not be  recognized. For example, if the parties to a settlement attempt to  maximize the amount of disability benefits paid under workers'  compensation by releasing the workers' compensation carrier from  liability for medical expenses for a particular condition even though  the facts show that the condition is work-related, Medicare will not pay  for treatment of that condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lump-sum compromise settlement: Effect on services furnished  before the date of settlement. Medicare pays for medical expenses  incurred before the lump-sum compromise settlement only to the extent  specified in Sec. 411.47.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lump-sum compromise settlement: Effect on payment for services  furnished after the date of settlement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic rule. Except as  specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if a lump-sum compromise  settlement forecloses the possibility of future payment of workers'  compensation benefits, medical expenses incurred after the date of the  settlement are payable under Medicare.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. If the settlement agreement allocates certain amounts  for specific future medical services, Medicare does not pay for those  services until medical expenses related to the injury or disease equal  the amount of the lump-sum settlement allocated to future medical  expenses.</p>
