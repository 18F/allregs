                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification to CMS. An HMO's or CMP's request to make a  withdrawal from its benefit stabilization fund for use during a contract  period must be made when the HMO or CMP notifies CMS of its ACR and its  ACPRP for that contract period. In making its request, the HMO or CMP  must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indicate how it intends to use the withdrawn amounts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Justify the need for the withdrawal in terms of stabilizing the  additional benefits it provides to Medicare enrollees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Document the HMO's or CMP's experience with fluctuations of  revenue requirements relative to the additional benefits it provides to  Medicare enrollees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Document its experience during the contract period previous to  the one for which it requests withdrawal to ensure that the HMO or CMP  will not be using the withdrawn amounts to refinance losses suffered  during that previous contract period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for CMS approval. CMS approves a request for a  withdrawal from a benefit stabilization fund for use during the next  contract period only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HMO's or CMP's average of its per capita rates of payment  for the next contract period is less than that of the previous contract  period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The HMO's or CMP's ACR for the next contract period is  significantly higher than that of the previous contract period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The HMO's or CMP's revenue requirements for the next contract  period for providing the additional benefits it provided during the  previous contract period is significantly higher than the requirements  for that previous period and the ACR for the next contract period  results in an additional benefits package that is less in total value  than that of the previous contract period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis for denial. CMS does not approve a request for a  withdrawal from a benefit stabilization fund if the withdrawal would  allow the HMO or CMP to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Offer without charge the supplemental services it provides to  its Medicare enrollees under the provisions of Sec. 417.440 (b)(2) or  (b)(3); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refinance prior contract period losses or to avoid losses in the  upcoming contract period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form of payment. Payment of monies withdrawn from a benefit  stabilization fund is made, in equal parts, as an additional amount to  the monthly advance payment made to the HMO or CMP under Sec. 417.584  during the period of the contract.
