(1) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each

Bank shall use an internal market risk model that estimates the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including any related options, and measures the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk of its assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including related options, from all sources of the Bank's market risks, except that the Bank's model need only incorporate those risks that are material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each

Bank shall use an internal market risk model that estimates the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including any related options, and measures the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk of its assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including related options, from all sources of the Bank's market risks, except that the Bank's model need only incorporate those risks that are material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Bank's internal market risk model may use any generally accepted measurement technique, such as variance-covariance models, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations, for estimating the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk, provided that any measurement technique used must cover the Bank's material risks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measures of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk shall include the risks arising from the non-linear price characteristics of options and the sensitivity of the market value of options to changes in the volatility of the options' underlying rates or prices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Bank's internal market risk model shall use interest rate and market price scenarios for estimating the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk, but at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Bank's internal market risk model shall provide an estimate of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk such that the probability of a loss greater than that estimated shall be no more than one percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Bank's internal market risk model shall incorporate scenarios that reflect changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, and shape of the yield curve, and changes in market prices, equivalent to those that have been observed over 120-business day periods of market stress. For interest rates, the relevant historical observations should be drawn from the period that starts at the end of the previous month and goes back to the beginning of 1978;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of, and specific historical observations identified by the Bank as, stress scenarios shall be:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Satisfactory to the Finance Board;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Representative of the periods of the greatest potential market stress given the Bank's portfolio, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Comprehensive given the modeling capabilities available to the Bank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The measure of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk may incorporate empirical correlations among interest rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For any consolidated obligations denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars or linked to equity or commodity prices, each Bank shall, in addition to fulfilling the criteria of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, calculate an estimate of the market value of its portfolio at risk due to the material foreign exchange, equity price or commodity price risk, such that, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The probability of a loss greater than that estimated shall not exceed one percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The scenarios reflect changes in foreign exchange, equity, or commodity market prices that have been observed over 120-business day periods of market stress, as determined using historical data that is from an appropriate period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of, and specific historical observations identified by the Bank as, stress scenarios shall be:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Satisfactory to the Finance Board;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Representative of the periods of greatest potential stress given the Bank's portfolio; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Comprehensive given the modeling capabilities available to the Bank; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The measure of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk may incorporate empirical correlations within or among foreign exchange rates, equity prices, or commodity prices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Independent validation of Bank internal market risk model or internal cash flow model. (1) Each Bank shall conduct an independent validation of its internal market risk model or internal cash flow model within the Bank that is carried out by personnel not reporting to the business line responsible for conducting business transactions for the

Bank. Alternatively, the Bank may obtain independent validation by an outside party qualified to make such determinations. Validations shall be done on an annual basis, or more frequently as required by the Finance Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each Bank shall conduct an independent validation of its internal market risk model or internal cash flow model within the Bank that is carried out by personnel not reporting to the business line responsible for conducting business transactions for the
