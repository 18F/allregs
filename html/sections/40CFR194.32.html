                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance assessments shall consider natural processes and  events, mining, deep drilling, and shallow drilling that may affect the  disposal system during the regulatory time frame.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessments of mining effects may be limited to changes in the  hydraulic conductivity of the hydrogeologic units of the disposal system  from excavation mining for natural resources. Mining shall be assumed to  occur with a one in 100 probability in each century of the regulatory  time frame. Performance assessments shall assume that mineral deposits  of those resources, similar in quality and type to those resources  currently extracted from the Delaware Basin, will be completely removed  from the controlled area during the century in which such mining is  randomly calculated to occur. Complete removal of such mineral resources  shall be assumed to occur only once during the regulatory time frame.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance assessments shall include an analysis of the effects  on the disposal system of any activities that occur in the vicinity of  the disposal system prior to disposal and are expected to occur in the  vicinity of the disposal system soon after disposal. Such activities  shall include, but shall not be limited to, existing boreholes and the  development of any existing leases that can be reasonably expected to be  developed in the near future, including boreholes and leases that may be  used for fluid injection activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance assessments need not consider processes and events  that have less than one chance in 10,000 of occurring over 10,000 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any compliance application(s) shall include information which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifies all potential processes, events or sequences and  combinations of processes and events that may occur during the  regulatory time frame and may affect the disposal system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the processes, events or sequences and combinations  of processes and events included in performance assessments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documents why any processes, events or sequences and  combinations of processes and events identified pursuant to paragraph  (e)(1) of this section were not included in performance assessment  results provided in any compliance application.</p>
