The purpose of this subpart B of part 1204  is to establish requirements that manufacturers and importers must  follow to certify that their products comply with the Safety Standard  for Omnidirectional CB base Station Antennas (16 CFR part 1204, subpart  A). Private labelers of CB antennas subject to the standard need not  issue a certificate of compliance if they have been furnished a  certificate issued by the manufacturer or importer of the antennas. This  subpart B describes the minimum features of a reasonable testing program  and includes requirements for recordkeeping.</p>
