The  international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary  entrance of an accessible facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This section does not require the agency to take any action that  it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the  nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative  burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the  proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or  would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency  has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 2490.160 would  result in such alteration or burdens.   The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens  must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering  all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of  the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written  statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action  required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration  or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not  result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless  ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps  receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
