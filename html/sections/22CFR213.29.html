                            <p class="depth0">The CFO may suspend or terminate the Agency's collection actions on a debt where the outstanding debt principal does not exceed $100,000. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ delegations or procedures, the CFO refers requests for suspension of debts exceeding $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of

Justice, for approval. If prior to referral to DOJ, USAID determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the agency may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence. The CFO may waive the assessment of interest, penalty charges and administrative costs during the period of the suspension. Suspension will be for an established time period and generally will be reviewed at least every six months to ensure the continued propriety of the suspension.</p>
