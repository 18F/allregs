                            <p class="depth0">The term transaction means a proposed or completed merger, acquisition, or takeover. It includes:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The acquisition of an ownership interest in an entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The acquisition or conversion of convertible voting instruments of an entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The acquisition of proxies from holders of a voting interest in an entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A merger or consolidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The formation of a joint venture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A long-term lease under which a lessee makes substantially all business decisions concerning the operation of a leased entity, as if it were the owner.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 800.224(b):</p><p class="depth2">See Sec. 800.304 regarding factors the Committee will consider in determining whether to include the rights to be acquired by a foreign person upon the conversion of convertible voting instruments as part of the Committee's assessment of whether a transaction that involves such instruments is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, signs a concession agreement to operate the toll road business of Corporation B, a U.S. business, for 99 years. Corporation B, however, is required under the agreement to perform safety and security functions with respect to the business and to monitor compliance by Corporation A with the operating requirements of the agreement on an ongoing basis. Corporation B may terminate the agreement or impose other penalties for breach of these operating requirements. Assuming no other relevant facts, this is not a transaction.</p>
