If an LEA  exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the LEA  must use an amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures  under paragraph (a) of this section to carry out activities that could  be supported with funds under the ESEA regardless of whether the LEA is  using funds under the ESEA for those activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this  section, if an SEA determines that an LEA is unable to establish and  maintain programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of section 613(a)  of the Act and this part or the SEA has taken action against the LEA  under section 616 of the Act and subpart F of these regulations, the SEA  must prohibit the LEA from reducing the level of expenditures under  paragraph (a) of this section for that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule. The amount of funds expended by an LEA for early  intervening services under Sec. 300.226 shall count toward the maximum  amount of expenditures that the LEA may reduce under paragraph (a) of  this section.
