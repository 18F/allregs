                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A vessel must have two independent means of controlling each propulsion engine. Control must be provided for the engine speed, direction of shaft rotation, and engine shutdown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One of the means may be the ability to readily disconnect the remote engine control linkage to permit local operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A multiple engine vessel with independent remote propulsion control

for each engine need not have a second means of controlling each engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), a vessel must have a reliable means for shutting down a propulsion engine, at the main pilothouse control station, which is independent of the engine's speed control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A propulsion engine control system, including pilothouse control, must be designed so that a loss of power to the control system does not result in an increase in shaft speed or propeller pitch.</p>
