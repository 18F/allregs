                                Sec. 7.32  What time limits apply to a requester when appealing DOT's
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em>, and of the right to appeal the determination within  DOT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> or Sec. 7.43(c), DOT provides the requester with written  notification of that determination and of the right to appeal the  determination within DOT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, DOT provides the requester with written notice of that  determination and of the right to appeal the determination within DOT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Right to administrative appeal. Any requester to whom a record  has not been made available within the time limits established by Sec.  7.31 and any requester who has been provided a written determination  pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section may appeal to  the responsible DOT official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each appeal must be made in writing to the appropriate DOT  appeal official and postmarked or, in the case of electronic or  facsimile transmissions transmitted, within forty-five calendar days  from the date the initial determination is signed and should include the  DOT file or reference number assigned to the request and all information  and arguments relied upon by the person making the request. The contact  information for all DOT component appeal officials is identified in the  DOT FOIA Reference Guide. The envelope in which a mailed appeal is sent  or the subject line of an appeal sent electronically or by facsimile  should be prominently marked: ``FOIA Appeal.'' The twenty Federal  working day limit described in Sec. 7.33(a) will not begin to run until  the appeal has been received by the appropriate office and identified as  an appeal under FOIA, or would have been so identified with the exercise  of due diligence, by a DOT employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever the responsible DOT official determines it is  necessary, the official may require the requester to furnish additional  information, or proof of factual allegations, and may order other  proceedings appropriate in the circumstances. DOT's time limit for  responding to an appeal may be extended as provided in Sec. 7.34. The  decision of the responsible DOT official as to the availability of the  record, the appropriateness of a fee waiver or reduction, or the  appropriateness of expedited processing, constitutes final agency action  for the purpose of judicial review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The decision of the responsible DOT official to deny a record  request, to deny a request for a fee waiver or reduction, or to deny a  request for expedited processing is considered to be a denial by the  Secretary for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the responsible DOT official denies an appeal, the  requester is informed in writing of the reasons for the denial of the  request and the names and titles or positions of each person responsible  for the determination, and that judicial review of the determination is  available in the United States District Court for the judicial district  in which the requester resides or has his or her principal place of  business, the judicial district in which the requested records are  located, or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to judicial review. Any requester who has not received an  initial determination on his or her request within the time limits  established by Sec. 7.31 can seek immediate judicial review, which may  be sought without the need to first submit an administrative appeal. Any  requester who has received a written determination denying his or her  administrative appeal or who has not received a written determination of  his or her administrative appeal within the time limits established by  Sec. 7.33 can seek judicial review. A determination that a record  request is denied, that a request for a fee waiver or reduction is  denied, and/or that a request for expedited processing is denied does  not constitute final agency action for the purpose of judicial review  unless it is made by the responsible DOT official. Judicial review may  be sought in the United States District Court for the judicial district  in which the requester resides or has his or her principal place of  business, the judicial district in which the requested records are  located, or the District of Columbia.</p>
