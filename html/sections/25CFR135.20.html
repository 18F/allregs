                            <p class="depth0">In addition to 4,751.5 acres of non-Indian land included within the  two irrigation Districts dealt with in subpart A, there are 3,237.6  acres of land, more or less, in non-Indian ownership under private  ditches, covered by repayment contracts executed pursuant to the act of  June 28, 1946 (60 Stat. 333-338), obligating such owners to pay their  proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge  against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre  rate of $0.6595. For the purposes of this notice the annual per acre  rate is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual rate of assessment will  continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of  construction cost of $210,726 is to be repaid without interest. The  amount of each annual installment chargeable against the lands covered  by each of the several contracts with individual landowners whose lands  are served under private ditches, shall be determined by multiplying the  total acreage, under each contract entitled to Willow Creek storage  rights, either directly or by substitution, by the per acre annual rate.  Against the amounts due annually by the individual landowners whose  lands are served by private ditches, under this notice there shall be  allowed any credits due under section 6 of the act of June 28, 1946.  Credits due on behalf of any land shall be reflected in any statement  submitted to the landowners.</p>
