                                Sec. 1.408-1  General rules.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 408 prescribes rules relating to individual  retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities. In addition to  the rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.408-2 and 1.408-3, relating  respectively to individual retirement accounts and individual retirement  annuities, the rules set forth in this section shall also apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from tax. The individual retirement account or  individual retirement annuity is exempt from all taxes under subtitle A  of the Code other than the taxes imposed under section 511, relating to  tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc., organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sanctions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess contributions. If an individual retirement  account or individual retirement annuity accepts and retains excess  contributions, the individual on whose behalf the account is established  or who is the owner of the annuity will be subject to the excise tax  imposed by section 4973.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibited transactions by owner or beneficiary of individual  retirement account--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under section 408(e)(2), if, during any taxable  year of the individual for whose benefit any individual retirement  account is established, that individual or the individual's beneficiary  engages in any transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to  such account, such account ceases to be an individual retirement account  as of the first day of such taxable year. In any case in which any  individual retirement account ceases to be an individual retirement  account by reason of the preceding sentence as of the first day of any  taxable year, section 408(d)(1) applies as if there were a distribution  on such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value (on such  first day) of all assets in the account (on such first day). The  preceding sentence applies even though part of the fair market value of  the individual retirement account as of the first day of the taxable  year is attributable to excess contributions which may be returned tax- free under section 408(d)(4) or 408(d)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the trust with which the individual engages in any  transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is  established by an employer or employee association under section 408(c),  only the employee who engages in the prohibited transaction is subject  to disqualification of his separate account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prohibited transaction by person other than owner or beneficiary  of account. If any person other than the individual on whose behalf an  individual retirement account is established or the individual's  beneficiary engages in any transaction prohibited by section 4975 with  respect to such account, such person shall be subject to the taxes  imposed by section 4975.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, if,  during any taxable year of the individual for whose benefit an  individual retirement account is established, that individual uses the  account or any portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so  used is treated as distributed to that individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Borrowing on annuity contract. Under section 408(e)(3), if  during any taxable year the owner of an individual retirement annuity  borrows any money under or by use of such contract, the contract ceases  to be an individual retirement annuity as of the first day of such  taxable year. See Sec. 1.408-3(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Premature distributions. If a distribution (whether a deemed  distribution or an actual distribution) is made from an individual  retirement account, or individual retirement annuity, to the individual  for whose benefit the account was established, or who is the owner of  the annuity, before the individual attains age 59\1/2\ (unless the  individual has become disabled within the meaning of section 72(m)(7)),  the tax under Chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which such  distribution is received is increased under section 408(f)(1) or (f)(2).  The increase equals 10 percent of the amount of the distribution which  is includible in gross income for the taxable year. Except in the case  of the credits allowable under section 31, 39, or 42, no credit can be  used to offset the increased tax described in this subparagraph. See,  however, Sec. 1.408-4(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on contributions and benefits. An individual  retirement account or individual retirement annuity is subject to the  limitation on contributions and benefits imposed by section 415 for  years beginning after December 31, 1975.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Community property laws. Section 408 shall be applied without  regard to any community property laws.  [T.D. 7714, 45 FR 52790, Aug. 8, 1980]</p>
