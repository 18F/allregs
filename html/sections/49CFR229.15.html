                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Design and operation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each locomotive equipped with a  locomotive control unit (LCU) shall respond only to the operator control  units (OCUs) assigned to that receiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If one or more OCUs are assigned to a LCU, the LCU shall respond  only to the OCU that is in primary command. If a subsequent OCU is  assigned to a LCU, the previous assignment will be automatically  cancelled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If more than one OCU is assigned to a LCU, the secondary OCUs'  man down feature, bell, horn, and emergency brake application functions  shall remain active. The remote control system shall be designed so that  if the signal from the OCU to the RCL is interrupted for a set period  not to exceed five seconds, the remote control system shall cause:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A full service application of the locomotive and train brakes;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The elimination of locomotive tractive effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each OCU shall be designed to control only one RCL at a time.  OCU's having the capability to control more than one RCL shall have a  means to lock in one RCL ``assignment address'' to prevent simultaneous  control over more than one locomotive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an OCU is equipped with an ``on'' and ``off'' switch, when  the switch is moved from the ``on'' to the ``off'' position, the remote  control system shall cause:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A full service application of the locomotive train brakes; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The elimination of locomotive tractive effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each RCL shall have a distinct and unambiguous audible or visual  warning device that indicates to nearby personnel that the locomotive is  under active remote control operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When the main reservoir pressure drops below 90 psi while the  RCL is moving, the RCL shall initiate a full service application of the  locomotive and train brakes, and eliminate locomotive tractive effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When the air valves and the electrical selector switch on the  RCL are moved from manual to remote control mode or from remote control  to manual mode, an emergency application of   the locomotive and train brakes shall be initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Operating control handles located in the RCL cab shall be  removed, pinned in place, protected electronically, or otherwise  rendered inoperable as necessary to prevent movement caused by the RCL's  cab controls while the RCL is being operated by remote control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The RCL system (both the OCU and LCU), shall be designed to  perform a self diagnostic test of the electronic components of the  system. The system shall be designed to immediately effect a full  service application of the locomotive and train brakes and the  elimination of locomotive tractive effort in the event a failure is  detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Each RCL shall be tagged at the locomotive control stand  throttle indicating the locomotive is being used in a remote control  mode. The tag shall be removed when the locomotive is placed back in  manual mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Each OCU shall have the following controls and switches and  shall be capable of performing the following functions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directional control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Throttle or speed control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Locomotive independent air brake application and release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic train air brake application and release control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Audible warning device control (horn);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Audible bell control, if equipped;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Sand control (unless automatic);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Bi-directional headlight control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Emergency air brake application switch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Generator field switch or equivalent to eliminate tractive  effort to the locomotive;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Audio/visual indication of wheel slip, only if an audio/visual  indication is not provided by the RCL;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Activate the audio indication of movement that is located on  the RCL for a duration of at least 3 seconds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Require at least two separate actions by the RCO to begin  movement of the RCL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Each OCU shall be equipped with the following features:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A harness with a breakaway safety feature;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An operator alertness device that requires manual resetting or  its equivalent. The alertness device shall incorporate a timing sequence  not to exceed 60 seconds. Failure to reset the switch within the timing  sequence shall cause a service application of the locomotive and train  brakes, and the elimination of locomotive tractive effort; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A tilt feature that, when tilted to a predetermined angle,  shall cause:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An emergency application of the locomotive and train brakes, and  the elimination of locomotive tractive effort; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the OCU is equipped with a tilt bypass system that permits  the tilt protection feature to be temporarily disabled, this bypass  feature shall deactivate within 60 seconds on the primary OCU and within  60 seconds for all secondary OCUs, unless reactivated by the RCO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Each OCU shall be equipped with one of the following control  systems:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An automatic speed control system with a maximum 15 mph speed  limiter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A graduated throttle and brake. A graduated throttle and brake  control system built after September 6, 2012, shall be equipped with a  speed limiter to a maximum of 15 mph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> RCL systems built after September 6, 2012, shall be equipped to  automatically notify the railroad in the event the RCO becomes  incapacitated or OCU tilt feature is activated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> RCL systems built prior to September 6, 2012, not equipped with  automatic notification of operator incapacitated feature may not be  utilized in one-person operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection, testing, and repair. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each time an OCU is linked  to a RCL, and at the start of each shift, a railroad shall test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The air brakes and the OCU's safety features, including the tilt  switch and alerter device; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The man down/tilt feature automatic notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An OCU shall not continue in use with any defective safety  feature identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A defective OCU shall be tracked under its own identification  number assigned by the railroad. Records of repairs shall be maintained  by the railroad and made available to FRA upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each time an RCL is placed in service and at the first practical  time after the start of each shift, but no more than 2 hours after the  start of that shift, locomotives that utilize a positive train stop  system, such as remote control pullback protection, shall perform a  conditioning run over a track that the positive train stop system is  being utilized on to ensure that the system functions as intended.
