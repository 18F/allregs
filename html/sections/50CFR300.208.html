These procedures shall not apply to fish or fish  products from identified nations that have received either a negative or  a positive certification under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary of  Commerce may allow entry of fish or fish products on a shipment-by- shipment, shipper-by-shipper, or other basis if the Secretary determines  that imports were harvested by practices that do not result in bycatch  of a protected marine species, or were harvested by practices that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are comparable to those of the United States, taking into  account different conditions, and which, in the case of pelagic longline  fisheries, the regulatory program of an identified nation includes  mandatory use of circle hooks, careful handling and release equipment,  and training and observer programs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include the gathering of species specific data that can be used  to support international and regional assessments and conservation  efforts for protected living marine resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to any other import documentation requirements that  otherwise apply, fish and fish products offered for entry under this  section must be accompanied by certification of admissibility, for which  a form is available from NMFS. The certification of admissibility must  be properly completed and signed by a duly authorized official of the  identified nation and must be validated by a responsible official(s)  designated by NMFS. The certification must also be signed by the  importer of record and submitted to NMFS in a format (electronic  facsimile (fax), the Internet, etc.) specified by NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any action recommended under this section shall be consistent  with international obligations, including the WTO Agreement.
