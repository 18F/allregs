                            <p class="depth0">Every manufacturer of tobacco products shall keep a supporting record of tobacco products transferred in bond to or received in bond from other factories, and shall make the entries therein at the time of each receipt or removal of such products. Such supporting records shall show the date of receipt or removal, the name of the manufacturer and address of the factory from which received or to which removed or the permit number of such factory, and the kind and quantity of tobacco products. Where the manufacturer keeps, at the factory, copies of invoices or other commercial records containing the information required as to each receipt and removal, in such orderly manner that the information may be readily ascertained therefrom, such copies will be considered the supporting record required by this section.
