(1) The employer shall ensure that the vessel's steam piping system, including hoses, is designed to safely handle the working pressure prior to supplying steam from an outside source. The employer shall obtain a written or oral determination from a responsible vessel's representative, a contractor, or any other person who is qualified by training, knowledge, or experience to make such determination that the working pressure of the vessel's steam piping system is safe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall ensure that the vessel's steam piping system, including hoses, is designed to safely handle the working pressure prior to supplying steam from an outside source.

the employer shall take the following precautions prior to energizing any of the vessel's circuits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that the vessel is grounded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equip each circuit to be energized with over-current protection that does not exceed the rated current-carrying capacity of the conductors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that each circuit to be energized is in a safe condition. The employer must obtain a determination of the safe condition, either orally or in writing, from a responsible vessel's representative, a contractor, or any other person who is qualified by training, knowledge, or experience to make such determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Heat lamps.
