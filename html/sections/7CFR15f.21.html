                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who may appear at the hearing? You may appear at the hearing in  person or through your attorney. OCR or the agency will appear through a  designated representative, which may include a USDA attorney. Any person  who appears as counsel must conform to the standards of ethical conduct  required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What happens if I fail to show up? If, after having received  notice of the hearing under Sec. 15f.14, you fail to appear at the  hearing without good cause, you will have waived your right to a hearing  in the proceeding and the ALJ may proceed to issue a final determination  based on the written record as provided for under Sec. 15f.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Which party presents its case first at the hearing? You, as the  complainant, will proceed first at the proceeding, unless otherwise  determined by the ALJ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What kind of evidence will be admitted and how will it be  handled?--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The hearing will be conducted by the ALJ in  the manner he or she determines most likely to obtain the facts relevant  to the matter or matters at issue. The ALJ may confine the presentation  of facts and evidence to pertinent matters and exclude irrelevant,  immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information, or questions.  Each party will have the opportunity to present oral and documentary  evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in support of the  party's position; controvert evidence relied on by any other party; and  question all witnesses. The testimony of witnesses at a hearing will be  on oath or affirmation and will be subject to cross-examination. Any  evidence may be received by the ALJ without regard to whether that  evidence could be admitted in judicial proceedings. Upon a finding of  good cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately  and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to  the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objections. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a party objects to the admission of any  evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross- examination or to any other ruling of the ALJ, the party   must state briefly the grounds of such objection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Only objections made before the ALJ may subsequently be relied  upon in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Depositions. The deposition of any witness will be admitted in  the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 15f.18(c)  of these rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exhibits. Unless the ALJ finds that the furnishing of copies is  impracticable, two copies of each exhibit must be filed with the ALJ. A  party submitting an exhibit must provide every other party (except  interested parties) a copy of the exhibit one week before the hearing. A  true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Official records or documents. An official government record or  document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, will be  admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or  prepared the same, and will be prima facie evidence of the relevant  facts stated therein. Such record or document must be evidenced by an  official publication thereof or a copy certified by a person having  legal authority to make such certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Official notice. Official notice will be taken of such matters  as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any  other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established  character if the parties are given adequate notice of matters so  noticed, and the parties will be given adequate opportunity to show that  such facts are erroneously noticed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded by the ALJ, the  party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which must be  included in the transcript. The offer of proof should consist of a brief  statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of  a brief oral statement, it must be included in the transcript in its  entirety. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it must be marked for  identification and inserted in the hearing record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Interlocutory review. Interlocutory review of rulings by the ALJ  will not be permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Transcript or recording. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hearings to be conducted by  telephone will be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device.  Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or by the personal  attendance of parties and witnesses must be transcribed, unless the ALJ  finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding  and the ALJ orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The ALJ must  certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any  recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were  accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the  transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the ALJ determines  that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a  transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the ALJ shall order the  verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The costs of transcription or verbatim recordings will be paid  for by USDA and charged to the agency whose action gave rise to the  complaint at issue. Copies of recordings or transcripts of hearings will  be made available to any party at the actual cost of duplication.</p>
