The substance of certain rulings and  interpretations is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a contract for $15,000 or less is subsequently modified to  exceed $15,000, the contract becomes subject to the statute for work  performed after the date of the modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a contract for more than $15,000 is subsequently modified by  mutual agreement to $15,000 or less, the contract is not subject to the  statute for work performed after the date of the modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a contract awarded to a prime contractor contains a provision  whereby the prime contractor is made an agent of the Government, the  prime contractor is required to include the stipulations of the statute  in contracts in excess of $15,000 awarded for and on behalf of the  Government for supplies that are to be used in the construction and  equipment of Government facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a contract subject to the statute is awarded to a contractor  operating Government-owned facilities, the stipulations of the statute  affect the employees of that contractor the same as employees of  contractors operating privately owned facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Indefinite-delivery contracts, including basic ordering  agreements and blanket purchase agreements, are subject to the statute  unless it can be determined in advance that the aggregate amount of all  orders estimated to be placed thereunder for 1 year after the effective  date of the agreement will not exceed $15,000. A determination shall be  made annually thereafter if the contract or agreement is extended, and  the contract or agreement modified if necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [48 FR 42258, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 75 FR 53133, Aug. 30, 2010;  79 FR 24205, Apr. 29, 2014]    22.606-22.607  [Reserved]</p>
