                            <p class="depth0">The ARP shall meet on a regular schedule and may take action when a  simple majority of the total membership is present. Issues shall be  decided by a majority of the members present. In all cases of a divided  vote, before the decision of the ARP becomes final, any member of the  ARP may by written memorandum to the Executive Secretary of the ARP,  refer such matters   to the Director, Information Management Services (D/IMS) for decision.  In the event of a disagreement with any decision by D/IMS, Directorate  heads may appeal to the Associate Deputy Director, CIA (ADD) for  resolution. The final Agency decision shall reflect the vote of the ARP,  unless changed by the D/IMS or the ADD.  [76 FR 59035, Sept. 23, 2011]</p>
