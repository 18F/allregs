                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the preparation of the profile graphs previously described,  and in determining the location and height above mean sea level of the  antenna site, the elevation or contour intervals shall be taken from  United States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps, United  States Army Corps of Engineers Maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps,  whichever is the latest, for all areas for which such maps are  available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the  next best topographic information should be used. Topographic data may  sometimes be obtained from state and municipal agencies. The data from  the Sectional Aeronautical Charts (including bench marks) or railroad  depot elevations and highway elevations from road maps may be used where  no better information is available. In cases where limited topographic  data can be obtained, use may be made of an altimeter in a car driven  along roads extending generally radially from the transmitter site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission will not ordinarily require the submission of  topographical maps for areas beyond 24 km (15 miles) from the antenna  site, but   the maps must include the principal city or cities to be served. If it  appears necessary, additional data may be requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The U.S. Geological Survey Topography Quadrangle Sheets may be  obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey Department of the Interior,  Washington, DC 20240. The Sectional Aeronautical Charts are available  from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce,  Washington, DC 20235. These maps may also be secured from branch offices  and from authorized agents or dealers in most principal cities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer  generated except in cases of dispute, using elevations from a 30 second,  point or better topographic data file. The file must be identified and  the data processed for intermediate points along each radial using  linear interpolation techniques. The height above mean sea level of the  antenna site must be obtained manually using appropriate topographic  maps.
