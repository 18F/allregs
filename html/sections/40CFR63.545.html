                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>  through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plant roadways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plant buildings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accidental releases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Battery storage area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Equipment maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Material storage areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Material handling areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must submit the standard operating procedures manual to the  Administrator or delegated authority for review and approval when  initially developed and any time changes are made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleaning. Where a cleaning practice is specified, you must clean  by wet wash or a vacuum equipped with a filter rated by the manufacturer  to achieve 99.97 percent capture efficiency for 0.3 micron particles in  a manner that does not generate fugitive lead dust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plant roadways and paved areas. You must pave all areas subject  to vehicle traffic and you must clean the pavement twice per day, except  on days when natural precipitation makes cleaning unnecessary or when  sand or a similar material has been spread on plant roadways to provide  traction on ice or snow. Limited access and limited use roadways such as  unpaved roads to remote locations on the property may be exempt from  this requirement if they are used infrequently (no more than one round  trip per day).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accidental releases. You must initiate cleaning of all affected  areas within one hour after detection of any accidental release of lead  dust that exceeds 10 pounds (the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) reportable quantity for lead at  40 CFR 302.4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Battery storage areas. You must inspect any batteries that are  not stored in a total enclosure once each week and move any broken  batteries to an enclosure within 72 hours of identification. You must  clean residue from broken batteries within 72 hours of identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Materials storage and handling areas. You must wash each vehicle  at each exit of the material storage and handling areas. The vehicle  wash must include washing of tires, undercarriage and exterior surface  of the vehicle followed by vehicle inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Equipment maintenance. You must perform all maintenance  activities that could generate lead dust in a manner that minimizes  emissions of fugitive dust. This must include one or more of the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performing maintenance inside a total permanent enclosure  maintained at negative pressure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Performing maintenance inside a temporary enclosure and use a  vacuum system either equipped with a filter rated by the manufacturer to  achieve a capture efficiency of 99.97 percent for 0.3 micron particles  or routed to an existing control device permitted for this activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Performing maintenance inside a partial enclosure and use of  wet suppression sufficient to prevent dust formation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Decontamination of equipment prior to removal from an  enclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Immediate repair of ductwork or structure leaks without an  enclosure if the time to construct a temporary enclosure would exceed  the time to make a temporary or permanent repair, or if construction of  an enclosure would cause a higher level of emissions than if an  enclosure were not constructed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Activities required for inspection of fabric filters and  maintenance of filters that are in need of removal and replacement are  not required to be conducted inside of total enclosures. Used fabric  filters must be placed in sealed plastic bags or containers prior to  removal from a baghouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Material transport. You must collect and transport all lead  bearing dust (i.e. lead bearing material which is a dust) within closed  conveyor systems   or in sealed, leak-proof containers unless the collection and transport  activities are contained within a total enclosure. All other lead  bearing material must be contained and covered for transport outside of  a total enclosure in a manner that prevents spillage or dust formation.  Intact batteries and lead ingot product are exempt from the requirement  to be covered for transport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Your standard operating procedures manual must specify that  records be maintained of all pavement cleaning, vehicle washing, and  battery storage inspection activities performed to control fugitive dust  emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must pave all grounds on the facility or plant groundcover  sufficient to prevent wind-blown dust. You may use dust suppressants on  unpaved areas that will not support a groundcover (e.g., roadway  shoulders, steep slopes, limited access and limited use roadways).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), as an alternative to the  requirements specified in this section, you can demonstrate to the  Administrator (or delegated State, local, or Tribal authority) that an  alternative measure(s) is equivalent or better than a practice(s)  described in this section.</p>
