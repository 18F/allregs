Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 838--Recommended Language for Court</p><p class="depth2">Orders Dividing Employee Annuities</p><p class="depth2">This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders  attempting to divide employee annuity. A court order directed at  employee annuity should include five elements:</p><p class="depth2">Identification of the benefits;</p><p class="depth2">Instructions that OPM pay the former spouse;</p><p class="depth2">A method for computing the amount of the former  spouse's benefit;</p><p class="depth2">Identification of the type of annuity to which to  apply a fraction, percentage or formula; and</p><p class="depth2">Instructions on what OPM should do if the  employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a  refund of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">The court order may also include instructions for disposition of the  former spouse's share if the former spouse dies before the employee. By  using the model language, courts will know that the court order will  have the effect described in this appendix.</p><p class="depth2">The model language in this appendix does not award a benefit that is  payable after the death of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a  former spouse survivor annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a  benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. Appendix A to  subpart I of this part contains model language for awarding survivor  annuities and contains some examples that award both a portion of an  employee annuity and a survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth2">The model language uses the terms ``[former spouse]'' to identify  the spouse who is receiving a former spouse's portion of an employee  annuity and ``[employee]'' to identify the Federal employee whose  employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the  Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual  court order the appropriate terms, such as ``Petitioner'' and  ``Respondent,'' or the names of the parties should replace ``[former  spouse]'' and ``[employee].''</p><p class="depth2">Similarly, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil  Service Retirement System.

The formula must be stated in the court order (including a court- approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be  incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision  in another case.

For example, an award dividing employee  annuity that uses terms such as ``annuities,'' ``pensions,''  ``retirement benefits,'' or similar general terms, would apply to all  types of employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or  composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must  expressly state that it is directed at ``phased retirement annuity'' or  ``composite retirement annuity,'' and must indicate the share of  employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction. That is, it must  state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., ``net phased retirement  annuity''). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed  at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite  retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased  retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity.</p><p class="depth2">It should be noted that a former spouse survivor annuity cannot be  awarded from a phased retirement annuity; therefore, a phased retirement  annuity is not subject to reduction to provide a former spouse survivor  annuity. As a consequence, an award dividing either ``self-only phased  retirement annuity'' or a ``gross phased retirement annuity'' would be  directed at identical annuities. However, a former spouse survivor  annuity can be awarded from a composite retirement annuity payable to a  phased retiree at entry into full retirement status (i.e., when the  ``phased retiree'' enters full retirement status and becomes a  ``retiree''); therefore, there would be a difference between an award of  a share of ``self-only composite retirement annuity'' and an award of a  share of ``gross composite retirement annuity.''</p><p class="depth2">Due to the complexity of the benefits, care should be taken in  drafting separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite  retirement annuity. It should also be noted, for example, that an award  directed only at   the division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement  annuity payable to a phased retiree will not be effective to divide  annuity payable to an employee who retires in the usual manner, without  having entered phased retirement status first. If separate awards of  phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity are to be  provided, consideration should be given to including provisions in the  paragraph addressing the possibility that the employee may retire in the  usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully  retiring. Similarly, if employee annuity is only to be awarded in the  event the employee retires in the usual manner, without entering phased  retirement status before fully retiring, consideration should be given  to including specific language to that effect.</p><p class="depth2">212 Award of phased retirement annuity and composite  retirement annuity while providing for the possibility that the employee  retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status  before fully retiring.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award phased retirement annuity  and composite retirement annuity and provides for the possibility that  the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased  retirement status:</p><p class="depth2">``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under  the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United  States Government.

Under FERS, section 8452 of title 5, United States Code, provides  a formula for recomputation of disability annuities at age 62 to  approximate an earned annuity. Therefore to award a portion of the  ``earned'' benefit under FERS add the introductory phrase, ``Starting  when [employee] reaches age 62,'' to the paragraph describing how to  compute the amount.</p><p class="depth2">``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under  the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United  State's Government. Starting when [employee] reaches age 62, [former  spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert  ``gross,'' ``net,'' or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil  Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the amount of  [employee]'s monthly annuity computed as though [employee] had retired  on an immediate, nondisability annuity on the commencing date of  [employee]'s annuity based on disability. In computing the amount of the  immediate annuity, the United States Office of Personnel Management will  deem [employee] to have been age 62 at the time that [employee] retired  on disability. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States  Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s  share directly to [former spouse].''</p><p class="depth2">400 Series--Refunds of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">Court orders that award a former spouse a portion of a future  employee annuity of an employee who is not then eligible to retire  should include an additional paragraph containing instructions that tell  OPM what to do if the employee separates before becoming eligible to  retire and requests a refund of employee contributions. The court order  may   award the former spouse a portion of the refund of employee  contributions or bar payment of the refund of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">401 Barring payment of a refund of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will bar payment of the refund of  employee contributions if payment of the refund of employee  contributions would extinguish the former spouse's entitlement to a  portion of the employee annuity. ``The United States Office of Personnel  Management is directed not to pay [employee] a refund of employee  contributions.''</p><p class="depth2">402 Dividing a refund of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will allow the refund of employee  contributions to be paid but will award a prorata share of the refund of  employee contributions to the former spouse. The sentence on the  beginning date of the marriage is unnecessary if the beginning is stated  elsewhere in the order. The award of a prorata share is used only as an  example; the court order could provide another fraction, percentage, or  formula, or a fixed amount. Note that a refund of employee contributions  voids the employee's rights to an employee annuity and the former  spouse's right to any portion of that annuity.</p><p class="depth2">``If [employee] becomes eligible and applies for a refund of  employee contributions, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share  of the refund of employee contributions. The marriage began on [insert  date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to  pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''</p><p class="depth2">500 Series--Death of the former spouse.</p><p class="depth2">501 Full annuity restored to the retiree.</p><p class="depth2">No special provision is necessary to restore the entire annuity to  the retiree upon the death of the former spouse. Unless the court order  expressly provides otherwise, OPM will pay the former spouse's share to  the retiree after the death of the former spouse.</p><p class="depth2">502 Former spouse share paid to children.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse's share  of an employee annuity to the children, including any adopted children,  of the employee and former spouse.</p><p class="depth2">``If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States  Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s  share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to surviving  children of the marriage including any adopted children, in equal  shares. Upon the deaths of any child, that child's share will be  distributed among the other surviving children.''</p><p class="depth2">The language may be modified to terminate the payments to the  children when they reach a stated age. A court order that includes such  a provision for termination must include sufficient information (such as  the children's dates of birth) to permit OPM to determine when the  children's interest terminate. OPM will not consider evidence outside  the court order (and normal OPM files) to establish the children's dates  of birth.</p><p class="depth2">503 Former spouse share paid to the court.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will provide for payment of the former  spouse's share of an employee annuity to the court after the death of  the former spouse. This would allow a court officer to administer the  funds. ``If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States  Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s  share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to this court at  the following address: ``[Insert address where checks should be sent.  The address may be up to six lines and should include sufficient  information for court officials to credit the correct account.]''  [57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46628, Aug. 8, 2014]    Subpart G_Procedures for Processing Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse</p><p class="depth2">Survivor Annuities</p><p class="depth2">Regulatory Structure</p>
