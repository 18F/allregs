                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Partial payments when hardship exists. When claimants suffer a significant, compensable loss of items that are needed for daily living, and can demonstrate a need for immediate funds to replace some of those items (e.g., food, clothes, baby items, etc.) the adjudicating authority may authorize a partial payment of an appropriate amount, normally one-half of the estimated total payment. When a partial payment is made a copy of the payment voucher and all other information related to the partial payment shall be placed in the claim file. Action shall be taken to ensure the amount of the partial payment is deducted from the adjudicated value of the claim when final payment is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Marine hardship payments. The Marine claimant's Transportation Management Office shall ensure compliance with all requirements of Sec. 751.14(a), and may request authority for payment by message from the Commandant of the Marine Corps (MRP-2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of partial payment. Partial payments are to be subtracted from the adjudicated value of the claim before

payment of the balance due. Overpayments are to be properly recouped.
