                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All lessees, contractors, drillers, service companies, pipe pulling and salvaging contractors, or other persons, must at all times conduct their operations and drill, equip, operate, produce, plug, and abandon all wells drilled for oil or gas, service wells or exploratory wells (including seismic, core, and stratigraphic holes) in a manner that will prevent pollution and the migration of oil, gas, salt water, or other substance from one stratum into another, including any fresh water bearing formation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pits for drilling mud or deleterious substances used in the drilling, completion, recompletion, or workover of any well must be constructed and maintained to prevent pollution of surface and subsurface fresh water. These pits must be enclosed with a fence of at least four strands of barbed wire, or an approved substitute, stretched taut to adequately braced corner posts, unless the surface owner, user, or the Superintendent gives consent to the contrary. Immediately after completion of operations, pits must be emptied, reclaimed, and leveled unless otherwise requested by surface owner or user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Drilling pits must be adequate to contain mud and other material extracted from wells and must have adequate storage to maintain a supply of mud for use in emergencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No earthen pit, except those used in the drilling, completion, recompletion or workover of a well, may be constructed, enlarged, reconstructed or used without approval of the Superintendent. Unlined earthen pits may not be used for the storage of salt water or other deleterious substances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deleterious fluids other than fresh water drilling fluids used in drilling or workover operations, which are displaced or produced in well completion or stimulation procedures, including, but not limited to, fracturing, acidizing, swabbing, and drill stem tests, must be collected into a pit lined with plastic of at least 30 mil or a metal or fiberglass tank and maintained separately from above-mentioned drilling fluids to allow for separate disposal. These pits or tanks must be enclosed with a fence of at least four strands of barbed wire, or an approved substitute, stretched taut to adequately braced corner posts, unless the surface owner or the Superintendent gives consent to the contrary. Immediately after completion of operations, tanks must be removed and any pits must be emptied, reclaimed, and leveled unless otherwise requested by surface owner.</p>
