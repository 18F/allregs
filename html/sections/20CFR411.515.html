                                Sec. 411.515  Can the EN change its elected payment system?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes. Any change by an EN in its elected EN payment system will  apply to beneficiaries who assign their ticket to the EN after the EN's  change in election becomes effective. A change in the EN's election will  become effective with the first day of the month following the month in  which the EN notifies us of the change. For beneficiaries who already  assigned their ticket to the EN under the EN's earlier elected payment  system, the EN's earlier elected payment system will continue to apply.  These rules also apply to a change by a State VR agency in its elected  EN payment system for cases in which the State VR agency serves a  beneficiary as an EN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After an EN (or a State VR agency) first elects an EN payment  system, the EN (or State VR agency) can choose to make one change in its  elected payment system in each calendar year (January-December)  thereafter. The first EN payment system election constitutes the only  election an EN may make for that calendar year.  [66 FR 67420, Dec. 28, 2001, as amended at 73 FR 29346, May 20, 2008]</p>
