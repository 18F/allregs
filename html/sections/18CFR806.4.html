                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for activities relating to site evaluation or those authorized under Sec. 806.34, no person shall undertake any of the following projects without prior review and approval by the Commission. The project sponsor shall submit an application in accordance with subpart B and shall be subject to the applicable standards in subpart C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consumptive use of water. Any consumptive use project described below shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with Sec. 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in Sec. 806.22, and, to the extent that it involves a withdrawal from groundwater or surface water, shall also be subject to the standards set forth in Sec. 806.23. Except to the extent that they involve the diversion of the waters of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the requirements of this section. Provided the commission determines that low flow augmentation projects sponsored by the commission's member states provide sufficient mitigation for agricultural water use to meet the standards set forth in Sec. 806.22, and except as otherwise provided below, agricultural water use projects shall not be subject to the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agricultural water use project involving a diversion of the waters of the basin shall be subject to such requirements unless the property, or contiguous parcels of property, upon which the agricultural water use project occurs is located at least partially within the basin.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any project initiated on or after January 23, 1971, involving a consumptive water use of an average of 20,000 gallons per day (gpd) or more in any consecutive 30-day period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to projects previously approved by the Commission for consumptive use, any project that will involve an increase in a consumptive use above that amount which was previously approved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to projects that existed prior to January 23, 1971, any project that increases its consumptive use by an average of 20,000 gpd or more

in any consecutive 30-day period above its pre-compact consumptive use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving a consumptive use of an average of 20,000 gpd or more in any 30-day period, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section or the existing Commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to Sec. 806.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withdrawals. Any project described below shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with Sec. 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in Sec. 806.23. Hydroelectric projects, except to the extent that such projects involve a withdrawal, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding withdrawals; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as exempting hydroelectric projects from review and approval under any other category of project requiring review and approval as set forth in this section, Sec. 806.5, or 18 CFR part 801. The taking or removal of water by a public water supplier indirectly through another public water supply system or another water user's facilities shall constitute a withdrawal hereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any project initiated on or after the applicable dates specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) below, withdrawing a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more from a groundwater or surface water source, or a combination of such sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to projects previously approved by the Commission, any project that increases a withdrawal above that amount which was previously approved and any project that will add a source or increase withdrawals from an existing source which did not require approval prior to January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any project which involves a withdrawal from a groundwater or surface water source and which is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section regarding consumptive use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to groundwater projects in existence prior to July 13, 1978, and surface water projects in existence prior to November 11, 1995, any project that will increase its withdrawal from any source, or initiate a withdrawal from a new source, or combination of sources, by a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more, above that maximum consecutive 30-day amount which the project was withdrawing prior to the said applicable date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving a withdrawal of a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more, from either groundwater or surface water sources, or in combination from both, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section or the existing Commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to Sec. 806.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Diversions. Except with respect to agricultural water use projects not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the projects described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iv) of this section shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with Sec. 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in Sec. 806.24. The project sponsors of out-of-basin diversions shall also comply with all applicable requirements of this part relating to consumptive uses and withdrawals.
