                                Sec. 1.163-7  Deduction for OID on certain debt instruments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an issuer (including a transferee) determines the amount of OID that is deductible each year under section 163(e)(1) by using the constant yield method described in Sec. 1.1272-1(b). This determination, however, is made without regard to section 1272(a)(7) (relating to acquisition premium) and Sec. 1.1273-1(d) (relating to de minimis OID). An issuer is permitted a deduction under section 163(e)(1) only to the extent the issuer is primarily liable on the debt instrument. For certain limitations on the deductibility of OID, see sections 163(e) and 1275(b)(2). To determine the amount of interest (OID) that

is deductible each year on a debt instrument that provides for contingent payments, see Sec. 1.1275-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules for de minimis OID--(1) Stated interest. If a debt instrument has a de minimis amount of OID (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1273-1(d)), the issuer treats all stated interest on the debt instrument as qualified stated interest. See Sec. Sec. 1.446-2(b) and 1.461-1 for the treatment of qualified stated interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stated interest. If a debt instrument has a de minimis amount of OID (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1273-1(d)), the issuer treats all stated interest on the debt instrument as qualified stated interest. See Sec. Sec. 1.446-2(b) and 1.461-1 for the treatment of qualified stated interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deduction of de minimis OID on other than a constant yield basis. In lieu of deducting de minimis OID under the general rule of paragraph (a) of this section, an issuer of a debt instrument with a de minimis amount of OID (other than a de minimis amount treated as qualified stated interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) may choose to deduct the OID at maturity, on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt instrument, or in proportion to stated interest payments. The issuer makes this choice by reporting the de minimis OID in a manner consistent with the method chosen on the issuer's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the debt instrument is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deduction upon repurchase. Except to the extent disallowed by any other section of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., section 249) or this paragraph (c), if a debt instrument is repurchased by the issuer for a price in excess of its adjusted issue price (as defined in Sec. 1.1275-1(b)), the excess (repurchase premium) is deductible as interest for the taxable year in which the repurchase occurs. If the issuer repurchases a debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange, the repurchase price is the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument (reduced by any unstated interest within the meaning of section 483). However, if the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument is determined under either section 1273(b)(4) or section 1274, any repurchase premium is not deductible in the year of the repurchase, but is amortized over the term of the newly issued debt instrument in the same manner as if it were OID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Choice of accrual periods to determine whether a debt instrument is an applicable high yield discount obligation (AHYDO). Section 163(e)(5) affects an issuer's OID deductions for certain high yield debt instruments that have significant OID. For purposes of section 163(i)(2), which defines significant OID, the issuer's choice of accrual periods to determine OID accruals is used to determine whether a debt instrument has significant OID. See Sec. 1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Qualified reopening--(1) In general. In a qualified reopening of an issue of debt instruments, if a holder pays more or less than the adjusted issue price of the original debt instruments to acquire an additional debt instrument, the issuer treats this difference as an adjustment to the issuer's interest expense for the original and additional debt instruments. As provided by paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section, the adjustment is taken into account over the term of the instrument using constant yield principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In a qualified reopening of an issue of debt instruments, if a holder pays more or less than the adjusted issue price of the original debt instruments to acquire an additional debt instrument, the issuer treats this difference as an adjustment to the issuer's interest expense for the original and additional debt instruments. As provided by paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section, the adjustment is taken into account over the term of the instrument using constant yield principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Positive adjustment. If the difference is positive (that is, the holder pays more than the adjusted issue price of the original debt instrument), then, with respect to the issuer but not the holder, the difference increases the aggregate adjusted issue prices of all of the debt instruments in the issue, both original and additional.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Negative adjustment. If the difference is negative (that is, the holder pays less than the adjusted issue price of the original debt instrument), then, with respect to the issuer but not the holder, the difference reduces the aggregate adjusted issue prices of all of the debt instruments in the issue, both original and additional.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination of issuer's interest accruals. As of the reopening date, the issuer must redetermine the yield of the debt instruments in the issue for purposes of applying the constant yield method described in Sec. 1.1272-1(b) to determine the issuer's accruals of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt instruments in the issue. This redetermined yield is based on the aggregate adjusted issue prices of the debt instruments in the issue (as determined under this paragraph (e)) and the remaining payment schedule of the debt instruments in the issue. If the aggregate adjusted issue prices of the

debt instruments in the issue (as determined under this paragraph (e)) are less than the aggregate stated redemption price at maturity of the instruments (determined as of the reopening date) by a de minimis amount (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1273-1(d)), the issuer may use the rules in paragraph (b) of this section to determine the issuer's accruals of interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of adjustments on issuer's adjusted issue price. The adjustments made under this paragraph (e) are taken into account for purposes of determining the issuer's adjusted issue price under Sec. 1.1275-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Definitions. The terms additional debt instrument, original debt instrument, qualified reopening, and reopening date have the same meanings as in Sec. 1.1275-2(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective dates. This section (other than paragraph (e) of this section) applies to debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section (other than paragraph (e) of this section) for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994. Paragraph (e) of this section applies to qualified reopenings where the reopening date is on or after March 13, 2001.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4804, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30138, June 14, 1996; T.D. 8934, 66 FR 2815, Jan. 12, 2001]


Sec. 1.163-8T  Allocation of interest expense among expenditures(temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Application. This section prescribes rules for allocating interest expense for purposes of applying sections 469 (the ``passive loss limitation'') and 163 (d) and (h) (the ``nonbusiness interest limitations'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application. This section prescribes rules for allocating interest expense for purposes of applying sections 469 (the ``passive loss limitation'') and 163 (d) and (h) (the ``nonbusiness interest limitations'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cross-references. This paragraph provides an overview of the manner in which interest expense is allocated for the purposes of applying the passive loss limitation and nonbusiness interest limitations and the manner in which interest expense allocated under this section is treated. See paragraph (b) of this section for definitions of certain terms, paragraph (c) for the rules for allocating debt and interest expense among expenditures, paragraphs (d) and (e) for the treatment of debt repayments and refinancings, paragraph (j) for the rules for reallocating debt upon the occurrence of certain events, paragraph (m) for the coordination of the rules in this section with other limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, and paragraph (n) of this section for effective date and transitional rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of allocation. In general, interest expense on a debt is allocated in the same manner as the debt to which such interest expense relates is allocated. Debt is allocated by tracing disbursements of the debt proceeds to specific expenditures. This section prescribes rules for tracing debt proceeds to specific expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of interest expenses--(i) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (m) of this section (relating to limitations on interest expense other than the passive loss and nonbusiness interest limitations), interest expense allocated under the rules of this section is treated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer A, an individual, incurs interest expense allocated under the rules of this section to the following expenditures:
$6,000 Passive activity expenditure.$4,000 Personal expenditure.

The $6,000 interest expense allocated to the passive activity expenditure is taken into account for purposes of section 469 in computing A's income or loss from the activity to which such interest relates. Pursuant to section 163(h), A may not deduct the $4,000 interest expense allocated to the personal expenditure (except to the extent such interest is qualified residence interest, within the meaning of section 163(h)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation M, a closely held C corporation (within the meaning of section 469 (j)(1)) has $10,000 of interest expense for a taxable year. Under the rules of this section, M's interest expense is allocated to the following expenditures:
$2,000 Passive activity expenditure.$3,000 Portfolio expenditure.$5,000 Other expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 163(d)(3)(D) and this paragraph (a)(4), the $2,000 interest expense allocated to the passive activity expenditure is taken into account in computing M's passive activity loss for the taxable year, but, pursuant to section 469(e)(1) and this paragraph (a)(4), the interest expense allocated to the portfolio expenditure and the other expenditures is not taken into account for such purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Since M is a closely held C corporation, its passive activity loss is allowable under section 469(e)(2)(A) as a deduction from net active income. Under section 469(e)(2)(B) and this paragraph (a)(4), the $5,000 interest expense allocated to other expenditures is taken into account in computing M's net active income, but the interest expense allocated to the passive activity expenditure and the portfolio expenditure is not taken into account for such purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Since M is a corporation, the $3,000 interest expense allocated to the portfolio expenditure is allowable without regard to section 163(d). If M were an individual, however, the interest expense allocated to the portfolio expenditure would be treated as investment interest for purposes of applying the limitation of section 163(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Former passive activity'' means an activity described in section 469(f)(3), but only if an unused deduction or credit (within the meaning of section 469(f)(1) (A) or (B)) is allocable to the activity under section 469(b) for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Former passive activity expenditure'' means an expenditure that is taken into account under section 469 in computing the income or loss from a former passive activity of the taxpayer or an expenditure (including an expenditure properly chargeable to capital account) that would be so taken into account if such expenditure were otherwise deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Investment expenditure'' means an expenditure (other than a passive activity expenditure) properly chargeable to capital account with respect to property held for investment (within the meaning of section 163(d)(5)(A)) or an expenditure in connection with the holding of such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ``Passive activity expenditure'' means an expenditure that is taken into account under section 469 in computing income or loss from a passive activity of the taxpayer or an expenditure (including an expenditure properly chargeable to capital account) that would be so taken into account if such expenditure were otherwise deductible. For purposes of this section, the term ``passive activity expenditure'' does not include any expenditure with respect to any low-income housing project in any taxable year in which any benefit is allowed with respect to such project under section 502 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> ``Personal expenditure'' means an expenditure that is not a trade or business expenditure, a passive activity expenditure, or an investment expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> ``Portfolio expenditure'' means an investment expenditure properly chargeable to capital account with respect to property producing income of a type described in section 469(e)(1)(A) or an investment expenditure for an expense clearly and directly allocable to such income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> ``Trade or business expenditure'' means an expenditure (other than a passive activity expenditure or an investment expenditure) in connection with the conduct of any trade or business other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of debt and interest expense--(1) Allocation in accordance with use of proceeds. Debt is allocated to expenditures in accordance with the use

of the debt proceeds and, except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, interest expense accruing on a debt during any period is allocated to expenditures in the same manner as the debt is allocated from time to time during such period. Except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, debt proceeds and related interest expense are allocated solely by reference to the use of such proceeds, and the allocation is not affected by the use of an interest in any property to secure the repayment of such debt or interest. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer A, an individual, pledges corporate stock held for investment as security for a loan and uses the debt proceeds to purchase an automobile for personal use. Interest expense accruing on the debt is allocated to the personal expenditure to purchase the automobile even though the debt is secured by investment property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation period--(i) Allocation of debt.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (m) of this section, interest expense accruing on a debt for any period is allocated in the same manner as the debt is allocated from time to time, regardless of when the interest is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of compounding. Accrued interest is treated as a debt until it is paid and any interest accruing on unpaid interest is allocated in the same manner as the unpaid interest is allocated. For the taxable year in which a debt is reallocated under the rules in paragraphs (c)(4) and (j) of this section, however, compound interest accruing on such debt (other than compound interest accruing on interest that accrued before the beginning of the year) may be allocated between the original expenditure and the new expenditure on a straight-line basis (i.e., by allocating an equal amount of such interest expense to each day during the taxable year). In addition, a taxpayer may treat a year as consisting of 12 30-day months for purposes of allocating interest on a straight-line basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Accrual of interest expense. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the amount of interest expense that accrues during any period is determined by taking into account relevant provisions of the loan agreement and any applicable law such as sections 163(e), 483, and 1271 through 1275.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, taxpayer B, a calendar year taxpayer, borrows $1,000 at an interest rate of 11 percent, compounded semiannually. B immediately uses the debt proceeds to purchase an investment security. On July 1, B sells the investment security for $1,000 and uses the sales proceeds to make a passive activity expenditure. On December 31, B pays accrued interest on the $1,000 debt for the entire year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under this paragraph (c)(2) and paragraph (j) of this section, the $1,000 debt is allocated to the investment expenditure for the period from January 1 through June 30, and to the passive activity expenditure from July 1 through December 31. Interest expense accruing on the $1,000 debt is allocated in accordance with the allocation of the debt from time to time during the year even though the debt was allocated to the passive activity expenditure on the date the interest was paid. Thus, the $55 interest expense for the period from January 1 through June 30 is allocated to the investment expenditure. In addition, during the period from July 1 through December 31, the interest expense allocated to the investment expenditure is a debt, the proceeds of which are treated as used to make an investment expenditure. Accordingly, an additional $3 of interest expense for the period from July 1 through December 31 ($55x.055) is allocated to the investment expenditure. The remaining $55 of interest expense for the period from July 1 through December 31 ($1,000x.055) is allocated to the passive activity expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternatively, under the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, B may allocate the interest expense on a straight-line basis and may also treat the year as consisting of 12 30-day months for this purpose. In that case, $56.50 of interest expense (180/360x$113) would be allocated to the investment expenditure and the remaining $56.50 of interest expense would be allocated to the passive activity expenditure.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1988, taxpayer C borrows $10,000 at an interest rate of 11 percent, compounded annually. All interest and principal on the debt is payable in a lump sum on December 31, 1992. C immediately uses the debt proceeds to make a passive activity expenditure. C materially participates in the activity in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Therefore, under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (j) of this section, the debt is allocated to a passive activity expenditure from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1989, and to a former passive activity expenditure from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1992. In accordance with the loan agreement (and consistent with Sec. 1.1272-1(d)(1) of the proposed regulations, 51 FR 12022, April 8, 1986), interest expense accruing during any period is determined on the basis of annual compounding. Accordingly, the interest expense on the debt is allocated as follows:

For purposes of this section, a deposit of debt proceeds in an account is treated as an investment expenditure, and amounts held in an account (whether or not interest bearing) are treated as property held for investment. Debt allocated to an account under this paragraph (c)(4)(i) must be reallocated as required by paragraph (j) of this section whenever debt proceeds held in the account are used for another expenditure. This paragraph (c)(4) provides rules for determining when debt proceeds are expended from the account.

Taxpayer C, a calendar year taxpayer, borrows $100,000 on January 1 and immediately uses the proceeds to open a noninterest-bearing checking account. No other amounts are deposited in the account during the year, and no portion of the principal amount of the debt is repaid during the year. On April 1, C uses $20,000 of the debt proceeds held in the account for a passive activity expenditure. On September 1, C uses an additional $40,000 of the debt proceeds held in the account for a personal expenditure. Under this paragraph (c)(4)(i), from January 1 through March 31 the entire $100,000 debt is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account. From April 1 through August 31, $20,000 of the debt is allocated to the passive activity expenditure, and $80,000 of the

debt is allocated to the investment expenditure for the account. From September 1 through December 31, $40,000 of the debt is allocated to the personal expenditure, $20,000 is allocated to the passive activity expenditure, and $40,000 is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenditures from account; general ordering rule.

The $800 personal expenditure is treated as made from the $500 proceeds of Debt A and $300 of the proceeds of Debt B. The $700 passive activity expenditure is treated as made from the remaining $200 proceeds of Debt B and $500 of unborrowed funds. The $800 investment expenditure is treated as made entirely from the proceeds of Debt C. The $600 personal expenditure is treated as made from the remaining $200 proceeds of Debt C and $400 of unborrowed funds. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, debt is allocated to an investment expenditure for periods during which debt proceeds are held in the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Expenditures from account; supplemental ordering rules--(A) Checking or similar accounts. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii), an expenditure from a checking or similar account is treated as made at the time the check is written on the account, provided the check is delivered or mailed to the payee within a reasonable period after the writing of the check. For this purpose, the taxpayer may treat checks written on the same day as written in any order. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a check is presumed to be written on the date appearing on the check and to be delivered or mailed to the payee within a reasonable period thereafter. Evidence to the contrary may include the fact that a check does not clear within a reasonable period after the date appearing on the check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Checking or similar accounts. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii), an expenditure from a checking or similar account is treated as made at the time the check is written on the account, provided the check is delivered or mailed to the payee within a reasonable period after the writing of the check. For this purpose, the taxpayer may treat checks written on the same day as written in any order. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a check is presumed to be written on the date appearing on the check and to be delivered or mailed to the payee within a reasonable period thereafter. Evidence to the contrary may include the fact that a check does not clear within a reasonable period after the date appearing on the check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Expenditures within 15 days after deposit of borrowed funds. The taxpayer may treat any expenditure made from an account within 15 days after debt proceeds are deposited in such account as made from such proceeds to the extent thereof even if under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section the debt proceeds would be treated as used to make one or more other expenditures. Any such expenditures and the debt proceeds from which such expenditures are treated as made are disregarded in applying paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer D incurs a $1,000 debt on June 5 and immediately deposits the proceeds in an account (``Account A''). On June 17, D transfers $2,000 from Account A to another account (``Account B''). On June 30, D writes a $1,500 check on Account B for a passive activity expenditure. In addition, numerous deposits of borrowed and unborrowed amounts and expenditures occur with respect to both accounts throughout the month of June. Notwithstanding these other transactions, D may treat $1,000 of the deposit to Account B on June 17 as an expenditure from the debt proceeds deposited in Account A on June 5. In addition, D may similarly treat $1,000 of the passive activity expenditure on June 30 as made from debt proceeds treated as deposited in Account B on June 17.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in the example in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, except that the proceeds of Debt B are deposited on February 11 rather than on January 11. Since the $700 passive activity expenditure occurs within 15 days after the proceeds of Debt B are deposited in the account, E may treat such expenditure as being made from the proceeds of Debt B to the extent thereof. If E treats the passive activity expenditure in this manner, the expenditures from the account are treated as follows: The $800 personal expenditure is treated as made from the $500 proceeds of

Debt A and $300 of unborrowed funds. The $700 passive activity expenditure is treated as made from the $500 proceeds of Debt B and $200 of unborrowed funds. The remaining expenditures are treated as in the example in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interest on segregated account. In the case of an account consisting solely of the proceeds of a debt and interest earned on such account, the taxpayer may treat any expenditure from such account as made first from amounts constituting interest (rather than debt proceeds) to the extent of the balance of such interest in the account at the time of the expenditure, determined by applying the rules in this paragraph (c)(4). To the extent any expenditure is treated as made from interest under this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C), the expenditure is disregarded in applying paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Optional method for determining date of reallocation. Solely for the purpose of determining the date on which debt allocated to an account under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is reallocated, the taxpayer may treat all expenditures made during any calendar month from debt proceeds in the account as occurring on the later of the first day of such month or the date on which such debt proceeds are deposited in the account. This paragraph (c)(4)(iv) applies only if all expenditures from an account during the same calendar month are similarly treated. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(iv):</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 10, taxpayer G opens a checking account, depositing $500 of proceeds of Debt A and $1,000 of unborrowed funds. The following chart summarizes the transactions which occur during the year with respect to the account (note that these facts are the same as the facts of the example in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section):

Assume that G chooses to apply the optional rule of this paragraph (c)(4)(iv) to all expenditures. For purposes of determining the date on which debt is allocated to the $800 personal expenditure made on February 17, the $500 treated as made from the proceeds of Debt A and the $300 treated as made from the proceeds of Debt B are treated as expenditures occurring on February 1. Accordingly, Debt A is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account from January 10 through January 31 and to the personal expenditure from February 1 through December 31, and $300 of Debt B is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account from January 11 through January 31 and to the personal expenditure from February 1 through December 31. The remaining $200 of Debt B is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account from January 11 through January 31 and to the passive activity expenditure from February 1 through December 31. The $800 of Debt C used to make the investment expenditure on November 24 is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account from June 21 through October 31 and to an investment expenditure from November 1 through December 31. The remaining $200 of Debt C is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account from June 21 through November 30 and to a personal expenditure from December 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Simultaneous deposits--(A) In general.

If two or more debts are incurred simultaneously or are treated under applicable law as incurred simultaneously, the debts are treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(v) as incurred in any order the taxpayer selects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Borrowings on which interest accrues at different rates. If interest does not accrue at the same fixed or variable rate on the entire amount of a borrowing, each portion of the borrowing on which interest accrues at a different fixed or variable rate is treated as a separate debt for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Multiple accounts. The rules in this paragraph (c)(4) apply separately to each account of a taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocation of debt; proceeds received in cash--(i) Expenditure within 15 days of receiving debt proceeds. If a taxpayer receives the proceeds of a debt in cash, the taxpayer may treat any cash expenditure made within 15 days after receiving the cash as made from such

debt proceeds to the extent thereof and may treat such expenditure as made on the date the taxpayer received the cash. The following example illustrates the rule in this paragraph (c)(5)(i):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer F incurs a $1,000 debt on August 4 and receives the debt proceeds in cash. F deposits $1,500 cash in an account on August 15 and on August 27 writes a check on the account for a passive activity expenditure. In addition, F engages in numerous other cash transactions throughout the month of August, and numerous deposits of borrowed and unborrowed amounts and expenditures occur with respect to the account during the same period. Notwithstanding these other transactions, F may treat $1,000 of the deposit on August 15 as an expenditure made from the debt proceeds on August 4. In addition, under the rule in paragraph (c)(4)(v)(B) of this section, F may treat the passive activity expenditure on August 27 as made from the $1,000 debt proceeds treated as deposited in the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other expenditures. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5) (i) and (iii) of this section, any debt proceeds a taxpayer (other than a corporation) receives in cash are treated as used to make personal expenditures. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), debt proceeds are received in cash if, for example, a withdrawal of cash from an account is treated under the rules of this section as an expenditure of debt proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules for certain taxpayers.

[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Debt used to pay interest. To the extent proceeds of a debt are used to pay interest, such debt is allocated in the same manner as the debt on which such interest accrued is allocated from time to time. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, taxpayer H incurs a debt of $1,000, bearing interest at an annual rate of 10 percent, compounded annually, payable at the end of each year (``Debt A''). H immediately opens a checking account, in which H deposits the proceeds of Debt A. No other amounts are deposited in the account during the year. On April 1, H writes a check for a personal expenditure in the amount of $1,000. On December 31, H borrows $100 (``Debt B'') and immediately uses the proceeds of Debt B to pay the accrued interest of $100 on Debt A. From January 1 through March 31, Debt A is allocated, under the rule in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, to the investment expenditure for the account. From April 1 through December 31, Debt A is allocated to the personal expenditure. Under the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, $25 of the interest on Debt A for the year is allocated to the investment expenditure, and $75 of the interest on Debt A for the year is allocated to the personal expenditure. Accordingly, for the purpose of allocating the interest on Debt B for all periods until Debt B is repaid, $25 of Debt B is allocated to the investment expenditure, and $75 of Debt B is allocated to the personal expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Debt used to pay borrowing costs--(A) Borrowing costs with respect to different debt. To the extent the proceeds of a debt (the ``ancillary debt'') are used to pay borrowing costs (other than interest) with respect to another debt (the ``primary debt''), the ancillary debt is allocated in the same manner as the primary debt is allocated from time to time. To the extent the primary debt is repaid, the ancillary debt will continue to be allocated in the same manner as the primary debt was allocated immediately before its repayment. The following example illustrates the rule in this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer I incurs debts of $60,000 (``Debt A'') and $10,000 (``Debt B''). I immediately uses $30,000 of the proceeds of Debt A to make a trade or business expenditure, $20,000 to make a passive activity expenditure, and $10,000 to make an investment expenditure. I immediately use $3,000 of the proceeds of Debt B to pay borrowing costs (other than interest) with respect to Debt A (such as loan origination, loan commitment, abstract, and recording fees) and deposits the remaining $7,000 in an account. Under the rule in this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A), the $3,000 of Debt B used to pay expenses of incurring Debt A is allocated $1,500 to the trade or business expenditure ($3,000 x $30,000/$60,000), $1,000 to the passive activity expenditure ($3,000 x $20,000/$60,000), and $500 ($3,000 x $10,000/$60,000) to the investment expenditure. The manner in which the $3,000 of Debt B used to pay expenses of incurring Debt A is allocated may change if the allocation of Debt A changes, but such allocation will be unaffected by any repayment of Debt A. The remaining $7,000 of Debt B is allocated to an investment expenditure for the account until such time, if any, as this amount is used for a different expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Borrowing costs with respect to same debt. To the extent the proceeds of

a debt are used to pay borrowing costs (other than interest) with respect to such debt, such debt is allocated in the same manner as the remaining debt is allocated from time to time. The remaining debt for this purpose is the portion of the debt that is not used to pay borrowing costs (other than interst) with respect to such debt. Any repayment of the debt is treated as a repayment of the debt allocated under this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) and the remaining debt is the same proportion as such amount bear to each other. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer J borrows $85,000. The lender disburses $80,000 of this amount to J, retaining $5,000 for borrowing costs (other than interest) with respect to the loan. J immediately uses $40,000 of the debt proceeds to make a personal expenditure, $20,000 to make a passive activity expenditure, and $20,000 to make an investment expenditure. Under the rule in this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B), the $5,000 used to pay borrowing costs is allocated $2,500 ($5,000 x $40,000/$80,000) to the personal expenditure, $1,250 ($5,000 x $20,000/$80,000) to the investment expenditure. The manner in which this $5,000 is allocated may change if the allocation of the remaining $80,000 of debt is changed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that J repays $50,000 of the debt. The repayment is treated as a repayment of $2,941 ($50,000 x $5,000/$85,000) of the debt used to pay borrowing costs and a repayment of $47,059 ($50,000 x $80,000/$85,000) of the remaining debt. Under paragraph (d) of this section, J is treated as repaying the $42,500 of debt allocated to the personal expenditure ($2,500 of debt used to pay borrowing costs and $40,000 of remaining debt). In addition, assuming that under paragraph (d)(2) J chooses to treat the allocation to the passive activity expenditure as having occurred before the allocation to the investment expenditure, J is treated as repaying $7,500 of debt allocated to the passive activity expenditure ($441 of debt used to pay borrowing costs and $7,059 of remaining debt).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allocation of debt before actual receipt of debt proceeds.

On January 19 of the following year, B repays $90,000 of Debt A (leaving $10,000 of Debt A outstanding). The $40,000 of Debt A allocated to the personal expenditure, the $40,000 allocated to passive activity expenditure 1, and $10,000 of the $20,000 allocated to passive activity expenditure 2 are treated as repaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer A obtains a line of credit.

The facts are the same as in example (1) except that, instead of receiving all $25,000 of the sale proceeds on January 1, 1988, D receives 5,000 on that date, $10,000 on January 1, 1989, and $10,000 on January 1, 1990. D does not use any portion of the sale proceeds to repay the debt. Between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1988, D is treated under paragraph (j)(3) of this section as making an investment expenditure of $20,000 to which $10,000 of debt is allocated. In addition, the remaining $5,000 of debt is reallocated on January 1, 1988, in accordance with D's use of the sales proceeds received on that

date. Between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1989, D is treated as making an investment expenditure of $10,000 to which no debt is allocated.

The following examples illustrate the relationship between the passive loss and nonbusiness interest limitations and other limitations on the deductibility of interest expense:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Debt is allocated pursuant to the rules in this section to an investment expenditure for the purchase of taxable investment securities. Pursuant to section 265(a)(2), the debt is treated as indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations the interest on which is wholly exempt from Federal income tax, and, accordingly, interest on the debt is disallowed. If section 265(a)(2) subsequently ceases to apply (because, for example, the taxpayer ceases to hold any tax-exempt obligations), and the debt at such time continues to be allocated to an investment expenditure, interest on the debt that accrues after such time is subject to section 163(d).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An accrual method taxpayer incurs a debt payable to a cash method lender who is related to the taxpayer within the meaning of section 267(b). During the period in which interest on the debt is not deductible by reason of section 267(a)(2), the debt is allocated to a passive activity expenditure. Thus, interest that accrues on the debt for such period is also allocated to the passive activity expenditure. When such interest expense becomes deductible under section 267(a)(2), it will be allocated to the passive activity expenditure, regardless of how the debt is allocated at such time.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A taxpayer incurs debt that is allocated under the rules of this section to an investment expenditure. Under section 263A(f), however, interest expense on such debt is capitalized during the production period (within the meaning of section 263A(f)(4)(B)) of property used in a passive activity of the taxpayer. The capitalized interest expense is not allocated to the investment expenditure, and depreciation deductions attributable to the capitalized interest expense are subject to the passive loss limitation as long as the property is used in a passive activity. However, interest expense on the debt for periods after the production period is allocated to the investment expenditure as long as the debt remains allocated to the investment expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other limitations on interest expense--(i) Capitalization provisions.

For 1988, this fraction is equal to 0.875 ($105,000/$120,000). Therefore, $11,200 ($12,800 x 0.875) of the total interest is qualified residence interest. The remaining $1,600 in interest ($12,800 - $11,200) is personal interest, even if (under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T) such remaining interest would be allocated to some other category of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of qualified residence interest when secured debt exceeds adjusted purchase price--Exact method--(1) In general.

Because the average balance of Debt 2 ($40,000) exceeds its applicable debt limit, the amount of qualified residence interest on Debt 2 is determined by multiplying the amount of interest paid on the debt during the year ($4,800) by a fraction equal to its applicable debt limit divided by its average balance ($25,000/$40,000 = 0.625). Accordingly, $3,000 ($4,800 x 0.625) of the interest paid in 1988 on Debt 2 is qualified residence interest.

The balance of the debt is $9,652 on January 1, 1990, and is $9,450 on December 31, 1990. The average balance of the debt during 1990 may be computed as follows:

The adjusted purchase price of the residence is $100,000 throughout 1987, 1988 and 1989. The average balance of the original debt was $150,000 in 1987 and $75,000 in 1988.

This amount is treated as the adjusted purchase price for 1987 and all of the interest paid on the debt is qualified residence interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Grandfathered amount in 1988. Because the replacement debt was used to refinance a debt incurred and secured

Since the sum of the grandfathered amounts ($150,000) exceeds the adjusted purchase price of the residence, the sum of the grandfathered amounts may be substituted for the adjusted purchase price for 1988 and all of the interest paid on the debt is qualified residence interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Grandfathered amount in 1989.

For purposes of paragraph (n)(1)(v)(A) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``combined qualified indebtedness'' means the sum of the qualified indebtedness (determined without regard to paragraph (n)(1)(v) of this section) for the original debt and the replacement debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``combined qualified expenses'' means the amount of the proceeds of the original debt used to pay for qualified medical and educational expenses through the end of the current taxable year, reduced by any principal payments on the debt before the first day of the current taxable year, and increased by the amount, if any, of the proceeds of the replacement debt used to pay such expenses through the end of the current taxable year other than as part of the refinancing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. (i) On August 11, 1987, C incurs a $8,000 debt secured by a principal residence. C uses (within the meaning of paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section) $5,000 of the proceeds of the debt to pay for qualified educational expenses. C makes no principal payments on the debt. On July 1, 1988, C incurs a new debt in the amount of $8,000 secured by C's principal residence and uses all of the proceeds of the new debt to repay the original debt. Under paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section $5,000 of the new debt is treated as being used to pay for qualified educational expenses. C makes no principal payments (other than the refinancing) during 1987 or 1988 on either debt and pays all accrued interest monthly. The average balance of each debt in 1988 is $4,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (n)(1)(iii) of this section, the amount of qualified indebtedness for 1988 with respect to the original debt is $4,000 (the lesser of its average balance ($4,000) and the amount of the debt used to pay for qualified medical and educational expenses ($5,000)). Similarly, the amount of qualified indebtedness for 1988 with respect to the replacement debt is also $4,000. Both debts, however, are subject in 1988 to the limitation in paragraph

(n)(1)(v)(A) of this section. The combined qualified indebtedness, determined without regard to the limitation, is $8,000 ($4,000 of qualified indebtedness from each debt). The combined qualified expenses are $5,000 ($5,000 from the original debt and $0 from the replacement debt). The amount of qualified indebtedness from each debt must, therefore, be reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is $5,000 (the combined qualified expenses) and the denominator of which is $8,000 (the combined qualified indebtedness). After application of the limitation, the amount of qualified indebtedness for the original debt is $2,500 ($4,000 x x \5/8\). Similarly, the amount of qualified indebtedness for the replacement debt is $2,500. Note that the total qualified indebtedness for both the original and the replacement debt is $5,000 ($2,500 + $2,500). Therefore, C is entitled to the same amount of qualified indebtedness as C would have been entitled to if C had not refinanced the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Special rule for principal payments in excess of qualified expenses. For purposes of paragraph (n)(1)(iii)(B), (n)(1)(v)(B)(2) and (n)(2)(ii) of this section, a principal payment is taken into account only to the extent that the payment, when added to all prior payments, does not exceed the amount used on or before the date of the payment to pay for qualified medical and educational expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Debt used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses--(i) In general.

For purposes of this section, the proceeds of a debt are used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer pays qualified medical or educational expenses within 90 days before or after the date that amounts are actually borrowed with respect to the debt, the proceeds of the debt are not directly allocable to another expense under Sec. 1.163-8T(c)(3) (allocation of debt; proceeds not disbursed to borrower) and the proceeds of any other debt are not allocable to the medical or educational expenses under Sec. 1.163-8T(c)(3), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The proceeds of the debt are otherwise allocated to such expenditures under Sec. 1.163-8T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for refinancings. For purposes of this section, the proceeds of a debt are used to pay for qualified medical and educational expenses to the extent that the proceeds of the debt are allocated under Sec. 1.163-8T to the repayment of another debt (the ``original debt''), but only to the extent of the amount of the original debt used to pay for qualified medical and educational expenses, reduced by any principal payments on such debt up to the time of the refinancing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other special rules. The following special rules apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Proceeds of a debt are used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses as of the later of the taxable year in which such proceeds are borrowed or the taxable year in which such expenses are paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of debt which may be treated as being used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses may not exceed the amount of such expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Proceeds of a debt may not be treated as being used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses to the extent that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds have been repaid as of the time the expense is paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The proceeds are actually borrowed before August 17, 1986; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The medical or educational expenses are paid before August 17, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples--</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A pays a $5,000 qualified educational expense from a checking account that A maintains at Bank 1 on November 9, 1987. On January 1, 1988, A incurs a $20,000 debt that is secured by A's residence and places the proceeds of the debt in a savings account that A also maintains at Bank 1. A pays another $5,000 qualified educations expense on March 15 from a checking account that A maintains at Bank 2. Under paragraph (n)(2) of this section, the debt proceeds are used to pay for both educational expenses, regardless of other deposits to, or expenditures from, the accounts, because both expenditures are made within 90 days before or after the debt was incurred.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B pays a $5,000 qualified educational expense from a checking account on November 1, 1987. On November 30, 1987, B incurs a debt secured by B's residence, and the lender disburses the debt proceeds directly to a person who sells B a new car. Although the educational expense is paid within 90 days of

the date the debt is incurred, the proceeds of the debt are not used to pay for the educational expense because the proceeds are directly allocable to the purchase of the new car under Sec. 1.163-8T(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On November 1, 1987, C borrows $5,000 from C's college. The proceeds of this debt are not disbursed to C, but rather are used to pay tuition fees for C's attendance at the college. On November 30, 1987, C incurs a second debt and secures the debt by C's residence. Although the $5,000 educational expense is paid within 90 days before the second debt is incurred, the proceeds of the second debt are not used to pay for the educational expense, because the proceeds of the first debt are directly allocable to the educational expense under Sec. 1.163-8T(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On January 1, 1988, D incurs a $20,000 debt secured by a qualified residence. D places the proceeds of the debt in a separate account (i.e., the proceeds of the debt are the only deposit in the account). D makes payments of $5,000 each for qualified educational expenses on September 1, 1988, September 1, 1989, September 1, 1990, and September 1, 1991. Because the debt proceeds are allocated to educational expenses as of the date the expenses are paid, under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T(c)(4), the following amounts of the debt proceeds are used to pay for qualified educational expenses as of the end of each year:

1988: $5,0001989: $10,0001990: $15,0001991: $20,000</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. During 1987 E incurs a $10,000 debt secured by a principal residence. E uses (within the meaning of paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section) all of the proceeds of the debt to pay for qualified educational expenses. On August 20, 1988, at which time the balance of the debt is $9,500, E incurs a new debt in the amount of $9,500 secured by E's principal residence and uses all of the proceeds of the new debt to repay the original debt. Under paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section, all of the proceeds of the new debt are used to pay for qualified educational expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualified medical expenses. Qualified medical expenses are amounts that are paid for medical care (within the meaning of section 213(d)(1) (A) and (B)) for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 152), and that are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified educational expenses. Qualified educational expenses are amounts that are paid for tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required for enrollment, attendance or courses of instruction at an educational organization described in section 170(b) (1)(A)(ii) and for any reasonable living expenses while away from home while in attendance at such an institution, for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse or a dependent of the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 152) and that are not reimbursed by scholarship or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Secured debt--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, the term ``secured debt'' means a debt that is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the term ``secured debt'' means a debt that is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That makes the interest of the debtor in the qualified residence specific security for the payment of the debt,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under which, in the event of default, the residence could be subjected to the satisfaction of the debt with the same priority as a mortgage or deed of trust in the jurisdiction in which the property is situated, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That is recorded, where permitted, or is otherwise perfected in accordance with applicable State law.
A debt will not be considered to be secured by a qualified residence if it is secured solely by virtue of a lien upon the general assets of the taxpayer or by a security interest, such as a mechanic's lien or judgment lien, that attaches to the property without the consent of the debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for debt in certain States. Debt will not fail to be treated as secured solely because, under an applicable State or local homestead law or other debtor protection law in effect on August 16, 1986, the security interest is ineffective or the enforceability of the security interest is restricted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Times at which debt is treated as secured. For purposes of this section, a debt is treated as secured as of the date on which each of the requirements of paragraph (o)(1) of this section are satisfied, regardless of when amounts are actually borrowed with respect to the debt. For purposes of this paragraph (o)(3), if the instrument is recorded within a commercially reasonable time after the security interest is granted, the instrument will be treated as recorded on the date that the security interest was granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Partially secured debt--(i) In general. If the security interest is limited to a prescribed maximum amount or portion of the residence, and the average balance of the debt exceeds such amount or the value of such portion, such excess shall not be treated as secured debt for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the security interest is limited to a prescribed maximum amount or portion of the residence, and the average balance of the debt exceeds such amount or the value of such portion, such excess shall not be treated as secured debt for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. T borrows $80,000 on January 1, 1991. T secures the debt with a principal residence. The security in the residence for the debt, however, is limited to $20,000. T pays $8,000 in interest on the debt in 1991 and the average balance of the debt in that year is $80,000. Because the average balance of the debt exceeds the maximum amount of the security interest, such excess is not treated as secured debt. Therefore, for purposes of applying the limitation on qualified residence interest, the average balance of the secured debt is $20,000 (the maximum amount of the security interest) and the interest paid or accrued on the secured debt is $2,000 (the total interest paid on the debt multiplied by the ratio of the average balance of the secured debt ($20,000) and the average balance of the total debt ($80,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Election to treat debt as not secured by a qualified residence--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer may elect to treat any debt that is secured by a qualified residence as not secured by the qualified residence. An election made under this paragraph shall be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer may elect to treat any debt that is secured by a qualified residence as not secured by the qualified residence. An election made under this paragraph shall be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. T owns a principal residence with a fair market value of $75,000 and an adjusted purchase price of $40,000. In 1988, debt A, the proceeds of which were used to purchase the residence, has an average balance of $15,000. The proceeds of debt B, which is secured by a second mortgage on the property, are allocable to T's trade or business under Sec. 1.163-8T and has an average balance of $25,000. In 1988, T incurs debt C, which is also secured by T's principal residence and which has an average balance in 1988 of $5,000. In the absence of an election to treat debt B as unsecured, the applicable debt limit for debt C in 1988 under paragraph (e) of this section would be zero dollars ($40,000-$15,000-$25,000) and none of the interest paid on debt C would be qualified residence interest. If, however, T makes or has previously made an election pursuant to paragraph (o)(5)(i) of this section to treat debt B as not secured by the residence, the applicable debt limit for debt C would be $25,000 ($40,000-$15,000), and all of the interest paid on debt C during the taxable year would be qualified residence interest. Since the proceeds of debt B are allocable to T's trade or business under Sec. 1.163-8T, interest on debt B may be deductible under other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of debt secured by two qualified residences. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Definition of qualified residence--(1) In general. The term ``qualified residence'' means the taxpayer's principal residence (as defined in paragraph (p)(2) of this section), or the taxpayer's second residence (as defined in paragraph (p)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``qualified residence'' means the taxpayer's principal residence (as defined in paragraph (p)(2) of this section), or the taxpayer's second residence (as defined in paragraph (p)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Principal residence. The term ``principal residence'' means the taxpayer's principal residence within the meaning of section 1034. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer cannot have more than one principal residence at any one time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Second residence--(i) In general. The term ``second residence'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``second residence'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A residence within the meaning of paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That the taxpayer uses as a residence within the meaning of paragraph (p)(3)(iii) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That the taxpayer elects to treat as a second residence pursuant to paragraph (p)(3)(iv) of this section.
A taxpayer cannot have more than one second residence at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of residence. Whether property is a residence shall be determined based on all the facts and circumstances, including the good faith of the taxpayer. A residence generally includes a house, condominium, mobile home, boat, or house trailer, that contains sleeping space and toilet and cooking facilities. A residence does not include personal property, such as furniture or a television, that, in accordance with the applicable local law, is not a fixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use as a residence. If a residence is rented at any time during the taxable year, it is considered to be used as a residence only if the taxpayer uses it during the taxable year as a residence within the meaning of section 280A(d). If a residence is not rented at any time during the taxable year, it shall be considered to be used as a residence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a residence will be deemed to be rented during any period that the taxpayer holds the residence out for rental or resale or repairs or renovates the residence with the intention of holding it out for rental or resale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election of second residence. A taxpayer may elect a different residence (other than the taxpayer's principal residence) to be the taxpayer's second residence for each taxable year. A taxpayer may not elect different residences as second residences at different times of the same taxable year except as provided below--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the taxpayer acquires a new residence during the taxable year, the taxpayer may elect the new residence as a taxpayer's second residence as of the date acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If property that was the taxpayer's principal residence during the taxable year ceases to qualify as the taxpayer's principal residence, the taxpayer may elect that property as the taxpayer's second residence as of the date that the property ceases to be the taxpayer's principal residence; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If property that was the taxpayer's second residence is sold during the taxable year or becomes the taxpayer's principal residence, the taxpayer may elect a new second residence as of such day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocations between residence and other property--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, the adjusted purchase price and fair market value of property must be allocated between the portion of the property that is a qualified residence and the portion that is not a qualified residence. Neither the average balance of the secured debt nor the interest paid or accrued on secured debt is so allocated. Property that is not used for residential purposes does not qualify as a residence. For example, if a portion of the property is used as an office in the taxpayer's trade or business, that portion of the property does not qualify as a residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the adjusted purchase price and fair market value of property must be allocated between the portion of the property that is a qualified residence and the portion that is not a qualified residence. Neither the average balance of the secured debt nor the interest paid or accrued on secured debt is so allocated. Property that is not used for residential purposes does not qualify as a residence. For example, if a portion of the property is used as an office in the taxpayer's trade or business, that portion of the property does not qualify as a residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for rental of residence. If a taxpayer rents a portion of his or her principal or second residence to another person (a ``tenant''), such portion may be treated as used by the taxpayer for residential purposes if, but only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such rented portion is used by the tenant primarily for residential purposes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rented portion is not a self-contained residential unit containing separate sleeping space and toilet and cooking facilities, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The total number of tenants renting (directly or by sublease) the same or different portions of the residence at any time during the taxable year does not exceed two. For this purpose, if two persons (and the dependents, as defined by section 152, of either of them) share the same sleeping quarters, they shall be treated as a single tenant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D, a dentist, uses a room in D's principal residence as an office which qualifies under section 280A(c)(1)(B) as a portion of the dwelling unit used exclusively on a regular basis as a place of business for meeting with patients in the normal course of D's trade or business. D's adjusted purchase price of the property is $65,000; $10,000 of which is allocable under paragraph (o)(4)(i) of this section to the room used as an office. For purposes of this section, D's residence does not include the room used as an office. The adjusted purchase price of the residence is, accordingly, $55,000. Similarly, the fair market value of D's residence must be allocated between the office and the remainder of the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. J rents out the basement of property that is otherwise used as J's principal residence. The basement is a self-contained residential unit, with sleeping space and toilet and cooking facilities. The adjusted purchase price of the property is $100,000; $15,000 of which is allocable under paragraph (o)(4)(i) of this section to the basement. For purposes of this section, J's residence does not include the basement and the adjusted purchase price of the residence is $85,000. Similarly, the fair market value of the residence must be allocated between the basement unit and the remainder of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Residence under construction--(i) In general. A taxpayer may treat a residence under construction as a qualified residence for a period of up to 24

months, but only if the residence becomes a qualified residence, without regard to this paragraph (p)(5)(i), as of the time that the residence is ready for occupancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer may treat a residence under construction as a qualified residence for a period of up to 24

months, but only if the residence becomes a qualified residence, without regard to this paragraph (p)(5)(i), as of the time that the residence is ready for occupancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. X owns a residential lot suitable for the construction of a vacation home. On April 20, 1987, X obtains a mortgage secured by the lot and any property to be constructed on the lot. On August 9, 1987, X begins construction of a residence on the lot. The residence is ready for occupancy on November 9, 1989. The residence is used as a residence within the meaning of paragraph (p)(3)(iii) of this section during 1989 and X elects to treat the residence as his second residence for the period November 9, 1989, through December 31, 1989. Since the residence under construction is a qualified residence as of the first day that the residence is ready for occupancy (November 9, 1987), X may treat the residence as his second residence under paragraph (p)(5)(i) of this section for up to 24 months of the period during which the residence is under construction, commencing on or after the date that construction is begun (August 9, 1987). If X treats the residence under construction as X's second residence beginning on August 9, 1987, the residence under construction would cease to qualify as a qualified residence under paragraph (p)(5)(i) on August 8, 1989. The residence's status as a qualified residence for future periods would be determined without regard to paragraph (p)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for time-sharing arrangements. Property that is otherwise a qualified residence will not fail to qualify as such solely because the taxpayer's interest in or right to use the property is restricted by an arrangement whereby two or more persons with interests in the property agree to exercise control over the property for different periods during the taxable year. For purposes of determining the use of a residence under paragraph (p)(3)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer will not be considered to have used or rented a residence during any period that the taxpayer does not have the right to use the property or to receive any benefits from the rental of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Special rules for tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, a residence includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation owned by a tenant-stockholder if the house or apartment which the tenant-stockholder is entitled to occupy by virtue of owning such stock is a residence within the meaning of paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, a residence includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation owned by a tenant-stockholder if the house or apartment which the tenant-stockholder is entitled to occupy by virtue of owning such stock is a residence within the meaning of paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule where stock may not be used to secure debt. For purposes of this section, if stock described in paragraph (q)(1) of this section may not be used to secure debt because of restrictions under local or State law or because of restrictions in the cooperative agreement (other than restrictions the principal purpose of which is to permit the tenant-stockholder to treat unsecured debt as secured debt under this paragraph (q)(2)), debt may be treated as secured by such stock to the extent that the proceeds of the debt are allocated to the purchase of the stock under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T. For purposes of this paragraph (q)(2), proceeds of debt incurred prior to January 1, 1987, may be treated as allocated to the purchase of such stock to the extent that the tenant-stockholder has properly and consistently deducted interest expense on such debt as home mortgage interest attributable to such stock on Schedule A of Form 1040 in determining his taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. For purposes of this paragraph (q)(2), amended returns filed after December 22, 1987, are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of interest expense of the cooperative described in section 216(a)(2). For purposes of section 163(h) and Sec. 1.163-9T (disallowance of deduction for personal interest) and section 163(d) (limitation on investment interest), any amount allowable as a deduction to a tenant-stockholder under section 216(a)(2) shall be treated as interest paid or accrued by the tenant-stockholder. If a tenant-stockholder's stock in a cooperative housing corporation is a qualified residence of the tenant-shareholder, any amount allowable as a deduction to the tenant-stockholder under section 216(a)(2) is qualified residence interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule to prevent tax avoidance. If the amount treated as qualified residence interest under this section exceeds the amount which would be so treated if the tenant-stockholder were treated as directly owning his proportionate share of the assets and liabilities of the cooperative and one of the principal purposes of the cooperative arrangement is to permit the tenant-stockholder to increase the amount of qualified residence interest, the district director may determine that such excess is not qualified residence interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms ``tenant-stockholder,'' ``cooperative housing corporation'' and ``proportionate share'' shall have the meaning given by section 216 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
