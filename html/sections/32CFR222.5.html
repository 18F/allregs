                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The DoD Components shall process MDR requests from the  public for classified information originating within the DoD Component  in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R and 32 CFR part 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information not subject to review for public release under the  MDR includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unclassified information (to include documents) or previously  classified documents that are declassified prior to the receipt of the  MDR request. These documents must be requested under the provisions of 5  U.S.C. 552(b) (also known and hereinafter referred to as the ``Freedom  of Information Act'' (FOIA) and 32 CFR part 286.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information (to include documents) reviewed for declassification  within 2 years preceding the date of receipt of the MDR request. If this  is the case, the requester shall be provided the documents as previously  released and advised of the right to appeal to the DoD Component within  60 days unless the documents are already under appeal to the Interagency  Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information exempted from search and review by statute of 50  U.S.C. 431, 432, 432a, 432b, and 432d.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documents originated by the incumbent President; the incumbent  President's White House Staff; committees, commissions, or boards  appointed by the incumbent President; or other entities within the  Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the  incumbent President.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information marked as Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted  Data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Information that is the subject of pending litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> MDR Requester Guidelines. Members of the public seeking the  declassification of DoD documents under the provisions of section 3.5 of  Executive Order 13526, and 50 U.S.C. 431, 432, 432a, 432b, and 432d  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Address the written request to the appropriate DoD Component  listed in the appendix to this enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the requested document or information with sufficient  specificity to enable the DoD Component to locate it with a reasonable  amount of effort. Information that would provide the sufficient  specificity would include a document identifier such as originator,  date, title, subject, the National Archives and Records Administration  accession number, or other applicable unique document identifying  number. Broad or topical MDR requests for records on a particular  subject, such as ``any and all documents concerning'' a subject do not  meet this standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include a correct return mailing address with the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include a statement that the requester understands that the  request may incur processing charges in accordance with paragraph (k) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Receipt and Control. Upon receipt of an MDR request, the DoD  Component shall send the requester an acknowledgement and open a file in  a formal control system. The acknowledgement shall include the tracking  number and date of receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Simultaneous MDR and FOIA Requests. DoD Components should be  aware of possible requests under both the MDR and the FOIA. In  accordance with 32 CFR part 286, if a requester asks for the same  information under   the FOIA and the MDR, the DoD Component shall ask the requester to  select only one process. If the requester does not select a process, the  DoD Component shall process the requested information under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> MDR Document Review Process. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests normally will be  processed on a first in first out basis by date of receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Every effort shall be made to ensure that a response to an MDR  request is provided to the requester within 1 year from the date of  receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The DoD Components shall conduct line-by-line reviews of  documents responsive to an MDR request to determine if the information  contained within the documents continues to adhere to the standards for  classification according to Executive Order 13526 Classified National  Security Information. This line-by-line review must take into account  the unique sensitivity of FGI as outlined in paragraph (h) of this  section. In accordance with section 3.6(b) of Executive Order 13526  Classified National Security Information, classified information  originating with another U.S. Government agency contained in records of  the DoD Components will be referred to the originating agency for a  declassification and release determination. Likewise, classified  information in a DoD Component's records originating with another DoD  Component will be referred to the originating Component. It is the  responsibility of the DoD Component originally receiving the MDR request  to manage these referrals and to incorporate the other agency's or DoD  Component's determinations when preparing the final decision on the  request. The review of each document will determine if the document:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No longer meets the standards for classification as established  by Executive Order 13526 ``Classified National Security Information'',  and is therefore declassified in full.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contains portions still meeting the standards for  classification and is therefore declassified in part and denied in part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Still meets the standards for classification in its entirety  and is therefore denied in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For documents meeting the criteria of paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and  (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the DoD Components shall not release any  unclassified information exempt from public release pursuant to  Exemptions 2 through 9 of the FOIA. DoD 5400.7-R, ``DoD Freedom of  Information Act Program'' provides a more detailed explanation of the  FOIA exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When this process is complete, the DoD Components shall redact  all information, both classified and unclassified, determined to be  exempt from release as warranted under applicable law and authority. All  of the remaining information within the documents, which is determined  to be publicly releasable information, shall be provided promptly to the  requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Public Access. In the interest of transparency, the DoD  Components should make efforts to post documents released under the MDR  program on DoD Component Web sites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> FGI. Every effort must be made to ensure that FGI is not subject  to declassification without the prior consent of the originating  government. Therefore, if a requested document originated with a foreign  government or organization and was classified by that government or  organization, the DoD Component shall conduct MDR of the document in  accordance with DoD 5200.1-R and 32 CFR part 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Denial of Information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When classified information is  denied, the DoD Component shall advise the requester, in writing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That information currently and properly classified has been  denied (whether a document in its entirety or partially) in accordance  with the appropriate sections of Executive Order 13526 Classified  National Security Information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Of the right to appeal the denial to the DoD Component within  60 days of receipt of the denial.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Of the mailing address for the appellate authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When unclassified information is withheld because it is  determined to be exempt from release pursuant to Exemptions 2 through 9  of the FOIA (whether or not classified information   was also withheld within the same document), the DoD Component shall  advise the requester that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 3.5(c) of Executive Order 13526 Classified National  Security Information allows for the denial of information when  withholding it is authorized and warranted under applicable law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unclassified information exempt from public release pursuant to  one or more exemptions of the FOIA has been withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the denial of unclassified information, the requester shall  not be given MDR appeal rights because the MDR applies only to the  denial of classified information and because the request was not  processed under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The DoD Component is not required to confirm or deny the  existence or nonexistence of requested information whenever the fact of  its existence or nonexistence is itself classified pursuant to Executive  Order 13526 Classified National Security Information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> MDR Appeals. MDR appeals are for the denial of classified  information only. DoD Components shall make an appellate decision within  60 working days of receipt of an MDR appeal. If additional time is  required to make a determination, the appellate authority shall notify  the requester of the additional time needed and provide the requester  with the reason for the extension. When the appellate review is  complete, the appellate authority shall notify the requester in writing  of the final determination and of the reasons for any denial. If the  appellate authority determines that some information remains classified  under the provisions of Executive Order 13526 Classified National  Security Information, the requester will be advised of the right to  appeal the final decision to the ISCAP within 60 days of the final  Component decision, in accordance with section 5.3 of Executive Order  13526 Classified National Security Information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> FEES. In responding to MDR requests, the DoD Components may  charge fees as permitted by 32 CFR Part 2001. Fees for search, review,  and reproduction shall be in accordance with the fee schedule in  Appendix 2 of Chapter 4 of Volume 11A of DoD 7000.14-R (available at  http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/11a/11a_04.pdf).  [76 FR 80745, Dec. 27, 2011; 77 FR 745, Jan. 6, 2012]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 222--Addressing MDR Requests</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Department of Defense does not have a central  repository for DoD records. MDR requests therefore should be addressed  to the DoD Component that has custody of the requested record. If a  requester is not sure which DoD Component has custody or if the DoD  Component is not listed below, the MDR request should be directed to the  Washington Headquarters Services in paragraph (b)(1) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DoD Component MDR Addresses:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OSD and the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and the Joint Staff.
