                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority of the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the  Army, the Army General Counsel, as the Secretary's designee, or another  designee of the Secretary of the Army may approve settlements in excess  of $100,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delegations of Authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Denials and final offers made  under the delegations set forth herein are subject to appeal to the  authorities specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) and the Assistant Judge  Advocate General (TAJAG) are delegated authority to pay up to $100,000  in settlement of a claim and to disapprove a claim regardless of the  amount claimed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commander USARCS is delegated authority to pay up to $25,000  in settlement of a claim and to disapprove or make a final offer in a  claim regardless of the amount claimed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Judge Advocate (JA) or Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), subject  to limitations that USARCS may impose, and chiefs of a command claims  service are delegated authority to pay up to $25,000 in settlement,  regardless of the amount claimed, and to disapprove or make a final  offer in a claim presented in an amount not exceeding $25,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A head of an area claims office (ACO) is delegated authority to  pay up to $25,000 in settlement of a claim, regardless of the amount  claimed, and to disapprove or make a final offer in a claim presented in  an amount not exceeding $25,000. A head of a claims processing office  (CPO) with approval authority is delegated authority to approve, in full  or in part, claims presented for $5,000 or less, and to pay claims  regardless of the amount claimed, provided an award of $5,000 or less is  accepted in full satisfaction of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Authority to further delegate payment authority is set forth in  Sec. 536.3(g)(1) of this part. For further discussions also related to  approval, settlement and payment authority see also paragraph 2-69 of DA  Pam 27-162.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Settlement of multiple claims arising from a single incident.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a single act or incident gives rise to multiple claims  cognizable under this subpart, and where one or more of these claims  apparently cannot be settled within the monetary jurisdiction of the  authority initially acting on them, no final offer will be made. All  claims will   be forwarded, along with a recommended disposition, to the authority who  has monetary jurisdiction over the largest claim for a determination of  liability. However, where each individual claim, including derivative  claims, can be settled within the monetary authority initially acting on  them, and none are subject to denial, all such claims may be settled  even though the total amount exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the  approving or settlement authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If such authority determines that federal liability is  established, he or she may return claims of lesser value to the field  claims office for settlement within that office's jurisdiction. The  field claims office must take care to avoid compromising the higher  authority's discretion by conceding liability in claims of lesser  amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appeals. Denials or final offers on claims described as follows  may be appealed to the official designated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For claims presented in an amount over $100,000, final decisions  on appeals will be made by the Secretary of the Army or designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For claims presented for $100,000 or less, and any denied claim,  regardless of the amount claimed, in which the denial was based solely  upon an incident-to-service bar, exclusionary language in a federal  statute governing compensation of federal employees for job-related  injuries (see Sec. 536.44), or untimely filing, TJAG or TAJAG will  render final decisions on appeals, except that claims presented for  $25,000 or less, and not acted upon by the Commander USARCS, are  governed by paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For claims presented for $25,000 or less, final decisions on  appeals will be made by the Commander USARCS, his or her designee, or  the chief of a command claims service when such claims are acted on by  an ACO under such service's jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sections 536.64, 536.65, and 536.66 of this part set forth the  rules relating to the notification of appeal rights and processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delegated authority. Authority delegated by this section will  not be exercised unless the settlement or approval authority has been  assigned an office code.</p>
