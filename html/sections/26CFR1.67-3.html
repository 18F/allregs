[T.D. 8431, 57 FR 40321, Sept. 3, 1992]    Sec. 1.67-3T  Allocation of expenses by real estate mortgage  investment conduits (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allocation of allocable investment expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  real estate mortgage investment conduit or REMIC (as defined in section  860D) shall allocate to each of its pass-through interest holders that  holds an interest at any time during the calendar quarter the holder's  proportionate share (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section)  of the aggregate amount of allocable investment expenses of the REMIC  for the calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pass-through interest holder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) Meaning of  term. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the  term ``pass-through interest holder'' means any holder of a REMIC  residual interest (as definition in section 860G(a)(2)) that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual (other than a nonresident alien whose income with  respect to his or her interest in the REMIC is not effectively connected  with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person, including a trust or estate, that computes its taxable  income in the same manner as in the case of an individual, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this  section) if one or more of its partners, shareholders, beneficiaries,  participants, or other interest holders is (i) a pass-through entity or  (ii) a person described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) (1) or (2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(i) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X holds a residual interest in REMIC R in its  capacity as a nominee or custodian for individual A, the beneficial  owner of the interest. Because the owner of the interest for Federal  income tax purposes is an individual, the interest is owned by a pass- through interest holder.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Individual retirement account I holds a residual interest  in a REMIC. Because an individual retirement account is not a person  described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the interest is not  held by a pass-through interest holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Single-class REMIC--(A) In general. In the case of a single- class REMIC, the term ``pass-through interest holder'' means any holder  of either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em>, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Single-class REMIC. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of  this section, a single-class REMIC IS either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> but for its qualification as a REMIC under  section 860D and Sec. 1.860D-1T, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A REMIC that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is substantially similar to an investment trust under Sec.  301.7701-4(c)(1), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, in determining whether a  REMIC would be classified as an investment trust or is substantially  similar to an investment trust, all interests in the REMIC shall be  treated as ownership interests in the REMIC, without regard to whether  or not they would be classified as debt for Federal income tax purposes  in the absence of a REMIC election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section  must be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation M transfers mortgages to a bank under a trust  agreement as described in Example (2) of Sec. 301.7701-4(c)(2). There  are two classes of certificates. Holders of class C certificates are  entitled to receive 90 percent of the payment of principal and interest  on the mortgages; holders of class D certificates are entitled to  receive the remaining 10 percent. The two classes of certificates are  identical except that, in the event of a default on the underlying  mortgages, the payment rights of class D certificates holders are  subordinated to the rights of class C certificate holders. M sells the  class C certificates to investors and retains the class D certificates.  The trust would be classified as an investment trust under Sec.  301.7701-4(c)(1) but for its qualification a REMIC under section 860D  the class C certificates represent regular interests in the REMIC and  the class D certificates represent residual interest in the REMIC. The  REMIC is a single-class REMIC within the meaning of paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) of this section and, accordingly, holders of both the  class C and class D certificates who are described in paragraph  (a)(2)(i)(A) (1), (2), or (3) of this section are treated as pass- through interest holders.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that the facts are the same as in Example (1)  except that M structures the REMIC to include a second regular interest  represented by class E certificates. The principal purpose of M in  structuring the REMIC to include class E certificates is to avoid  allocating allocable investment expenses to class C certificate holders.  The class E certificate holders are entitled to receive the payments  otherwise due the class D certificate holders until they have been paid  a stated amount of principal plus interest. The fair market value of the  class E certificate is ten percent of the fair market value of the class  D certificate and, therefore, less than one percent of the fair market  value of the REMIC. The REMIC would not be classified as an investment  trust under Sec. 301.7701-4(c)(1) because the existence of the class E  certificates is not incidental to the trust's purpose of facilitating  direct investment in the assets of the trust. Nevertheless, because the  fair market value of the class E certificates is de minimis, the REMIC  is substantially similar to an investment trust under Sec. 301.7701- 4(c)(1). In addition, avoidance of the requirement to allocate allocable  investment expenses to regular interest holders is the principal purpose  of M in structuring the REMIC to include class E certificates.  Therefore, the REMIC is a single-class REMIC within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of this section, and, accordingly, holders of  both residual and regular interests who are described in paragraph  (a)(2)(i)(A) (1), (2), or (3) of this section are treated as pass- through interest holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pass-through entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of this section, a  pass-through entity is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A trust (or any portion thereof) to which Subpart E, Part 1,  Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code applies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A partnership,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An S corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A common trust fund described in section 584,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company (as defined  in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A REMIC, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Any other person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Which is not subject to income tax imposed by Subtitle A,  Chapter 1, or which is allowed a deduction in computing such tax for  distributions to owners or beneficiaries, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, such as qualified pension plans, individual retirement  accounts, and insurance companies holding assets in separate asset  accounts to fund variable contracts defined in section 817(d), are not  described in this paragraph (a)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. For purposes of this section, a pass-through entity  does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An estate,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A trust (or any portion thereof) not described in paragraph  (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> thereof, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A real estate investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocable investment expenses. The term ``allocable investment  expenses'' means the aggregate amount of the expenses paid or accrued in  the calendar quarter for which a deduction is allowable under section  212 in determining the taxable income of the REMIC for the calendar  quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. For purposes of this section, the term ``nonpublicly offered  regulated investment company'' means a regulated investment company to  which Part I of Subchapter M of the Code applies that is not a publicly  offered regulated investment company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Publicly offered regulated investment company. For purposes of  this section, the term ``publicly offered regulated investment company''  means a regulated investment company to which Part I of subchapter M of  the Code applies, the shares of which are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Continuously offered pursuant to a public offering (within the  meaning of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (15  U.S.C. 77a to 77aa)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Regularly traded on an established securities market, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Held by or for no fewer than 500 persons at all times during the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of allocable investment expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By pass-through  interest holders--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable year ending with calendar quarter. A pass- through interest holder whose taxable year is the calendar year or ends  with a calendar quarter shall be treated as having--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Received or accrued income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section  162 in the case of a pass-through interest holder that is a regulated  investment company), in an amount equal to the pass-through interest  holder's proportionate share of the allocable investment expenses of the  REMIC for those calendar quarters that fall within the holder's taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable year not ending with calendar quarter. A pass-through  interest holder whose taxable year does not end with a calendar quarter  shall be treated as having--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Received or accrued income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section  162 in the case of a pass-through interest holder that is a regulated  investment company), in an amount equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the  allocable investment expenses of the REMIC for those calendar quarters  that fall within the holder's taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For each calendar quarter that overlaps the beginning or end of  the taxable year, the sum of the daily   amounts of the allocable investment expenses allocated to the holder  pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for the days in the  quarter that fall within the holder's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proportionate share of allocable investment expenses. For  purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a pass-through interest  holder's proportionate share of the allocable investment expenses is the  amount allocated to the pass-through interest holder pursuant to  paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cross-reference. See Sec. 1.67-1T with respect to limitations  on deductions for expenses described in section 212 (including amounts  treated as such expenses under this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest income to holders of regular interests in certain  REMICs. Any amount allocated under this section to the holder of a  regular interest in a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) shall be treated as interest income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No adjustment to basis. The basis of any holder's interest in a  REMIC shall not be increased or decreased by the amount of the holder's  proportionate share of allocable investment expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Interest holders other than pass-through interest holders. An  interest holder of a REMIC that is not a pass-through interest holder  shall not take into account in computing its taxable income any amount  of income or expense with respect to its proportionate share of  allocable investment expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of proportionate share--(1) In general. For purposes  of paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section, a REMIC shall compute a pass- through interest holder's proportionate share of the REMIC's allocable  investment expenses by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining the daily amount of the allocable investment  expenses for the calendar quarter by dividing the total amount of such  expenses by the number of days in that calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocating the daily amount of the allocable investment  expenses to the pass-through interest holder in proportion to its  respective holdings on that day, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Totaling the interest holder's daily amounts of allocable  investment expenses for the calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other holders taken into account. For purposes of paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a pass-through interest holder's  proportionate share of the daily amount of the allocable investment  expenses is determined by taking into account all holders of residual  interests in the REMIC, whether or not pass-through interest holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Single-class REMIC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Daily allocation. In lieu of the  allocation specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a single- class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)  shall allocate the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses to  each pass-through interest holder in proportion to the amount of income  accruing to the holder with respect to its interest in the REMIC on that  day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other holders taken into account. For purposes of paragraph  (c)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of the allocable investment  expenses that is allocated on any day to each pass-through interest  holder shall be determined by multiplying the daily amount of allocable  investment expenses (determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section) by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of  income that accrues (but not less than zero) to the pass-through  interest holder on that day and the denominator of which is the total  amount of income (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this  section) that accrues to all regular and residual interest holders,  whether or not pass-through interest holders, on that day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Total income accruing. The total amount of income that accrues  to all regular and residual interest holders is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount includible under section 860B in the gross income  (but not less than zero) of the regular interest holders, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of REMIC taxable income (but not less than zero)  taken into account under section 860C by the residual interest holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dates of purchase and disposition. For purposes of this section,  a pass-through interest holder holds an interest on the date of its  purchase but not on the date of its disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1989,  REMIC X, which is not a single-class REMIC, incurs $900 of allocable  investment expenses. At the beginning of the calendar quarter, X has 4  residual interest holders, who hold equal proportionate shares, and 10  regular interest holders. The residual interest holders, all of whom  have calendar-year taxable years, are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A, an individual,</p><p class="depth0">C, a C corporation that is a nominee for individual I.</p><p class="depth0">S, an S corporation, and</p><p class="depth0">M, a C corporation that is not a nominee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except for A, all of the residual interest holders hold their  interests in X for the entire calendar quarter. On January 31, 1989, A  sells his interest to S. Thus, for the first month of the calendar  quarter, each residual interest holder holds a 25 percent interest  (100%/4 interest holders) in X. For the last two months, S's holding is  increased to 50 percent and A's holding is decreased to zero. The daily  amount of allocable investment expenses for the calendar quarter is $10  ($900/90 days).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of allocable investment expenses apportioned to the  residual interest holders is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $75 ($10 x 25% x 30 days) is allocated to A for the 30 days that  A holds an interest in X during the calendar quarter. A includes $75 in  gross income in calendar year 1989. The amount of A's expenses described  in section 212 is increased by $75 in calendar year 1989. A's deduction  under section 212 (including the $75 amount of the allocation) is  subject to the limitations contained in section 67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> $225 ($10 x 25% x 90 days) is allocated to C. Because C is a  nominee for I, C does not include $225 in gross income or increase its  deductible expenses by $225. Instead, I includes $225 in gross income in  calendar year 1989, her taxable year. The amount of I's expenses  described in section 212 is increased by $225. I's deduction under  section 212 (including the $225 amount of the allocation) is subject to  the limitations contained in section 67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> $375 (($10 x 25% x 30 days) + ($10 x 50% x 60 days)) is  allocated to S. S includes in gross income $375 of allocable investment  expenses in calendar year 1989. The amount of S's expenses described in  section 212 for that taxable year is increased by $375. S allocates the  $375 to its shareholders in accordance with the rules described in  sections 1366 and 1377 in calendar year 1989. Thus, each shareholder of  S includes its pro rata share of the $375 in gross income in its taxable  year in which or with which calendar year 1989 ends. The amount of each  shareholder's expenses described in section 212 is increased by the  amount of the shareholder's allocation for the shareholder's taxable  year in which or with which calendar year 1989 ends. The shareholder's  deduction under section 212 (including the allocation under this  section) is subject to the limitations contained in section 67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> No amount is allocated to M. However, M's interest is taken into  account for purposes of determining the proportionate share of those  residual interest holders to whom an allocation is required to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No allocation is made to the 10 regular interest holders  pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the interests  held by these interest holders are not taken into account for purposes  of determining the proportionate share of the residual interest holders  to whom an allocation is required to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allocable investment expenses not subject to backup withholding.  The amount of allocable investment expenses required to be allocated to  a pass-through interest holder pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this  section is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notice to pass-through interest holders--(1) Information  required.
