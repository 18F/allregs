The approval is required before the company implements the business line  or offers the product. In determining whether to approve the new  business line or product, senior management must consider whether the  liquidity risk of the new business line or product (under both current  and stressed conditions) is within the company's established liquidity  risk tolerance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Senior management must review at least annually significant  business lines and products to determine whether any line or product  creates or has created any unanticipated liquidity   risk, and to determine whether the liquidity risk of each strategy or  product is within the company's established liquidity risk tolerance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cash-flow projections. Senior management must review the cash- flow projections produced under paragraph (e) of this section at least  quarterly (or more often, if changes in market conditions or the  liquidity position, risk profile, or financial condition of the bank  holding company warrant) to ensure that the liquidity risk is within the  established liquidity risk tolerance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Liquidity risk limits.
