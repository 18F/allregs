The notification must identify the depository institution affiliate and the area(s) of noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Execution of agreement. Within 45 days after receiving a notice from the Board under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or such additional period of time as the Board may permit, the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State member bank must execute an agreement acceptable to the Board to comply with all applicable capital, management, asset and safeguard requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any relevant depository institution affiliate of the state member bank must execute an agreement acceptable to its appropriate Federal banking agency to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Agreement requirements.

If a state member bank does not continue to meet any applicable debt rating or alternative requirement of Sec. 208.71(b), the bank may not, directly or through a subsidiary, purchase or acquire any additional equity capital of any financial subsidiary until the bank restores its compliance with the requirements of that section. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term ``equity capital'' includes, in addition to any equity instrument, any debt instrument issued by the financial subsidiary if the debt instrument qualifies as capital of the subsidiary under any Federal or state law, regulation or interpretation applicable to the subsidiary.</p>
