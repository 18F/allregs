                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, evidence of the guaranty will be issuable to a lender of a  class described under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) if the loan is reported to the  Secretary not later than 60 days following full disbursement and upon  the certification of the lender that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No default exists thereunder that has continued for more than 30  days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in Sec.  36.4301, any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements  effected subsequent to the appraisal of reasonable value, and paid for  out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and  approved upon completion by a compliance inspector designated by the  Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the  plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based;  and any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been  approved as required in Sec. 36.4304 concerning guaranty or insurance  of loans to veterans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38  U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the regulations concerning guaranty or  insurance of loans to veterans.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loans made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3703(a), although not entitled  to automatic insurance thereunder, may, when made by a lender of a class  described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1), be reported for issuance of an  insurance credit.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), 3703(a)(2))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each loan proposed to be made to an eligible veteran by a lender  not within a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) shall be submitted to  the Secretary for approval prior to closing. Lenders described in 38  U.S.C. 3702(d) shall have the optional right to submit any loan for such  prior approval. The Secretary, upon determining any loan so submitted to  be eligible for a guaranty, or for insurance, will issue a certificate  of commitment with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the  issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance upon the ultimate  actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes  described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days  thereafter of a supplemental report showing that fact and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identity of any property purchased therewith,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That all property purchased or acquired with the proceeds of the  loan has been encumbered as required by the regulations concerning  guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in Sec.  36.4301(c), any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements paid  for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and  approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated  by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with  the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was  based; and that any deviations or changes of identity in said property  have been approved as required by Sec. 36.4304, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions  of 38   U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance  of loans to veterans.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate of  commitment shall have no further effect, or the amount of guaranty or  insurance shall be reduced pro rata, as may be appropriate under the  facts of the case: Provided, nevertheless, that if the loan otherwise  meets the requirements of this section, said certificate of commitment  may be given effect by the Secretary, notwithstanding the report is  received after the date otherwise required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For loans not reported within 60 days, evidence of guaranty will  be issued only if the loan report is accompanied by a statement signed  by a corporate officer of the lending institution which explains why the  loan was reported late. The statement must identify the case or cases in  issue and must set forth the specific reason or reasons why the loan was  not submitted on time. Upon receipt of such a statement evidence of  guaranty will be issued. A pattern of late reporting and the reasons  therefore will be considered by VA in taking action under Sec. 36.4353.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence of a guaranty will be issued by the Secretary by  appropriate endorsement on the note or other instrument evidencing the  obligation, or by a separate certificate at the option of the lender.  Notice of credit to an insurance account will be given to the lender.  Unused certificates of eligibility issued prior to March 1, 1946, are  void. No certificate of commitment shall be issued and no loan shall be  guaranteed or insured unless the lender, the veteran, and the loan are  shown to be eligible. Evidence of guaranty or insurance will not be  issued on any loan for the purchase or construction of residential  property unless the veteran, or the veteran's spouse in the case of a  veteran who cannot occupy the property because of active duty status  with the Armed Forces, certifies in such form as the Secretary shall  prescribe that the veteran, or spouse of the active duty veteran,  intends to occupy the property as his or her home. Guaranty or insurance  evidence will not be issued on any loan for the alteration, improvement,  or repair of any residential property or on a refinancing loan unless  the veteran, or spouse of an active duty servicemember, certifies that  he or she presently occupies the property as his or her home. An  exception to this is if the home improvement or refinancing loan is for  extensive changes to the property that will prevent the veteran or the  spouse of the active duty veteran from occupying the property while the  work is being completed. In such a case the veteran or spouse of the  active duty veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or  reoccupy the property as his or her home upon completion of the  substantial improvements or repairs. All of the mentioned certifications  must take place at the time of loan application and closing except in  the case of loans automatically guaranteed, in which case veterans or,  in the case of an active duty veteran, the veteran's spouse shall make  the required certification only at the time the loan is closed.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3704(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subject to compliance with the regulations concerning guaranty  or insurance of loans to veterans, the certificate of guaranty or the  evidence of insurance credit will be issuable within the available  entitlement of the veteran on the basis of the loan stated in the final  loan report or certification of loan disbursement, except for  refinancing loans for interest rate reductions. The available  entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the  date of receipt of an application for guaranty or insurance of a loan or  of a loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application  or loan report is date-stamped into VA. Eligibility derived from the  most recent period of service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier  period of service, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service  during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed,  or insured loan:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On property which the veteran owns at the time of application,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or  loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such  liability by the Secretary, the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to  the United States has been paid in full. Provided, that if the Secretary  issues or has issued a certificate of commitment covering the loan  described in the application for guaranty or insurance or in the loan  report, the amount and percentage of guaranty or the amount of the  insurance credit contemplated by the certificate of commitment shall not  be subject to reduction if the loan has been or is closed on a date that  is not later than the expiration date of the certificate of commitment,  notwithstanding that the Secretary in the meantime and prior to the  issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance shall have incurred  actual liability or loss on a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan  previously obtained by the borrower. For the purposes of this paragraph,  the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred actual loss on a  guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary has paid a guaranty or  insurance claim thereon and the veteran's resultant indebtedness to the  Government has not been paid in full, and to have incurred actual  liability on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary is in receipt  of a claim on the guaranty or insurance or is in receipt of a notice of  default. In the case of a direct loan, the Secretary will be deemed to  have incurred an actual loss if the loan is in default. A loan, the  proceeds of which are to be disbursed progressively or at intervals,  will be deemed to have been closed for the purposes of this paragraph if  the loan has been completed in all respects excepting the actual  ``payout'' of the entire loan proceeds.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(a), 3710(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Any amounts that are disbursed for an ineligible purpose shall  be excluded in computing the amount of guaranty or insurance credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Notwithstanding the lender has erroneously, but without intent  to misrepresent, made certification with respect to paragraph (a)(1) of  this section, the guaranty or insurance will become effective upon the  curing of such default and its continuing current for a period of not  less than 60 days thereafter. For the purpose of this paragraph a loan  will be deemed current so long as the installment is received within 30  days after its due date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> No guaranty or insurance commitment or evidence of guaranty or  insurance will be issuable in respect to any loan to finance a contract  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is for the purchase, construction, repair, alteration, or  improvement of a dwelling or farm residence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is dated on or after June 4, 1969;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides for a purchase price or cost to the veteran in excess  of the reasonable value established by the Secretary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Was signed by the veteran prior to the veteran's receipt of  notice of such reasonable value; unless such contract includes, or is  amended to include, a provision that reads substantially as follows:</p><p class="depth3">It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of  this contract, the purchaser shall not incur any penalty by forfeiture  of earnest money or otherwise be obligated to complete the purchase of  the property described herein, if the contract purchase price or cost  exceeds the reasonable value of the property established by the  Department of Veterans Affairs. The purchaser shall, however, have the  privilege and option of proceeding with the consummation of this  contract without regard to the amount of the reasonable value  established by the Department of Veterans Affairs.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 3703(c)(1))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> With respect to any loan for which a commitment was made on or  after March 1, 1988, the Secretary must be notified whenever the holder  receives knowledge of disposition of the residential property securing a  VA-guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the seller applies for prior approval of the assumption of  the loan, then:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A holder (or its authorized servicing agent) who is an automatic  lender must examine the creditworthiness of the purchaser and determine  compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714. The creditworthiness  review must be performed by the party that has automatic authority. If  both the holder and its servicing agent are automatic lenders, then they  must decide between   themselves which one will make the determination of creditworthiness,  whether the loan is current and whether there is a contractual  obligation to assume the loan, as required by 38 U.S.C. 3714. If the  actual loan holder does not have automatic authority and its servicing  agent is an automatic lender, then the servicing agent must make the  determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3714 on behalf of the holder. The  actual holder will remain ultimately responsible for any failure of its  servicing agent to comply with the applicable law and VA regulations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the assumption is approved and the transfer of the security  is completed, then the notice required by this paragraph (l) shall  consist of the credit package (unless previously provided in accordance  with paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section) and a copy of the executed  deed and/or assumption agreement as required by VA office of  jurisdiction. The notice shall be submitted to the Department with the  VA receipt for the funding fee provided for in Sec. 36.4313(e)(2).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the application for assumption is disapproved, the holder  shall notify the seller and the purchaser that the decision may be  appealed to the VA office of jurisdiction within 30 days. The holder  shall make available to that VA office all items used by the holder in  making the holder's decision in case the decision is appealed to VA. If  the application remains disapproved after 60 days (to allow time for  appeal to and review by VA), then the holder must refund $50 of any fee  previously collected under the provisions of Sec. 36.4313(d)(8). If the  application is subsequently approved and the sale is completed, then the  holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice  described in paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In performing the requirements of paragraphs (l)(1)(i)(A) or  (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the holder must complete its examination  of the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser and advise the  seller no later than 45 days after the date of receipt by the holder of  a complete application package for the approval of the assumption. The  45-day period may be extended by an interval not to exceed the time  caused by delays in processing of the application that are documented as  beyond the control of the holder, such as employers or depositories not  responding to requests for verifications, which were timely forwarded,  or follow-ups on those requests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If neither the holder nor its authorized servicing agent is an  automatic lender, the notice to VA shall include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Advice regarding whether the loan is current or in default;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A copy of the purchase contract; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A complete credit package developed by the holder which the  Secretary may use for determining the creditworthiness of the purchaser.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The notice and documents required by this section must be  submitted to the VA office of jurisdiction no later than 35 days after  the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for  the approval of the assumption, subject to the same extensions as  provided in paragraph (l)(l)(i) of this section. If the assumption is  not automatically approved by the holder or its authorized agent,  pursuant to the automatic authority provisions, $50 of any fee collected  in accordance with Sec. 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded. If the  Department of Veterans Affairs does not approve the assumption, the  holder will be notified and an additional $50 of any fee collected under  Sec. 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded following the expiration of the 30- day appeal period set out in paragraph (l)(l)(i)(B) of this section. If  such an appeal is made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, then the  review will be conducted at the Department of Veterans Affairs office of  jurisdiction by an individual who was not involved in the original  disapproval decision. If the application for assumption is approved and  the transfer of security is completed, then the holder (or its  authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice required in  paragraph (l)(l)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the seller fails to notify the holder before disposing of  property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary within  60 days after learning of the transfer. Such notice shall advise whether  or not the holder   intends to exercise its option to immediately accelerate the loan and  whether or not an opportunity will be extended to the transferor and  transferee to apply for retroactive approval of the assumption under the  terms of this paragraph (l).  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714)  (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection requirements in this section under control number 2900-0516)  [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008.
