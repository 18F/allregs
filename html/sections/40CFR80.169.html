(i) Presumptive Liability Affirmative Defense. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of Sec. 80.168, the detergent manufacturer shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Presumptive Liability Affirmative Defense. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of Sec. 80.168, the detergent manufacturer shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Product transfer documents which account for the detergent component of the product in violation and which indicate that such detergent satisfied all relevant requirements when it left the detergent manufacturer's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Written blending instructions which, pursuant to Sec. 80.161(c), were supplied by the detergent manufacturer to its customer who purchased or obtained from the manufacturer the detergent component of the product determined to be in violation. The written blending instructions must have been supplied by the manufacturer prior to the customer's use or sale of the detergent. The instructions must accurately specify both the appropriate LAC for the detergent, pursuant to Sec. 80.161(b)(1)(ii), plus any use restrictions which may pertain to this LAC pursuant to the detergent's certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced less than one year before the manufacturer was notified by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide FTIR test results for the batch in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The FTIR analysis may have been conducted on the subject detergent batch at the time it was manufactured, or may be conducted on a sample of that batch which the manufacturer retained for such purpose at the time the batch was manufactured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To establish that, when it left the manufacturer's control, the detergent component of the noncomplying product was in conformity with the chemical composition and concentration specifications reported pursuant to Sec. 80.161(b), the FTIR test results for the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product must be consistent with the FTIR results submitted at the time of registration pursuant to Sec. 80.162(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced more than one year prior to the manufacturer's notification by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> FTIR test results for the batch in question as specified in the preceding paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this Sec. 80.169(c); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following materials:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Documentation for the batch in question, showing that its measured viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, or any other such physical parameter(s) which EPA may have approved for monitoring production quality control, were within the acceptable range of production values specified in

the certification pursuant to Sec. 80.162(e); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the detergent registration identifies polymeric component(s) of the detergent package as the product(s) of other chemical reactants, documentation that the reagents used to synthesize the detergent batch in question were the same as those specified in the registration and that they met the manufacturer's normal acceptance criteria reported pursuant to Sec. 80.162(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Detergent manufacturer causation liability. In any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for a violation of Sec. 80.168, and the manufacturer establishes an affirmative defense to such liability pursuant to Sec. 80.169(c)(4)(i), the detergent manufacturer will nonetheless be deemed liable for the violation of Sec. 80.168 if EPA can demonstrate, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the detergent manufacturer caused the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Defense against liability where more than one party may be liable for VAR violations. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a violation of Sec. 80.170, except for the VAR record requirements pursuant to Sec. 80.170(g), such party shall not be deemed liable if it can establish the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the violation it had entered into a written contract with another potentially liable detergent blender party (``the assuming party''), under which that other party assumed legal responsibility for fulfilling the VAR requirement that had been violated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract included reasonable oversight provision to ensure that the assuming party fulfilled its VAR responsibilities (including, but not limited to, periodic review of VAR records) and the oversight provision was actually implemented by the party raising the defense;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The assuming party is fiscally sound and able to pay its penalty for the VAR violation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The employees or agents of the party raising the defense did not cause the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Defense to liability for gasoline non-conformity violations caused solely by the addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a gasoline non-conformity violation of Sec. 80.168(a) caused solely by another party's addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline, the former party shall not be deemed liable for the violation, provided that it can establish that it has fulfilled the defense requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Detergent tank transitioning defenses. The commingling of two detergents in the same detergent storage tank will not be deemed to violate or cause violations of any of the provisions of this subpart, provided the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The commingling must occur during a legitimate detergent transitioning event, i.e., a shift from the use of one detergent to another through the delivery of the new detergent into the same tank that contains the original detergent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any use restrictions applicable to the new detergent's certification also apply to the combined detergents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The commingling event must be documented, either on the VAR formula record or on attached supporting records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in Sec. 80.170, a VAR formula record must be created for the combined detergents. The VAR compliance period must begin no later than the time of the commingling event. However, at the blender's option, the compliance period may begin earlier, thus including use of the uncombined original detergent within the same period, provided that the 31-day limitation pursuant to Sec. 80.170(a)(6) is not exceeded; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The VAR formula record must also satisfy the requirements in one of the following paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) through (C) of this section, whichever applies to the commingling event. If neither paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) nor (B) of this section initially applies, then the blender may drain and subsequently redeliver the original detergent into the tank in restricted amounts, in order to meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, the blender

must comply with paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If both detergents have the same LAC, and the original detergent accounts for no more than 20 percent of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the two detergents have different LACs and the original detergent accounts for 10 percent or less of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent, and must attain the LAC of the new detergent. If the original detergent's LAC is greater than that of the new detergent, then the compliance period may begin earlier than the date of the commingling event (pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section) only if the original detergent does not exceed 10 percent of the total detergent used during the compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If neither of the preceding paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section applies, then the VAR formula record must identify both of the commingled detergents, and must use and attain the higher LAC of the two detergents. Once the commingled detergent has been depleted by an amount equal to the volume of the original detergent in the tank at the time the new detergent was added, subsequent VAR formula records must identify and use the LAC of only the new detergent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Transition from noncertified to certified detergent. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in Sec. Sec. 80.161(a)(3) and 80.168, after June 30, 1997, the addition to gasoline or PRC of a detergent which has not been certified pursuant to Sec. 80.161 shall not be deemed to violate or cause violations of provisions of this subpart, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The detergent was received by the detergent blender prior to July 1, 1997 and is used prior to January 1, 1998. Documentation which supports these dates must be maintained for at least five years and must be available for EPA's inspection upon request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The detergent is added to gasoline or PRC only in combination with a certified detergent and, at any one time, accounts for no more than 10 percent of the detergent tank's delivered volume;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The total volume of detergent added to the gasoline or PRC is sufficient to attain the LAC of the certified detergent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Use restrictions associated with the certified detergent are adhered to.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Procedures for curing use restrictions. In the case of a fuel product which has been additized with a detergent under the conditions of a use-restricted certification (pursuant to Sec. 80.163), the use restriction can be negated (``cured'') by application of the procedures in this paragraph (c)(9). A party shall not be liable for violations of Sec. 80.168(a) or (e) caused solely by the additization or subsequent use of gasoline or PRC in violation of such use restriction, provided that the following steps and conditions are applied before EPA has identified the nonconformity and prior to the sale or transfer of nonconforming product to the ultimate consumer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additional detergent must be added in sufficient quantity to provide effective deposit control, taking into account both the amount of detergent previously added and the final anticipated volume and composition of the subject fuel product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The additional detergent may be either the original detergent or a different detergent, so long as the additional detergent has been separately certified both for use with the subject fuel product and for use with the type of fuel product associated with the restriction which the party wishes to negate by the curing procedure. Detergents which have not been separately certified for both types of fuel products are not eligible to be used for this curing procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a fuel product has been detergent additized under the conditions of a use-restricted certification which would preclude the addition of an oxygenate or other PRC, then such oxygenate or other PRC may nevertheless be added to that fuel product under this curing procedure, provided that additional eligible detergent is added, in an amount which equals or exceeds

the number of gallons (DA) derived from the following equation:
Additional Detergent Volume = DA = Vp(LAC2 - LAC1) + V(1 - p)LAC2
where:
V = Final volume of fuel product (in gallons)p = Fraction of final fuel product composed of the original (uncombined)</p><p class="depth0">fuel productLAC2 = Detergent's LAC certified for the final combined fuel</p><p class="depth0">product (in gallons of detergent per 1,000 gallons of fuel</p><p class="depth0">product)LAC1 = Detergent's LAC certified for the original</p><p class="depth0"><em>(uncombined)</em> fuel product (in gallons of detergent per 1,000</p><p class="depth0">gallons of fuel product)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In other instances in which gasoline or PRC has been additized in violation of a detergent use restriction, and no additional fuel components are to be added, such use restriction can be cured by the addition of eligible detergent in an amount which equals or exceeds the number of gallons (DA) derived from the following equation, which is a simplified version of the previous equation:
Additional Detergent Volume = DA = V(LAC2 - LAC1)
