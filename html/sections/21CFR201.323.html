                                Sec. 201.323  Aluminum in large and small volume parenterals used
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The aluminum content of large volume parenteral (LVP) drug  products used in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy must not  exceed 25 micrograms per liter ([micro]g/L).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The package insert of LVP's used in TPN therapy must state that  the drug product contains no more than 25 [micro]g/L of aluminum. This  information must be contained in the ``Precautions'' section of the  labeling of all large volume parenterals used in TPN therapy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum  level of aluminum present at expiry must be stated on the immediate  container label of all small volume parenteral (SVP) drug products and  pharmacy bulk packages (PBPs) used in the preparation of TPN solutions.  The aluminum content must be stated as follows: ``Contains no more than  ---- [micro]g/L of aluminum.'' The immediate container label of all  SVP's and PBP's that are lyophilized powders used in the preparation of  TPN solutions must contain the following statement: ``When reconstituted  in accordance with the package insert instructions, the concentration of  aluminum will be no more than ---- [micro]g/L.'' This maximum level of  aluminum must be stated as the highest of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The highest level for the batches produced during the last 3  years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The highest level for the latest five batches, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maximum historical level, but only until completion of  production of the first five batches after July 26, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the maximum level of aluminum is 25 [micro]g/L or less,  instead of stating the exact amount of aluminum   as required in paragraph (c) of this section, the immediate container  label may state: ``Contains no more than 25 [micro]g/L of aluminum.'' If  the SVP or PBP is a lyophilized powder, the immediate container label  may state: ``When reconstituted in accordance with the package insert  instructions, the concentration of aluminum will be no more than 25  [micro]g/L''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The package insert for all LVP's, all SVP's, and PBP's used in  TPN must contain a warning statement. This warning must be contained in  the ``Warnings'' section of the labeling. The warning must state:</p><p class="depth2">WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum  may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if  kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk  because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of  calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p class="depth2">Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function,  including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum  at greater than 4 to 5 [micro]g/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels  associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading  may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicants and manufacturers must use validated assay methods to  determine the aluminum content in parenteral drug products. The assay  methods must comply with current good manufacturing practice  requirements. Applicants must submit to the Food and Drug Administration  validation of the method used and release data for several batches.  Manufacturers of parenteral drug products not subject to an approved  application must make assay methodology available to FDA during  inspections. Holders of pending applications must submit an amendment  under Sec. 314.60 or Sec. 314.96 of this chapter.
