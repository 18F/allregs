                            <p class="depth0">The Office of International Affairs (OIA) comprises international  antitrust, international consumer protection, and international  technical assistance. OIA is responsible for designing and implementing  the Commission's international program, which provides support and  advice to the Bureaus of Competition and Consumer Protection with regard  to the international aspects of investigation and prosecution of  unlawful conduct. OIA builds cooperative relationships between the  Commission and foreign authorities; works closely with Bureau personnel  to recommend agency priorities and policies and works, through bilateral  relationships and multilateral organizations, to promote those policies  internationally; and implements Commission policy and participation in  the competition and consumer protection aspects of trade fora and  negotiations, such as the U.S. inter-agency delegations negotiating  bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. OIA works with  authorized funding sources to develop and implement competition and  consumer protection technical assistance programs.  [72 FR 9434, Mar. 2, 2007]</p>
