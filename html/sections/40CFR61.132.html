                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each owner or operator of a furnace or a foundry coke  byproduct recovery plant shall enclose and seal all openings on each  process vessel, tar storage tank, and tar-intercepting sump.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall duct gases from each process vessel,  tar storage tank, and tar-intercepting sump to the gas collection  system, gas distribution system, or other enclosed point in the by- product recovery process where the benzene in the gas will be recovered  or destroyed. This control system shall be designed and operated for no  detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than  500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined by the  methods specified in Sec. 61.245(c). This system can be designed as a  closed, positive pressure, gas blanketing system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except, the owner or operator may elect to install, operate, and  maintain a pressure relief device, vacuum relief device, an access  hatch, and a sampling port on each process vessel, tar storage tank, and  tar-intercepting sump. Each access hatch and sampling port must be  equipped with a gasket and a cover, seal, or lid that must be kept in a  closed position at all times, unless in actual use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator may elect to leave open to the atmosphere  the portion of the liquid surface in each tar decanter necessary to  permit operation of a sludge conveyor. If the owner or operator elects  to maintain an opening on part of the liquid surface of the tar  decanter, the owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a  water leg seal on the tar decanter roof near the sludge discharge chute  to ensure enclosure of the major portion of liquid surface not necessary  for the operation of the sludge conveyor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Following the installation of any control equipment used to meet  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator  shall monitor the connections and seals on each control system to  determine if it is operating with no detectable emissions, using Method  21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) and procedures specified in  Sec. 61.245(c), and shall visually inspect each source (including  sealing materials) and the ductwork of the control system for evidence  of visible defects such as gaps or tears. This monitoring and inspection  shall be conducted on a semiannual basis and at any other time after the  control system is repressurized with blanketing gas following removal of  the cover or opening of the access hatch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an instrument reading indicates an organic chemical  concentration more than 500 ppm above a background concentration, as  measured by Method 21, a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If visible defects such as gaps in sealing materials are  observed during a visual inspection, a leak is detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as  practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A first attempt at repair of any leak or visible defect shall be  made no later than 5 calendar days after each leak is detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Following the installation of any control system used to meet  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator  shall conduct a maintenance inspection of the control system on an  annual basis for evidence of system abnormalities, such as blocked or  plugged lines, sticking valves, plugged condensate traps, and   other maintenance defects that could result in abnormal system  operation. The owner or operator shall make a first attempt at repair  within 5 days, with repair within 15 days of detection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of a furnace coke by-product recovery  plant also shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(c) of  this section for each benzene storage tank, BTX storage tank, light-oil  storage tank, and excess ammonia-liquor storage tank.
