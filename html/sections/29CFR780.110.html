                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">``Cultivation and tillage of the soil'' includes all the operations  necessary to prepare a suitable seedbed, eliminate weed growth, and  improve the physical condition of the soil. Thus, grading or leveling  land or removing rock or other matter to prepare the ground for a proper  seedbed or building terraces on farmland to check soil erosion are  included. The application of water, fertilizer, or limestone to farmland  is also included. (See in this connection Sec. Sec. 780.128 et seq.  Also see Farmers Reservoir Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755.) Other  operations such as the commercial production and distribution of  fertilizer are not included within the scope of agriculture. (McComb v.  Super-A Fertilizer Works, 165 F. 2d 824; Farmers Reservoir Co. v.  McComb, 337 U.S. 755.)</p><p class="depth0">Dairying    Sec. 780.111  ``Dairying'' as a farming operation.</p><p class="depth0">``Dairying'' includes the work of caring for and milking cows or  goats. It also includes putting the milk in containers, cooling it, and  storing it where   done on the farm. The handling of milk and cream at receiving stations  is not included. Such operations as separating cream from milk, bottling  milk and cream, or making butter and cheese may be considered as  ``dairying'' under some circumstances, or they may be considered  practices under the ``secondary'' meaning of the definition when  performed by a farmer or on a farm, if they are not performed on milk  produced by other farmers or produced on other farms. (See the  discussions in Sec. Sec. 780.128 et seq.)</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural or Horticultural Commodities</p>
