                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowance of deduction. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, any loss arising from theft is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. See section 165(c)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, any loss arising from theft is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. See section 165(c)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A loss arising from theft shall be treated under section 165(a) as sustained during the taxable year in which the taxpayer discovers the loss. See section 165(e). Thus, a theft loss is not deductible under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the theft actually occurs unless that is also the year in which the taxpayer discovers the loss. However, if in the year of discovery there exists a claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.165-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The same theft loss shall not be taken into account both in computing a tax under chapter 1, relating to the income tax, or chapter 2, relating to additional income taxes, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and in computing the income tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. See section 7852(c), relating to items not to be twice deducted from income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loss sustained by an estate. A theft loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit which is discovered during the settlement of an estate, even though the theft actually occurred during a taxable year of the decedent, shall be allowed as a deduction under sections 165(a) and 641(b) in computing the taxable income of the estate if the loss has not been allowed under section 2054 in computing the taxable estate of the decedent and if the statement has been filed in accordance with Sec. 1.642(g)-1. See section 165(c)(3). For purposes of determining the year of deduction, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount deductible. The amount deductible under this section in respect of a theft loss shall be determined consistently with the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.165-7 for determining the amount of casualty loss allowable as a deduction under section 165(a). In applying the provisions of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.165-7 for this purpose, the fair market value of the property immediately after the theft shall be considered to be zero. In the case of a loss sustained after December 31, 1963, in a taxable year ending after such date, in respect of property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes, the amount deductible shall be limited to that portion of the loss which is in excess of $100. For rules applicable in applying the $100 limitation, see paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.165-7. For other rules relating to the treatment of deductible theft losses, see Sec. 1.1231-1, relating to the involuntary conversion of property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section the term ``theft'' shall be deemed to include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, larceny, embezzlement, and robbery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application to inventories. This section does not apply to a theft loss reflected in the inventories of the taxpayer. For provisions relating to inventories, see section 471 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Example. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. In 1955 B, who makes her return on the basis of the calendar year, purchases for personal use a diamond brooch costing $4,000. On November 30, 1961, at which time it has a fair market value of $3,500, the brooch is stolen; but B does not discover the loss until January 1962. The brooch was fully insured against theft. A controversy develops with the insurance company over its liability in respect of the loss. However, in 1962, B has a reasonable prospect of recovery of the fair market value of the brooch from the insurance company. The controversy is settled in March 1963, at which time B receives $2,000 in insurance proceeds to cover the loss from theft. No deduction for the loss is allowable for 1961 or 1962; but the amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) for the taxable year 1963 is $1,500, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before theft....................    $3,500Less: Value of property immediately after the theft...........         0</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Balance.......................................................     3,500</p><p class="depth2">=========</p><p class="depth2">Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a):     $3,500</p><p class="depth2">($3,500 but not to exceed adjusted basis of $4,000 at time of</p><p class="depth2">theft).......................................................Less: Insurance received in 1963..............................     2,000</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Deduction allowable for 1963..................................     1,500</p><p class="depth2">[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6786, 29 FR 18502, Dec. 29, 1964]</p>
