The sanctuary nomination process (see  National Marine Sanctuaries Web site www.sanctuaries.noaa.gov) is the  means by which the public can submit areas of the marine and Great Lakes  environments for consideration by NOAA as a national marine sanctuary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> National significance criteria. The Director will consider the  following in determining if a nominated area is of special national  significance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The area's natural resources and ecological qualities are of  special significance and contribute to: Biological productivity or  diversity; maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem structure and  function; maintenance of ecologically or commercially important species  or species assemblages; maintenance or enhancement of critical habitat,  representative biogeographic assemblages, or both; or maintenance or  enhancement of connectivity to other ecologically significant resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The area contains submerged maritime heritage resources of  special historical, cultural, or archaeological significance, that:  Individually or collectively are consistent with the criteria of  eligibility or listing on the National Register of Historic Places; have  met or which would meet the criteria for designation as a National  Historic Landmark; or have special or sacred meaning to the indigenous  people of the region or nation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The area supports present and potential economic uses, such as:  Tourism; commercial and recreational fishing; subsistence and  traditional uses; diving; and other recreational uses that depend on  conservation and management of the area's resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The publicly-derived benefits of the area, such as aesthetic  value, public recreation, and access to places depend on conservation  and management of the area's resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Management considerations. The Director will consider the  following in determining the manageability of a nominated area:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The area provides or enhances opportunities for research in  marine science, including marine archaeology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The area provides or enhances opportunities for education,  including the understanding and appreciation of the marine and Great  Lakes environments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adverse impacts from current or future uses and activities  threaten the area's significance, values, qualities, and resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A national marine sanctuary would provide unique conservation  and management value for this area that also have beneficial values for  adjacent areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The existing regulatory and management authorities for the area  could be supplemented or complemented to meet the conservation and  management goals for the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There are commitments or possible commitments for partnerships  opportunities such as cost sharing, office space or exhibit space,  vessel time, or   other collaborations to aid conservation or management programs for the  area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> There is community-based support for the nomination expressed by  a broad range of interests, such as: Individuals or locally-based groups  (e.g., friends of group, chamber of commerce); local, tribal, state, or  national agencies; elected officials; or topic-based stakeholder groups,  at the local, regional or national level (e.g., a local chapter of an  environmental organization, a regionally-based fishing group, a  national-level recreation or tourism organization, academia or science- based group, or an industry association).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Following evaluation of a nomination against the national  significance criteria and management considerations, the Director may  place nominated areas in a publicly available inventory for future  consideration of designation as a national marine sanctuary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A determination that a site is eligible for national marine  sanctuary designation, by itself shall not subject the site to any  regulatory control under the Act. Such controls may only be imposed  after designation.</p>
