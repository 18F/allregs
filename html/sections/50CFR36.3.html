The collected information  will assist the Service in administering these programs and,  particularly, in the issuance of permits and the granting of statutory  or administrative benefits. The information requested in the application  form is required to obtain a benefit. The public reporting burden for   this collection of information is estimated to average 1.5 hours each  for 150 non-competitively awarded permits and 31.66 hours each for 60  competitively awarded permits including the time for reviewing  instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining  data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  The estimated annual number of respondents is 210, yielding a total  annual reporting and record keeping burden of 2125 hours. Comments and  suggestions on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the form  should be sent directly to the Service's Information Collection  Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).
