                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General Criteria for Requiring Tier 3 Testing. (1) Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from a fuel or fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by emissions from the fuel or additive products. Tier 3 testing may be conducted either on an individual basis or a group basis. If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from a fuel or fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by emissions from the fuel or additive products.

If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the criteria specific to particular tests as summarized and detailed in the testing guidelines (Sec. Sec. 79.62 through 79.68), EPA may consider a number of factors (including, but not limited to):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identification of concentration-effect relationships;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects would be likely to lead to incapacitating or irreversible conditions);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The type and number of species included in the reported tests;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The presence or absence of effective health test control data for base-fuel-only versus additive/base fuel mixture comparisons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The nature and amount of known toxic agents in the emissions stream; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important exposure route.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consideration of exposure. EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Types and emission rates of speciated emission components;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. (1) EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal as prescribed under Sec. 79.51(d). If EPA determines on the basis of the Tier 1 and 2 data submission and any other available information that further testing is necessary, EPA will require the responsible manufacturer(s) to conduct testing as described elsewhere in this section. EPA will notify the manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the purpose and nature of any proposed testing and of the proposed deadline for completing the testing. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA will provide the manufacturer a 60-day comment period after the manufacturer's receipt of such notice. EPA may extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the issues raised that further discussion is warranted. In the event that no comment is received by EPA from the manufacturer (or group) within the comment period, the manufacturer (or group) shall be deemed to have consented to the adoption by EPA of the proposed Tier 3 requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal as prescribed under Sec. 79.51(d).

manufacturer outlining the Tier 3 testing for that manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment. The public shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days after the publication of this notice to comment on the proposed Tier 3 testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed Tier 3 testing requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA will adopt final Tier 3 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. EPA will also issue a notice in the Federal Register announcing that it has adopted such final Tier 3 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements has been included in the public record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prior to beginning any required Tier 3 testing, the manufacturer shall submit detailed test protocols to EPA for approval. Once EPA has determined the Tier 3 testing requirements and approves the test protocols, any modification to the requirements shall be governed by Sec. 79.51(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Testing. (1) A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the In vivo Micronucleus Assay, required under Sec. 79.64, the In vivo Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under Sec. 79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under Sec. 79.68, or relevant pathologic findings under Sec. 79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Alternatively, Tier 3 carcinogenicity testing and/or mutagenicity testing may be required if there are positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of the tests required under Sec. Sec. 79.64, 79.65, and 79.68.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the In vivo Micronucleus Assay, required under Sec. 79.64, the In vivo Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under Sec. 79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under Sec. 79.68, or relevant pathologic findings under Sec. 79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared with appropriate controls.
