The Attorney General in turn may file a civil action in any United States District Court against any Federal employee who has knowingly solicited or accepted a gift from a foreign government in violation of the Act, or who has failed to deposit or report such gift, as an Act required by the Act. In such case, the court may assess a maximum penality of the retail value of a gift improperly solicited or received, plus $5,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supervisory officials at all levels within employing agencies shall be responsible for providing periodic reorientation of all employees under their supervision on the basic features of the Act and these regulations, and for ensuring that those employees observe the requirements for timely reporting and deposit of any gifts of more than minimal value they may have accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees are advised of the following actions which may result from failure to comply with the requirements of the Act and these regulations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any supervisor who has substantial reason to believe that an employee under his or her supervision has violated the reporting or other compliance provisions of the Act shall report the facts and circumstances in writing to the senior official in charge of administration within the cognizant bureau or office or at the post abroad. If that official upon investigation decides that an employee who is the donee of a gift or is the recipient of travel or travel expenses has, through actions within the employee's control, failed to comply with the procedures established by the Act and these regulations, the case shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases of confirmed evidence of a violation, whether or not such violation results in the taking of action by the Attorney General, the senior administrative official referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section as responsible for forwarding a violation report to the Attorney General shall institute appropriate disciplinary action against an employee who has failed to (i) Deposit tangible gifts within 60 days after acceptance, (ii) account properly for the acceptance of travel expenses or (iii) comply with the Act's requirements respecting disposal of gifts and decorations retained for official use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where there is confirmed evidence of a violation, but no evidence that the violation was willful on the part of the employee, the senior administrative official referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall institute appropriate disciplinary action of a lesser degree than that called for in

paragraph (c)(2) of this section in order to deter future violations by the same or another employee.</p>
