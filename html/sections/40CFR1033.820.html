We will specify a reasonable time and place at which you must supply the locomotives and a reasonable period during which we will keep them for testing.

The number of locomotives that you must supply is limited as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will not require a Class I railroad to supply more than five locomotives per railroad per calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will not require a non-Class I railroad (or other entity subject to the provisions of this subpart) to supply more than two locomotives per railroad per calendar year. We will request locomotives under this paragraph (a)(2) only for purposes that cannot be accomplished using locomotives supplied under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must make reasonable efforts to supply manufacturers/remanufacturers with the test locomotives needed to

fulfill the in-use testing requirements in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to fully comply with this section is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2).</p>
