                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for State plans. A State plan for OAA, AB, APTD,  and AABD shall specify if assistance payments shall be computed using a  prospective budgeting system or a retrospective budgeting system. A  State electing retrospective budgeting shall specify which options it  selects and the State plan shall state that it shall meet the  requirements in Sec. Sec. 233.21 through 233.29. Budgeting methods for  AFDC are described in Sec. Sec. 233.31 through 233.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to Sec. Sec.  233.21 through 233.29:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prospective budgeting means that the agency shall compute the  amount of assistance for a payment month based on its best estimate of  income and circumstances which will exist in that month. This estimate  shall be based on the agency's reasonable expectation and knowledge of  current, past or future circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retrospective budgeting means that the agency shall compute the  amount of assistance for a payment month based on actual income or  circumstances which existed in a previous month, the ``budget month''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Budget month means the fiscal or calendar month from which the  agency shall use income or circumstances of the family to compute the  amount of assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment month means the fiscal or calendar month for which an  agency shall pay assistance. Payment is based upon income or  circumstances in the budget month. In prospective budgeting, the budget  month and the payment month are the same. In retrospective budgeting,  the payment month follows the budget month and the payment month shall  begin within   32 days after the end of the budget month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Make an assistance payment. In the context of retrospective  budgeting, to make an assistance payment means that the check shall be  deposited in the U.S. mail, hand delivered to the recipient, or  deposited with an intermediary organization, such as a bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Supplemental payment. In the context of retrospective budgeting,  a supplemental payment is a payment which maintains a family during the  time it takes for the monthly assistance payment to reflect a change in  circumstances or income.
