                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equipment must be so designed that the main units can be  replaced readily, without elaborate recalibration or readjustment. Where  applicable, equipment must be constructed and installed so that it is  readily accessible for inspection and on-board maintenance purposes.  Adequate information must be provided to enable the equipment to be  properly operated and maintained (see IMO Resolution A.569(14)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Radio equipment required by this subpart must be maintained to  provide the availability of the functional requirements specified in  Sec. 80.1081 and to meet the performance standards specified in Sec.  80.1101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A1 and A2, the  availability must be ensured by duplication of equipment, shore-based  maintenance, or at-sea electronic maintenance capability, or a  combination of these.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A3 and A4, the  availability must be ensured by using a combination of at least two of  the following methods: duplication of equipment, shore-based  maintenance, or at-sea electronic maintenance capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Irrespective of the maintenance methods used, a ship must not  depart from any port unless and until the ship is capable of performing  all distress and safety functions as specified in Sec. 80.1081.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Irrespective of the maintenance methods used, all manufacturers'  instruction manuals and maintenance manuals for each piece of equipment  required and installed must be available on-board ship. Adequate tools,  spare parts, and test equipment appropriate to the methods used by the  ship as recommended by the manufacturer should be provided. The manuals,  tools, spare parts, and test equipment, as applicable, should be readily  accessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the duplication of equipment maintenance method is used, the  following radio installations, in addition to other equipment  requirements specified in this subpart, must be available on-board ships  for their sea areas as applicable. Equipment carried in accordance with  this paragraph must comply with Sec. Sec. 80.1101 and 80.1103.  Additionally, each radio installation must be connected to a separate  antenna and be installed and be ready for immediate operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. The MF radio installation installed for duplication must  also comply with the requirements Sec. 80.1089(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ships, equipped in accordance with Sec. 80.1091 for sea areas  A1, A2, and A3, must carry a VHF radio installation complying with the  requirements of Sec. 80.1085(a)(1) and either an MF/HF radio  installation complying with the requirements of Sec. 80.1091(b)(1) and  being able to fully comply with watch requirements as specified in Sec.  80.1123(a)(2) or an INMARSAT ship earth station complying with the  requirements of Sec. 80.1091(a)(1). The MF/HF radio installation or the  INMARSAT ship earth station installed for duplication must also comply  with the requirements Sec. 80.1091(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ships, equipped in accordance with Sec. 80.1093 for sea areas  A1, A2, A3, and A4, must carry a VHF radio installation complying with  the requirement of Sec. 80.1085(a)(1) and an MF/HF radio installation  complying with the requirements of Sec. 80.1091(b)(1) and being able to  fully comply with watch requirements as specified in Sec.  80.1123(a)(2). The MF/HF radio installation installed for duplication  must also comply with the requirements Sec. 80.1091(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The radio installations specified in paragraph (g) of this  section (referred as ``duplicated equipment''), in addition to the  appropriate radio equipment specified in Sec. 80.1099 (referred as  ``basic equipment''), must be connected to the reserve sources of energy  required by Sec. 80.1099. The capacity of the reserve sources of energy  should be sufficient to operate the particular installation (i.e., the  basic equipment or the duplicated equipment) with the highest power  consumption, for the appropriate period specified in Sec. 80.1099.  However, the arrangement for the reserve sources of energy must be such  that a single fault in this arrangement cannot affect both the basic and  the duplicated equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the shore-based maintenance method is used, the following  requirements apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance services must be completed and performance verified  and noted in the ship's record before departure from the first port of  call entered after any failure occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each GMDSS equipment must be tested and performance verified and  the results noted in the ship's record before departure from every port.  To accomplish this, each ship shall carry a performance checkoff sheet  listing each GMDSS equipment carried on a mandatory basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the at-sea maintenance method is used, the following  requirements apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequate additional technical documentation, tools, test  equipment, and spare parts must be carried on-board ship to enable a  qualified maintainer as specified in Sec. 80.1074 to perform tests and  localize and repair faults in the radio equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only persons that comply with the requirements of Sec. 80.1074  may perform at-sea maintenance on radio installations required by this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Satellite EPIRBs shall be tested at intervals not exceeding 12  months for all aspects of operational efficiency with particular  emphasis on frequency stability, signal strength and coding. The test  may be conducted on board the ship or at an approved testing or  servicing station.  [57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003]</p>
