For the purpose of such calculations, the surface area allowances set forth above shall not exceed more than 30 percent of the water surface area within the impoundment dam at maximum capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For all impoundments constructed on or after the effective date of the interim final regulation (the interim regulation was effective February 27, 1975; 40 FR 8513, February 27, 1975), the term ``within the impoundment,'' for purposes of calculating the volume of process wastewater which may be discharged, means the water surface area within the impoundment at maximum capacity.</p>
