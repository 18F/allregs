                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section establishes criteria, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 405(c), for grants to States to develop and implement effective programs that improve the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, uniformity, integration, and accessibility of State safety data needed to identify priorities for Federal, State, and local highway and traffic safety programs, evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, link State data systems, including traffic records and systems that contain medical, roadway, and economic data, improve the compatibility and interoperability of State data systems with national data systems and the data systems of other States, and enhance the agency's ability to observe and analyze national trends in crash occurrences, rates, outcomes, and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirement for traffic records coordinating committee (TRCC)--(1) Structure and composition. The State shall have a traffic records coordinating committee that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is chartered or legally mandated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meets at least three times annually;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has a multidisciplinary membership that includes owners, operators, collectors and users of traffic records and public health and injury control data systems, highway safety, highway infrastructure, law enforcement and adjudication officials, and public health, emergency medical services, injury control, driver licensing, and motor carrier agencies and organizations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Has a designated TRCC coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Functions.

The State shall have a Strategic Plan, approved by the TRCC, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Describes specific, quantifiable and measurable improvements anticipated in the State's core safety databases, including crash, citation or adjudication, driver, emergency medical services or injury surveillance system, roadway, and vehicle databases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any identified performance measure, uses the formats set forth in the Model Performance Measures for State Traffic Records Systems collaboratively developed by NHTSA and the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Includes a list of all recommendations from its most recent highway safety data and traffic records system assessment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identifies which such recommendations the State intends to implement and the performance measures to be used to demonstrate quantifiable and measurable progress; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For recommendations that the State does not intend to implement, provides an explanation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirement for quantitative improvement. A State shall demonstrate quantitative improvement in the data attributes of accuracy, completeness, timeliness, uniformity, accessibility

and integration in a core database by demonstrating an improved consistency within the State's record system or by achieving a higher level of compliance with a national model inventory of data elements, such as the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC), the Model Impaired Driving Records Information System (MIDRIS), the Model Inventory of Roadway Elements (MIRE) or the National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requirement for assessment. The State shall have conducted or updated, within the five years prior to the application due date, an in-depth, formal assessment of its highway safety data and traffic records system accurately performed by a group knowledgeable about highway safety data and traffic records systems that complies with the procedures and methodologies outlined in NHTSA's Traffic Records Highway Safety Program Advisory (DOT HS 811 644).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Requirement for maintenance of effort.
