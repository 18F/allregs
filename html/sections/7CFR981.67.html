                            <p class="depth0">Upon request of a handler, made prior to the delivery by him of any  reserve to the Board in any crop year, the Board shall authorize such  handler to act as agent of the Board, upon such reasonable terms and  conditions, including inspection and certification requirements, as the  Board may specify and subject to the conditions of Sec. 981.66 in  disposing of the reserve withheld from handling by such handler for that  crop year. Any handler who is authorized to dispose of his reserve may,   through arrangement with another handler dispose of such reserve through  such other handler or, in lieu of disposition, may acquire credits for  reserve disposition from another handler. In the first instance, the  second handler shall also be subject to the conditions of Sec. 981.66.  It shall be the obligation of any handler authorized to dispose of such  reserve to effect disposition thereof in accordance with all applicable  requirements and conditions. The proceeds of such disposition shall be  retained by the handler making the disposition, except that, in case he  disposes of the reserve of another handler, the proceeds from that  disposition shall be divided between the two handlers on the basis of a  mutual agreement. Such authorization shall expire as of December 31 of  the next crop year, and any reserve then remaining undisposed of by the  handler shall be returned to the Board. If the date of December 31  specified in Sec. 981.66(e) is extended, the date of December 31 shall  be extended correspondingly. Any handler who has been authorized to act  as agent of the Board in disposing of his reserve may terminate such  agency as of April 1 of the particular crop year by giving written  notice to the Board to that effect not later than the previous March 20,  in which event such handler shall return to the Board, for disposition  by it, all reserve almonds remaining in his possession. In case a  handler does not terminate his agency as of April 1, he shall be  required to continue to serve as such agent until December 31 of the  next crop year. The Board shall not terminate such an agency prior to  December 31 unless the agent violates the terms and conditions specified  by the Board or other provisions of the order. During the period of such  agency the Board, as principal, shall not dispose of the reserve  withheld from handling by said agent. The Board, with the approval of  the Secretary may prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary  to regulate disposition of reserve almonds including methods for  crediting as reserve any salable almonds sold and delivered to reserve  outlets.
