                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this part set forth policies, procedures, and  requirements for program implementation of GRP, as administered by the  Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service  Agency (FSA). The regulations in this part are administered under the  general supervision and direction of the NRCS Chief and the FSA  Administrator. These two agency leaders:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Concur in the establishment of program policy and direction,  development of the national allocation formula, and development of broad  national ranking criteria;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use a national allocation formula to provide GRP funds to NRCS  State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors that emphasizes  support for grazing operations, biodiversity of plants and animals, and  grasslands under the greatest threat of conversion to uses other than  grazing. The national allocation formula may also include additional  factors related to improving program implementation, as determined by  the NRCS Chief and the FSA Administrator. The allocation formula may be  modified periodically to change the emphasis of any factor(s) in order  to address a particular natural resource concern, such as the  precipitous decline of a population of a grassland-dependent bird(s) or  animal(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure the national, State, and local-level information  regarding program implementation is made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consult with USDA leaders at the State level and other Federal  agencies with the appropriate expertise and information when evaluating  program policies and direction; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Authorize NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive  Directors to determine how funds will be used and how the program will  be implemented at the State level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the State level, the NRCS State Conservationist and the FSA  State Executive Director are jointly responsible for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining how funds will be used and how the program will be  implemented at the State level to achieve the program purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identifying State priorities for project selection based on  input from the State Technical Committee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identifying Department of Agriculture (USDA) employees at the  field level responsible for implementing the program by considering the  nature and extent of natural resource concerns throughout the State and  the availability of human resources to assist with activities related to  program enrollment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Developing, with advice from the State Technical Committee,  program outreach materials at the State and local levels to help ensure  landowners, operators, and tenants of eligible land are aware and  informed that they may be eligible for the program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Approving conservation practices eligible for cost-share and  cost-share rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Developing GRP management plans and restoration agreements, when  applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Administering and enforcing the terms of easements and rental  contracts unless this responsibility is transferred to an eligible  entity as provided in Sec. 1415.17 and Sec. 1415.18; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Developing, with advice from the State Technical Committee,  criteria for ranking eligible land consistent with national criteria and  program objectives and State priorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit  Corporation (CCC) are available to NRCS and FSA to implement GRP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to funding availability, the program may be implemented  in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American  Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The NRCS Chief or the FSA Administrator may modify or waive a  provision of this part if he or she deems the application of that  provision to a particular limited situation to be inappropriate and  inconsistent with the conservation purposes and sound administration of  GRP. This authority cannot be further delegated. No provision of this  part, which is required by law, may be waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No delegation in this part to lower organizational levels will  preclude the NRCS Chief or the FSA Administrator from determining any  issue arising under this part or from reversing or modifying any  determination arising from this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The USDA Forest Service may hold GRP easements on properties  adjacent to USDA Forest Service land, with the consent of the landowner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Program participation is voluntary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Applications for participation will be accepted on a continual  basis at local USDA Service Centers. Eligible entities wishing to enter  into a cooperative agreement under Sec. 1415.17 in order   to purchase, own, write, and hold easements may apply on a continuous  basis to the NRCS State Conservationist. The NRCS State Conservationist  and FSA State Executive Director will establish cut-off periods to rank  and select applications for participation. These cut-off periods will be  available in program outreach material provided by the local USDA  Service Center. Once funding levels have been exhausted, unfunded  eligible applications will remain on file until they are funded or the  applicant chooses to be removed from consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The services of third parties as provided for in part 652 of  this title may be used to provide technical services to participants.</p>
