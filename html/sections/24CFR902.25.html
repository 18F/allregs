Under the physical condition indicator, a score will be calculated for individual projects, as well as for the overall condition of a PHA's public housing portfolio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overall PHA physical condition indicator score. The overall physical condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores.

(1) The project or projects' 100-point physical condition score is converted to a 40-point basis for the overall physical condition indicator score. The project scores on the 100-point basis are multiplied by .40 in order to derive a 40-point equivalent score to compute the overall physical condition score and overall PHAS score.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project or projects' 100-point physical condition score is converted to a 40-point basis for the overall physical condition indicator score.
