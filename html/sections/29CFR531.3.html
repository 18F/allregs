                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the Act is  hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost to the employer of  the board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by him to  his employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the employer or to  any affiliated person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except whenever any determination made under Sec. 531.4 is  applicable, the ``reasonable cost'' to the employer of furnishing the  employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including housing) is  the cost of operation and maintenance including adequate depreciation  plus a reasonable allowance (not more than 5\1/2\ percent) for interest  on the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer: Provided,  That if the total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the  fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the fair  rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or facilities offered  for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. The cost of operation and  maintenance, the rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of  capital invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good  accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term ``good  accounting practices'' does not include accounting practices which have  been rejected by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes, and the  term ``depreciation'' includes obsolescence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of furnishing ``facilities'' found by the  Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience of the  employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may not therefore be  included in computing wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following is a list of facilities found by the Administrator  to be primarily for the benefit of convenience of the employer. The list  is intended to be illustrative rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the  trade and other materials and services incidental to carrying on the  employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and for the  employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their laundering, where the  nature of the business requires the employee to wear a uniform.</p>
