                            <p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> any individual in the service of one  or more employers for compensation, (2) any individual who is in the  employment relation to one or more employers, and (3) an employee  representative. The term ``employee'' shall include an employee of a  local lodge or division defined as an employer in sub-section (a) only  if he was in the service of or in the employment relation to a carrier  on or after the enactment date. The term ``employee representative''  means any officer or official representative of a railway labor  organization other than a labor organization included in the term  ``employer'' as defined in section 1(a) who before or after the  enactment date was in the service of an employer as defined in section  1(a) and who is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in  accordance with the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and any individual  who is regularly assigned to or regularly employed by such officer or  official representative in connection with the duties of his office.</p><p class="depth2">The term ``employee'' shall not include any individual while such  individual is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the  mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than  movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal   not beyond the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.</p><p class="depth2">An individual is in the service of an employer whether his service  is rendered within or without the United States if (i) he is subject to  the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the  manner of rendition of his service, or he is rendering professional or  technical services and is integrated into the staff of the employer, or  he is rendering, on the property used in the employer's operations,  other personal services the rendition of which is integrated into the  employer's operations, and (ii) he renders such service for  compensation, or a method of computing the monthly compensation for such  service is provided in section 3(c): Provided, however, That an  individual shall be deemed to be in the service of an employer, other  than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway- labor-organization employer, not conducting the principal part of its  business in the United States only when he is rendering service to it in  the United States; and an individual shall be deemed to be in the  service of such a local lodge or division only if (1) all, or  substantially all, the individuals constituting its membership are  employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business  in the United States; or (2) the headquarters of such local lodge or  division is located in the United States; and an individual shall be  deemed to be in the service of such a general committee only if (1) he  is representing a local lodge or division described in clauses (1) or  (2) immediately above; or (2) all, or substantially all, the individuals  represented by it are employees of an employer conducting the principal  part of its business in the United States; or (3) he acts in the  capacity of a general chairman or an assistant general chairman of a  general committee which represents individuals rendering service in the  United States to an employer, but in such case if his office or  headquarters is not located in the United States and the individuals  represented by such general committee are employees of an employer not  conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, only  such proportion of the remuneration for such service shall be regarded  as compensation as the proportion which the mileage in the United States  under the jurisdiction of such general committee bears to the total  mileage under its jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is  inapplicable in which case the Board may prescribe such other formula as  it finds to be equitable, and if the application of such mileage  formula, or such other formula as the Board may prescribe, would result  in the compensation of the individual being less than 10 per centum of  his remuneration for such service no part of such remuneration shall be  regarded as compensation: Provided further, That an individual not a  citizen or resident of the United States shall not be deemed to be in  the service of an employer when rendering service outside the United  States to an employer who is required under the laws applicable in the  place where the service is rendered to employ therein, in whole or in  part, citizens or residents thereof; and the laws applicable on August  29, 1935, in the place where the service is rendered shall be deemed to  have been applicable there at all times prior to that date.</p>
