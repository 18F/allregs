                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding the technical criteria in this subpart, Subpart E of this part, and Subpart G of part 74 of this chapter regarding interference protection to and from Class A TV stations, Class A TV stations may negotiate agreements with parties of authorized and proposed analog TV, DTV, LPTV, TV translator, Class A TV stations or other affected parties to resolve interference concerns; provided, however, other relevant requirements are met with respect to the parties to the agreement. A written and signed agreement must be submitted with each application or other request for action by the Commission. Negotiated agreements under this paragraph can include the exchange of money or other considerations from one entity to another. Applications submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph will be granted only if the Commission finds that such action is consistent with the public interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Class A TV station displaced in channel by a channel allotment change for a DTV station may seek to exchange channels with the DTV station, provided both parties consent in writing to the change and that the Class A station meets all applicable interference protection requirements on the new channel. Such requests will be treated on a case-by-case basis and, if approved, will not subject the Class A station to the filing of competing applications for the exchanged channel.</p>
