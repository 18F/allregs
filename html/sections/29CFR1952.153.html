                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the terms of the 1978 Court Order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall,  compliance staffing levels (``benchmarks'') necessary for a ``fully  effective'' enforcement program were required for each State operating  an approved State plan. In September 1984, North Carolina, in  conjunction with OSHA, completed a reassessment of the levels initially  established in 1980 and proposed revised benchmarks of 50 safety and 27  health compliance officers. After opportunity for public comment and  service on the AFL-CIO, the Assistant Secretary approved these revised  staffing requirements on January 17, 1986. In June 1990, North Carolina  reconsidered the information utilized in the initial revision of its  1980 benchmarks and determined that changes in local conditions and  improved inspection data warranted further revision of its benchmarks to  64 safety inspectors and 50 industrial hygienists. After opportunity for  public comment and service on the AFL-CIO, the Assistant Secretary  approved these revised staffing requirements on June 4, 1996.  [61 FR 28055, June 4, 1996]</p>
