Such an order will normally be issued on recommendation from OIG and in consultation with the Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight or Division of Grants and Agreements, the Office of the General Counsel, the responsible Directorate, and other parts of the Foundation as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When suspension is determined to be appropriate, the case will be referred to the suspending official pursuant to 2 CFR part 180, and the suspension procedures of 2 CFR part 180 will be followed, but the suspending official will be either the Deputy Director or an official designated by the Deputy Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Such interim actions may be taken whenever information developed during an investigation indicates a need to do so. Any interim action will be reviewed periodically during an investigation by NSF and modified as warranted. An interested party may request a review or modification by the Deputy Director of any interim action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Deputy Director will make and OIG will retain a record of interim actions taken and the reasons for taking them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interim administrative actions are not final agency actions subject to appeal.
