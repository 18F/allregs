                            <p class="depth0">After a motion for reconsideration has been allowed, a hearing will  be granted if an appellant requests a hearing before the Board. The  hearing will be held by a Member or Members assigned to the  reconsideration panel. A hearing will not normally be scheduled solely  for the purpose of receiving argument by a representative. Such argument  should be submitted in the form of a written brief. Oral argument may  also be submitted on audio cassette for transcription for the record in  accordance with Rule 700(d) (Sec. 20.700(d) of this part). Requests for  appearances by representatives alone to personally present argument to a  Member or panel of Members of the Board may be granted if good cause is  shown. Whether good cause has been shown will be determined by the  presiding Member.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7102, 7103, 7105(a))  [61 FR 20453, May 7, 1996]    Sec. Sec. 20.1004-20.1099  [Reserved]</p>
