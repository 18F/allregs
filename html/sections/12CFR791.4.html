                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Board meetings--(1) Applicability of the Sunshine Act. The Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b, ``Sunshine Act'') requires that joint deliberations of the Board be held in accordance with its open meetings provisions (5 U.S.C. 552b (b) through (f)). (Subpart C of this part contains NCUA's regulations implementing the Sunshine Act.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Presiding officer. The Chairman is the presiding officer, and in the Chairman's absence, the designated Vice Chairman shall preside. The presiding officer shall make procedural rulings. Any Board member may appeal a ruling made by the presiding officer. The appeal of a procedural ruling by the presiding officer shall be immediately considered by the Board, and a majority decision by the Board shall decide the procedural ruling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notation voting. Notation voting is the circulation of written memoranda and voting sheets to the office of each Board member simultaneously and the tabulation of responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Matters that may be decided by notation voting. Notation voting may be used only for administrative or time sensitive matters, for example, enforcement or interagency actions requiring prompt Board action matters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notation vote sheets. Notation vote sheets will be used to record the vote tally on a notation vote. The Secretary of the Board has administrative responsibility over notation voting, including the authority to establish deadlines for voting, receive notation vote sheets, count votes, and determine whether further action is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Veto of notation voting. In view of public policy for openness reflected in the Sunshine Act, each Board member is authorized to veto the use of notation voting for the consideration of any particular matter, and thus requires that the matter be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled Board meeting that is held at least ten days after the date of the veto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure of result. A record is to be maintained of Board transactions by use of the notation voting procedure. Public disclosure of this record is determined by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
