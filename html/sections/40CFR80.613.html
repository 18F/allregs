This  initial notification to a refiner shall include specific information  concerning the name and address of the retail outlet, contact  information, the brand, and the sulfur content of the sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of any test result that is three or more ppm greater  than the   15 ppm standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under  Sec. 80.580(d), or for a test result that is one or two ppm greater than  the 15 ppm standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under  Sec. 80.580(d), and the retail outlet has had an exceedance within the  previous two years, the independent survey association shall, within the  time limits specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section,  provide notice to the parties described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of  this section. The notice to EPA must include the name and address of the  retail outlet, and the telephone number, if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The independent survey association shall provide notice to the  identified contact person or persons for each party specified in  paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section in writing (e.g. e-mail  or facsimile) and, if requested by the identified contact person, by  telephone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide to EPA quarterly and annual summary survey reports which  include the information specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Maintain all records relating to the surveys conducted under  this paragraph (e) for a period of at least 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> At any time permit any representative of EPA to monitor the  conduct of the surveys, including sample collection, transportation,  storage, and analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Survey plan design requirements. The proposed survey plan  required under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall, at a minimum,  include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Number of surveys. The survey plan shall include four surveys  each calendar year. The four surveys collectively are called the survey  series.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sampling areas. The survey plan shall include sampling in three  types of areas, called sampling strata, during each survey: Densely  populated areas, transportation corridors and rural areas. These  sampling strata shall be further divided into discrete sampling areas,  or clusters. Each survey shall include sampling in at least 40 sampling  areas in each stratum, randomly selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No advance notice of surveys. The survey plan shall include  procedures to keep confidential from any regulated party, but not from  EPA, the identification of the sampling areas that are included in any  survey plan prior to the beginning of a survey in an area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Retail outlet selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The retail outlets to be sampled in a sampling area shall be  selected from among all retail outlets in the sampling area that sell  motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1), with probability of selection proportionate to the  volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur  standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1) sold at the retail outlets, and  inclusion of retail outlets with different brand names and unbranded, if  possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of any retail outlet from which a sample of motor  vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1) was collected during a survey and determined to have a  sulfur content that exceeds the 15 ppm sulfur standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under Sec. 80.580(d), that retail outlet  shall be included in the subsequent survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Only a single sample shall be collected at each retail outlet,  except that where a retail outlet had a sample from the preceding survey  with a test result that exceeds the 15 ppm standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under Sec. 80.580(d), separate samples  shall be taken that represent the diesel fuel contained in each storage  tank containing motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur  standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), unless collection of separate samples  is not practicable (for example, due to diesel piping arrangements or  pump outages).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Number of samples. (A) The minimum number of samples to be  included in the survey plan for each calendar year shall be calculated  as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY10.288  Where:  n = minimum number of samples in a year-long survey series. However, in</p><p class="depth0">no case shall n be larger than 9,600 or smaller than 1,800. Z[alpha] = upper percentile point from the normal distribution to</p><p class="depth0">achieve a one-tailed 95% confidence level (5% [alpha]-level).</p><p class="depth0">Thus, Z[alpha] equals 1.645. Z[beta] = upper percentile point to achieve 95% power. Thus, Z[beta]</p><p class="depth0">equals 1.645. [phis]l = the maximum proportion of stations selling non-</p><p class="depth0">compliant fuel for the fuel in a region to be deemed</p><p class="depth0">compliant. In this test, the parameter needs to be 5% or</p><p class="depth0">greater, i.e., 5% or more of the stations, within a stratum</p><p class="depth0">such that the region is considered non-compliant. For this</p><p class="depth0">survey, [phis]l will be 5%. [phis]o = the underlying proportion of non-compliant stations in a</p><p class="depth0">sample. For calendar year 2011, [phis]owill be 1.9%. For</p><p class="depth0">calendar years 2012 and beyond, [phis]o will be the average of</p><p class="depth0">the proportion of stations to be non-compliant over the</p><p class="depth0">previous four surveys. Stn = number of sampling strata. For purposes of this survey</p><p class="depth0">program, Stn equals 3. Fa = adjustment factor for the number of extra samples</p><p class="depth0">required to compensate for collected samples that cannot be</p><p class="depth0">included in the survey, based on the number of additional</p><p class="depth0">samples required during the previous four surveys. However, in</p><p class="depth0">no case shall the value of Fa be smaller than 1.1.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this adjustment factor, a sample shall be</p><p class="depth0">treated as one that can be included in the survey only if the</p><p class="depth0">fuel was offered for sale as motor vehicle diesel fuel subject</p><p class="depth0">to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1) at the</p><p class="depth0">retail outlet where the sample was collected and if an</p><p class="depth0">appropriate laboratory analysis of this fuel is conducted. Fb = adjustment factor for the number of samples required to</p><p class="depth0">resample each retail outlet with test results greater than 17</p><p class="depth0">ppm (resampling), based on the rate of resampling required</p><p class="depth0">during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall</p><p class="depth0">the value of Fb be smaller than 1.1. Sun = number of surveys per year. For purposes of this survey</p><p class="depth0">program, Sun equals 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The number of samples obtained from the formula in paragraph  (e)(4)(v)(A) of this section, after being incremented as necessary to  allocate whole numbers of samples to each cluster, shall be distributed  approximately equally for the surveys conducted during the calendar  year. Within a survey, the samples shall be divided approximately  equally for the three strata.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sulfur test result that is one or two ppm Greater than the 15  ppm standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under Sec. 80.580(d).  The following provisions apply if the tested sulfur level of a diesel  fuel sample collected by the independent survey association is one or  two ppm greater than the 15 ppm standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), as  adjusted under Sec. 80.580(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Branded refiner or importer. Where the sample was collected at a  retail outlet at which the brand name of a refiner or importer is  displayed, the branded refiner or importer will be deemed to have  established its defense under this section, provided that the refiner or  importer participates in a consortium as described in paragraph (e)(1)  of this section, and provided that the refiner or importer also  demonstrates the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The sulfur content of the diesel fuel at the terminal(s) that  most recently supplied the retail outlet was no greater than 15 ppm  prior to adjustment under Sec. 80.580(d) when dispensed for delivery to  the retail outlet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Best efforts and accepted business practices are used by parties  downstream from the refiner or importer to avoid diesel fuel  contamination. These would include, for example, procedures for ensuring  motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1) is not contaminated in delivery trucks, and procedures  for ensuring delivery truck drivers can identify retail outlet drop  points for motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur  standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> must be taken as soon as practicable after  receiving the notification required under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of  this section, which normally will be within the same business day, but  no longer than twenty-four hours after notification is received unless  the refiner or importer demonstrates this timing is not possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A root cause analysis is performed to determine the cause of the  noncompliant diesel fuel and appropriate actions are taken to prevent  future violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The independent survey association samples and retests the  diesel fuel at the retail outlet during its next survey, in addition to  the scheduled sampling and testing under the approved survey program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The refiner or importer submits a report to EPA no later than  120 days following the date the sample was collected at the retail  outlet, which includes the information specified in paragraph (e)(7) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The refiner or importer supplies EPA with copies of the  contracts with downstream parties specified in Sec. 80.613(b)(2) or the  specifications or inspections of procedures and equipment described in  Sec. 80.613(b)(3), as appropriate, which are designed to prevent the  contamination of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur  standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unbranded refiner or importer.
