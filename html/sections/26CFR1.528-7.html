                            <p class="depth0">An organization is not a homeowners association if any part of its net earnings inures (other than as a direct result of its engaging in one or more exempt functions) to the benefit of any private person. Thus, to the extent that members receive a benefit from the general maintenance, etc., of association property, this benefit generally would not constitute inurement. If an organization pays rebates from amounts other than exempt function income, such rebates will constitute inurement. In general, in determining whether an organization is in violation of this section, the principles used in making similar determinations under Section 501(c) will be applied.
