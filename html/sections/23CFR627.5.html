project by splitting the project into smaller projects, or programming multiple design or construction projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The STA's VE Program's policies and procedures should identify when VE analyses are to be considered or conducted for projects falling below the required thresholds identified in paragraph (b) of this section in the planning and development of transportation projects where there is a high potential for the project to benefit from a VE analysis.
