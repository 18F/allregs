                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manner of nominating grower members and alternate members to  the committee shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The committee's mailing of an approved nomination form to all  kiwifruit growers of record shall constitute notice of nominations. All  eligible kiwifruit growers may nominate themselves or any other eligible  kiwifruit grower to vacant committee positions for the nominee's  district. Completed nomination forms shall be returned to the office of  the committee by a date specified by the committee and approved by an  agent of the Secretary. Nomination forms shall provide for names of  nominees, as well as the nominating grower's name, address, telephone  number, and signature. Incomplete nominations forms will not be  considered valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each district involved in the current year's nominations,  committee staff, with the Secretary's oversight, shall establish a slate  of candidates with the names of all qualified nominees received. Persons  submitting invalid nomination forms shall be notified of such by the  committee. Within a reasonable time period, a ballot containing a slate  of candidates shall be mailed to all growers of record within the  respective district represented by such candidates. The committee shall  provide a reasonable period of time to growers to cast votes on the  candidates and return the completed ballots for tallying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To be eligible to vote, growers must be producing kiwifruit  during the crop year nominations are held and within the district  represented by the candidates on the ballot. A grower may only vote for  candidates from one district and may only cast one ballot. Growers may  also cast votes for eligible candidates who do not appear on the ballots  by writing in the name of such candidates on the ballot. Each ballot  shall provide for a voter eligibility certification which must include  the voter's name, address, telephone number, and signature, as well as  the name(s) of all handlers which handled the current season's crop. At  the discretion of the Secretary, the ballots may include other  background information about each candidate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In order to be valid, ballots must be executed in accordance  with the instructions set forth on the ballot, and are to be returned to  the Secretary's agent who will tally the ballots with such assistance  from the committee as may be requested by the agent. Such ballots shall  be postmarked by a date specified by the committee and approved by an  agent of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The names of the persons receiving the highest total number of  votes for a particular position shall be submitted to the Secretary as  the nominees for such positions. In the event of a tie vote, a ballot  containing only the names of the candidates receiving the tied vote  shall be mailed to all growers in the affected district.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of a vacancy as specified in Sec. 920.26, the  committee shall utilize the same procedure as prescribed in Sec.  920.122(a)(1) through (a)(5) to fill such vacancy.
