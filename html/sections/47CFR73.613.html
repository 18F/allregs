                                Sec.  73.613  Protection of Class A TV stations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An application for a new TV broadcast station or for changes in  the operating facilities of an existing TV broadcast station will not be  accepted for filing if it fails to comply with the requirements  specified in this section.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec.  73.613(a): Licensees and permittees of TV broadcast  stations that were authorized on November 29, 1999 (and applicants for  new TV stations that had been cut-off without competing applications or  that were the winning bidder in a TV broadcast station auction as of  that date, or that were the proposed remaining applicant in a group of  mutually exclusive applications for which a settlement agreement was on  file as of that date) may continue to operate with facilities that do  not protect Class A TV stations. Applications filed on or before  November 29, 1999 for a change in the operating facilities of such  stations also are not required to protect Class A TV stations under the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due to the frequency spacing which exists between TV channels 4  and 5, between channels 6 and 7, and between channels 13 and 14, first- adjacent channel protection standards shall not be applicable to these  pairs of channels. Some interference protection requirements of this  section only apply to stations transmitting on the UHF TV channels 14  through 51 (See Sec.  73.603(a) of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A UHF TV broadcast station application will not be accepted if  it specifies a site less than 100 kilometers from the transmitter site  of a UHF Class A TV station operating on a channel which is the seventh  channel above the requested channel. Compliance with this requirement  shall be determined based on a distance computation rounded to the  nearest kilometer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A UHF TV broadcast station application will not be accepted if  it specifies a site less than 32 kilometers from the transmitter site of  a UHF Class A TV station that is authorized an effective radiated power  of more than 50 kilowatts and operating on a channel which is the  second, third, or fourth channel above or below the requested channel.  Compliance with this requirement shall be determined based on a distance  computation rounded to the nearest kilometer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In cases where a TV broadcast station has been authorized  facilities that do not meet the distance separation requirements of this  section, an application to modify such a station's facilities will not  be accepted if it decreases that separation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> New interference must not be caused to Class A TV stations  authorized pursuant to Subpart J of this part, within the protected  contour defined in Sec.  73.6010 of this part. For this prediction, the  TV broadcast station field strength is calculated from the proposed  effective radiated power and the antenna height above average terrain in  pertinent directions using the methods in Sec.  73.684 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For co-channel protection, the field strength is calculated  using the appropriate F(50,10) chart from Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of  Sec.  73.699 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For TV broadcast stations that do not specify the same channel  as the Class A TV station to be protected, the field strength is  calculated using the appropriate F(50,50) chart from Figure 9, 10, or  10b of Sec.  73.699 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A TV broadcast station application will not be accepted if the  ratio in dB of its field strength to that of the Class A TV station at  the Class A TV station's protected contour fails to meet the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> -45 dB for co-channel operations where the Class A TV station  does not specify an offset carrier frequency or where the TV broadcast  and Class A TV stations do not specify different offset carrier  frequencies (zero, plus or minus) or -28 dB for offset carrier frequency  operation where the TV broadcast and Class A TV stations specify  different offset carrier frequencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 6 dB when the protected Class A TV station operates on a VHF  channel that is one channel above the requested channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 12 dB when the protected Class A TV station operates on a VHF  channel that is one channel below the requested channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 15 dB when the protected Class A TV station operates on a UHF  channel that is one channel above or below the requested channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 23 dB when the protected Class A TV station operates on a UHF  channel that is fourteen channels below the requested channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 6 dB when the protected Class A TV station operates on a UHF  channel that is fifteen channels below the requested channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> New interference must not be caused to digital Class A TV  stations authorized pursuant to Subpart J of this part, within the  protected contour defined in Sec.  73.6010 of this part. A TV broadcast  station application will not be accepted if the ratio in dB of the field  strength of the digital Class A TV station at the digital Class A TV  station's protected contour to the field strength resulting from the  facilities proposed in the TV broadcast station application fails to  meet the D/U signal ratios for ``analog TV-into-DTV'' specified in  Sec. Sec.  73.623(c)(2) and 73.623(c)(3) of this part. For digital Class  A TV station protection, the TV broadcast station field strength is  calculated from the proposed effective radiated power and the antenna  height above average terrain in pertinent directions using the methods  in Sec.  73.684 of this part and using the appropriate F(50,10) chart  from Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of Sec.  73.699 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> In cases where a TV broadcast station has been authorized  facilities that do not meet the interference protection   requirements of this section, an application to modify such a station's  facilities will not be accepted if it is predicted to cause new  interference within the protected contour of the Class A TV or digital  Class A TV station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In support of a request for waiver of the interference  protection requirements of this section, an applicant for a TV broadcast  station may make full use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain  dependent propagation methods to demonstrate that the proposed facility  would not be likely to cause interference to Class A TV stations.  Guidance on using the Longely-Rice methodology is provided in OET  Bulletin No. 69, which is available through the Internet at http:// www.fcc.gov/oet/info/documents/bulletins/69.
