Sampling.</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Selection of the size of the sample to be tested depends on the expected concentration of phosphorous in the sample. If a concentration of phosphorus is suspected to be less than 0.0038 g/gal (1.0 mg/litre), it will be necessary to use 10 ml of sample.</p><p class="depth0">Note 8: Two grams of zinc oxide cannot absorb this volume of gasoline. Therefore the 10-ml sample is ignited in aliquots of 2 ml in the presence of 2 g of zinc oxide.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 The following table serves as a guide for selecting sample size:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sample</p><p class="depth0">Phosphorus, milligrams per liter     Equivalent, grams per     size,</p><p class="depth0">gallon          milliliter------------------------------------------------------------------------2.5 to 40...........................  0.01 to 0.15..........        1.001.3 to 20...........................  0.005 to 0.075........        2.000.9 to 13...........................  0.0037 to 0.05........        3.001 or less...........................  0.0038 or less........       10.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">8. Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Transfer 2 0.2 g of zinc oxide into a conical pile in a clean, dry, unetched ignition dish.</p><p class="depth0">Note 9: In order to obtain satisfactory accuracy with the small amounts of phosphorus involved, it is necessary to take extensive precautions in handling. The usual precautions of cleanliness, careful manipulation, and avoidance of contamination should be scrupulously observed; also, all glassware should be cleaned before use, with cleaning acid or by some procedure that does not involve use of commercial detergents. These compounds often contain alkali phosphates which are strongly adsorbed by glass surfaces and are not removed by ordinary rinsing. It is desirable to segregate a special stock of glassware for use only in the determination of phosphorus.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Make a deep depression in the center of the zinc oxide pile with a stirring rod.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Pipet the gasoline sample (Note 10) (see 7.2 for suggested sample volume) into the depression in the zinc oxide. Record the temperature of the fuel if the phosphorus content is required at 60 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C) and make correction as directed in 9.2.</p><p class="depth0">Note 10: For the 10-ml sample use multiple additions and a syringe. Hold the tip of the needle at approximately \2/3\ of the depth of the zinc oxide layer and slowly deliver 2 ml of the sample: fast sample delivery may give low results. Give sufficient time for the gasoline to be absorbed by the zinc oxide. Follow step 8.6. Cool the dish to room temperature. Repeat steps 8.3 and 8.6 until all the sample has been burned. Safety--cool the ignition dish before adding the additional aliquots of gasoline to avoid a flash fire.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Cover the sample with a small amount of fresh zinc oxide from reagent bottle (use the tip of a small spatula to deliver approximately 0.2 g). Tap the sides of the ignition dish to pack the zinc oxide.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Prepare the blank, using the same amount of zinc oxide in an ignition dish.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 Ignite the gasoline, using the flame from a bunsen burner. Allow the gasoline to burn to extinction (Note 10).</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Place the ignition dishes containing the sample and blank in a hot muffle furnace set at a temperature of 1150 to 1300 [deg]F (621 to 704 [deg]C) for 10 min. Remove and cool the ignition dishes. When cool gently tap the sides of the dish to loosen the zinc oxide. Again place the dishes in the muffle furnace for 5 min. Remove and cool the ignition dishes to room temperature. The above treatment is usually sufficient to burn the carbon. If the carbon is not completely burned off place the dish into the oven for further 5-min. periods.</p><p class="depth0">Note 11: Step 8.7 may also be accomplished by heating the ignition dish with a Meker burner gradually increasing the intensity of

heat until the carbon from the sides of the dish has been burned, then cool to room temperature.</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Pipet 25 ml of H2 SO4 (1+10) to each ignition dish. While pipeting, carefully wash all traces of zinc oxide from the sides of the ignition dish.</p><p class="depth0">8.9 Cover the ignition dish with a borosilicate watch glass and warm the ignition dish on a hot plate until the zinc oxide is completely dissolved.</p><p class="depth0">8.10 Transfer the solution through filter paper to a 100-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the watch glass and the dish several times with distilled water (do not exceed 25 ml) and transfer the washings through the filter paper to the volumetric flask.</p><p class="depth0">8.11 Prepare the molybdate-hydrazine solution.</p><p class="depth0">8.12 Add 50 ml of the molybdate-hydrazine solution by pipet to each 100-ml volumetric flask. Mix immediately by swirling.</p><p class="depth0">8.13 Dilute to 100 ml with water and mix well. Remove stoppers from flasks after mixing.</p><p class="depth0">8.14 Place the 100-ml flasks in the constant-temperature bath for 25 min. so that the contents of the flasks are below the liquid level of the bath. The temperature of the bath should be 180 to 190 [deg]F (82.2 to 87.8 [deg]C) (Note 1).</p><p class="depth0">8.15 Transfer the 100-ml flasks to the cooling bath and cool the contents rapidly to room temperature (Note 6).</p><p class="depth0">8.16 Allow the samples to stand at room temperature before measuring the absorbance.</p><p class="depth0">Note 12: The color developed is stable for at least 4 h.</p><p class="depth0">8.17 Set the spectrophotometer to the wavelength of maximum absorbance as determined in 6.9.

If a more limited range is desired as required for linearity, such range shall be covered by at least five standard solutions approximately equally spaced and this range shall not be exceeded by any of the samples. Place each of the standard solutions in a sample cell using techniques consistent with good operating practice for the spectrometer employed. Insert the sample in the spectrometer and allow the spectrometer atmosphere to reach equilibrium (if appropriate). Measure the intensity of the lead L alpha peak at 1.175 angstroms, the Compton scatter peak of the tungsten L alpha line at 1.500 angstroms and the background at 1.211 angstroms. Each measured intensity should exceed 200,000 counts or the time of measurement should be at least 30 seconds. The relative standard deviation of each measurement, based on counting statistics, should be one percent or less. The Compton scatter peak given above is for 90[deg] instrument geometry and should be changed for other geometries. The Compton scatter peak (in angstroms) is found at the wavelength of the tungsten L alpha line plus 0.024 (1-cos phi), where phi is the angle between the incident radiation and the take-off collimator.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 For Each of the standards, as well as for an isooctane blank, determine the net lead intensity by subtracting the corrected

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
INQUIRIES</p><p class="depth0">For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency.
