                            <p class="depth0">NRCS will establish program outreach activities at the national,  State, Tribal, and local levels in order to ensure that producers whose  land has environmental problems and priority resource concerns are aware  and informed that they may be eligible to apply for program assistance.  Special outreach will be made to eligible producers with historically  low participation rates, including but not restricted to, limited  resource, socially disadvantaged, small-scale, or beginning farmers or  ranchers, veteran farmers or ranchers, Indian Tribes, Alaska Natives,  and Pacific Islanders. NRCS provides outreach so as not to limit  producer participation because of size or type of operation, or  production system, including small-scale, specialty crop, and organic  production.</p>
