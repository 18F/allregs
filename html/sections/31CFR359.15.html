                                Sec. 359.15  When is the composite rate applied to Series I savings bonds?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The most recently announced composite rate applies to a bond during  its next semiannual rate period. A bond's semiannual rate periods are  consecutive six-month periods, the first of which begins with the bond's  issue date. This means that there can be a delay of several months from  the time of a composite rate announcement to the time that rate  determines interest earnings for a bond. For example, if you purchased a  bond in April, its semiannual rate periods begin every April and  October. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in April, the  most recently announced composite rate would have been the rate we  announced the previous November. This rate will determine interest  earnings for your bond for the next six months, through the end of  September. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in October,  the most recently announced composite rate would be the rate announced  the previous May. This rate will determine interest earnings for your  bond through the end of the following March. However, if you purchased a  bond instead in May, its semiannual rate periods begin in May and  November. Therefore, the composite rates announced in May and November  will apply immediately to this bond. (See appendix C to part 359 at  Sec. 2 for a discussion of rate lag.)</p>
