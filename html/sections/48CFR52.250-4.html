                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 50.206(c)(1), insert the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Safety Act Pre-Qualification Designation Notice (FEB 2009)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this provision--</p><p class="depth0">Act of terrorism means any act determined to have met the following  requirements or such other requirements as defined and specified by the  Secretary of Homeland Security:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is unlawful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Causes harm, including financial harm, to a person, property, or  entity, in the United States, or in the case of a domestic United States  air carrier or a United States-flag vessel (or a vessel based  principally in the United States on which United States income tax is  paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United  States), in or outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Uses or attempts to use instrumentalities, weapons or other  methods designed or intended to cause mass destruction, injury or other  loss to citizens or institutions of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Block certification means SAFETY Act certification of a technology  class that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined to  be an approved class of approved products for homeland security.</p><p class="depth0">Block designation means SAFETY Act designation of a technology class  that the DHS has determined to be a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology  (QATT).</p><p class="depth0">Pre-qualification designation notice means a notice in a procurement  solicitation or other publication by the Government stating that the  technology to be procured either affirmatively or presumptively  satisfies the technical criteria necessary to be deemed a qualified  anti-terrorism technology. A pre-qualification designation notice  authorizes offeror(s) to submit streamlined SAFETY   Act applications for SAFETY Act designation and receive expedited  processing of those applications.</p><p class="depth0">Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (QATT) means any technology  designed, developed, modified, procured, or sold for the purpose of  preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism or  limiting the harm such acts might otherwise cause, for which a SAFETY  Act designation has been issued. For purposes of defining a QATT,  technology means any product, equipment, service (including support  services), device, or technology (including information technology) or  any combination of the foregoing. Design services, consulting services,  engineering services, software development services, software  integration services, threat assessments, vulnerability studies, and  other analyses relevant to homeland security may be deemed a technology.</p><p class="depth0">SAFETY Act certification means a determination by DHS pursuant to 6  U.S.C. 442(d), as further delineated in 6 CFR 25.9, that a QATT for  which a SAFETY Act designation has been issued is an approved product  for homeland security, i.e., it will perform as intended, conforms to  the seller's specifications, and is safe for use as intended.</p><p class="depth0">SAFETY Act designation means a determination by DHS pursuant to 6  U.S.C. 441(b) and 6 U.S.C. 443(a), as further delineated in 6 CFR 25.4,  that a particular Anti-Terrorism Technology constitutes a QATT under the  SAFETY Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies  Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act), 6 U.S.C. 441-444, creates certain liability  limitations for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an  act of terrorism where QATTs have been deployed. It also confers other  important benefits. SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification  are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing,  detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the  harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other  prescribed criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DHS has issued a SAFETY Act pre-qualification designation  notice for the technology to be acquired under this solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This notice is attached to this solicitation and contains  essential information, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of and specification for the technology  covered by the notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the technology described and specified in the  notice satisfies the technical criteria to be deemed a QATT and the  offeror's proposed technology either may presumptively or will qualify  for the issuance of a designation provided the offeror complies with  terms and conditions in the notice and its application is approved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The period of time within which DHS will take action upon  submission of a SAFETY Act application submitted pursuant to the notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A listing of those portions of the application that must be  completed and submitted by selected awardees and the time periods for  such submissions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The date of expiration of the notice; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any other terms and conditions concerning the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Offerors should read this notice carefully to make sure they  comply with the terms of the notice if they plan on taking advantage of  SAFETY Act coverage for their technologies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> All determinations by DHS are based on factors set forth in the  SAFETY Act and its implementing regulations. A determination by DHS to  issue a SAFETY Act designation, or not to issue a SAFETY Act designation  for a particular Technology as a QATT is not a determination that the  Technology meets, or fails to meet, the requirements of any solicitation  issued by any Federal, State, local or tribal governments.  Determinations by DHS with respect to whether to issue a SAFETY Act  designation for Technologies submitted for DHS review are based on the  factors identified in 6 CFR 25.4(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Neither SAFETY Act designation nor certification is in any way a  requirement of this action. Whether to seek the benefits of the SAFETY  Act for a proposed product or service is entirely up to the offeror.  Additional information about the SAFETY Act may be found at the SAFETY  Act website at http://www.SAFETYAct.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Proposals in which pricing or any other terms or conditions are  offered contingent upon SAFETY Act designation or certification of the  proposed product(s) or service(s) will not be considered for award.</p><p class="depth0">(End of provision)</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (FEB 2009). As prescribed in 50.206(c)(2), substitute the  following paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Offerors are authorized to submit proposals made contingent  upon SAFETY Act designation before award. When an offer is made  contingent upon SAFETY Act designation, the offeror also may submit an  alternate offer without the contingency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an offer is submitted contingent upon receipt of SAFETY Act  designation prior to contract award, then the Government may not award a  contract based on such offer unless the offeror demonstrates prior to  award that DHS has issued a SAFETY Act designation for the offeror's  technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Government reserves the right to award the contract based on  a noncontingent   offer, prior to DHS resolution of the offeror's application for SAFETY  Act designation.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate II (FEB 2009). As prescribed in 50.206(c)(3), substitute  the following paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Offerors are authorized to submit proposals presuming SAFETY  Act designation before or after award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An offeror is eligible for award only if the offeror--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Files a SAFETY Act designation application, limited to the scope  of the applicable prequalification designation notice, within 15 days  after submission of the proposal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursues its SAFETY Act designation application in good faith;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Agrees to obtain the amount of insurance DHS requires for  issuing the offeror's SAFETY Act designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If DHS has not issued a SAFETY Act designation to the successful  offeror before contract award, the contracting officer will include the  clause at 52.250-5 in the resulting contract.
