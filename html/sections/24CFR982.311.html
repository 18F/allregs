                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payments under HAP contract. Housing assistance payments are  paid to the owner in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract.  Housing assistance payments may only be paid to the owner during the  lease term, and while the family is residing in the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination of payment: When owner terminates the lease. Housing  assistance payments terminate when the lease is terminated by the owner  in accordance with the lease. However, if the owner has commenced the  process to evict the tenant, and if the family continues to reside in  the unit, the PHA must continue to make housing assistance payments to  the owner in   accordance with the HAP contract until the owner has obtained a court  judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant. The  PHA may continue such payments until the family moves from or is evicted  from the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of payment: Other reasons for termination. Housing  assistance payments terminate if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lease terminates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The HAP contract terminates; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA terminates assistance for the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Family move-out. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the family moves out of the unit, the  PHA may not make any housing assistance payment to the owner for any  month after the month when the family moves out. The owner may keep the  housing assistance payment for the month when the family moves out of  the unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a participant family moves from an assisted unit with  continued tenant-based assistance, the term of the assisted lease for  the new assisted unit may begin during the month the family moves out of  the first assisted unit. Overlap of the last housing assistance payment  (for the month when the family moves out of the old unit) and the first  assistance payment for the new unit, is not considered to constitute a  duplicative housing subsidy.
