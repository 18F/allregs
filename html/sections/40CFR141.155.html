                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each  community water system must mail or otherwise directly deliver one copy  of the report to each customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The system must make a good faith effort to reach consumers who  do not get water bills, using means recommended by the primacy agency.  EPA expects that an adequate good faith effort will be tailored to the  consumers who are served by the system but are not bill-paying  customers, such as renters or workers. A good faith effort to reach  consumers would include a mix of methods appropriate to the particular  system such as: Posting the reports on the Internet; mailing to postal  patrons in metropolitan areas; advertising the availability of the  report in the news media; publication in a local newspaper; posting in  public places such as cafeterias or lunch rooms of public buildings;  delivery of multiple copies for distribution by single-biller customers  such as apartment buildings or large private employers; delivery to  community organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No later than the date the system is required to distribute the  report to its customers, each community water system must mail a copy of  the report to the primacy agency, followed within 3 months by a  certification that the report has been distributed to customers, and  that the information is correct and consistent with the compliance  monitoring data previously submitted to the primacy agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No later than the date the system is required to distribute the  report to its customers, each community water system must deliver the  report to any other agency or clearinghouse identified by the primacy  agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Each community water system must make its reports available to  the public upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Each community water system serving 100,000 or more persons must  post its current year's report to a publicly-accessible site on the  Internet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Governor of a State or his designee, or the Tribal Leader  where the tribe has met the eligibility requirements contained in Sec.   142.72 for the purposes of waiving the mailing requirement, can waive  the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for community water  systems serving fewer than 10,000 persons. In consultation with the  tribal government, the Regional Administrator may waive the requirement  of Sec.  141.155(a) in areas in   Indian country where no tribe has been deemed eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such systems must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Publish the reports in one or more local newspapers serving the  area in which the system is located;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inform the customers that the reports will not be mailed,  either in the newspapers in which the reports are published or by other  means approved by the State; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Make the reports available to the public upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Systems serving 500 or fewer persons may forego the requirements  of paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section if they provide notice  at least once per year to their customers by mail, door-to-door delivery  or by posting in an appropriate location that the report is available  upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Any system subject to this subpart must retain copies of its  Consumer Confidence Report for no less than 3 years.
