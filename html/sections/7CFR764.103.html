If the applicant's assets do not provide  adequate security, the Agency may accept:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pledge of security from a third party; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interests in property not owned by the applicant (such as leases  that provide a mortgageable value, water rights, easements, mineral  rights, and royalties).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An additional amount of security up to 150 percent of the loan  amount will be taken when available, except for downpayment loans, MLs  made for purposes other than annual operating, and youth loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Agency will choose the best security available when there  are several alternatives that meet the Agency's security requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Agency will take a lien on all assets that are not essential  to the farming operation and are not being converted to cash to reduce  the loan amount when each such asset, or aggregate value of like assets  (such as stocks), has a value in excess of $5,000. The value of this  security is not included in the Agency's additional security requirement  stated in paragraph (c) of this section. This requirement does not apply  to downpayment loans, CL, ML, or youth loans.
