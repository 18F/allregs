                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In general, you have to prove to us that you are blind  or disabled. You must inform us about or submit all evidence known to  you that relates to whether or not you are blind or disabled. This duty  is ongoing and requires you to disclose any additional related evidence  about which you become aware. This duty applies at each level of the  administrative review process, including the Appeals Council level if  the evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the  administrative law judge hearing decision. We will consider only  impairment(s) you say you have or about which we receive evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What we mean by ``evidence.'' Evidence is anything you or anyone  else submits to us or that we obtain that relates to your claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Objective medical evidence, that is, medical signs and  laboratory findings as defined in Sec. 416.928(b) and (c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other evidence from medical sources, such as medical history,  opinions, and statements about treatment you have received;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Statements you or others make about your impairment(s), your  restrictions, your daily activities, your efforts to work, or any other  statements you make to medical sources during the course of examination  or treatment, or to us during interviews, on applications, in letters,  and in testimony in our administrative proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information from other sources, as described in  Sec. 416.913(d);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Decisions by any governmental or nongovernmental agency about  whether or not you are disabled or blind (see Sec. 416.904);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> At the initial level of the administrative review process, when  a State agency disability examiner makes the initial determination alone  (see Sec. 416.1015(c)(3)), opinions provided by State agency medical and  psychological consultants and other program physicians, psychologists,  or other medical specialists based on their review of the evidence in  your case record (see Sec. 416.927(e)(1)(ii));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> At the reconsideration level of the administrative review  process, when a State agency disability examiner makes the determination  alone (see Sec. 416.1015(c)(3)), findings, other than the ultimate  determination about whether or not you are disabled, made by the State  agency medical or psychological consultants and other program  physicians, psychologists, or other medical specialists at the initial  level of the administrative review process, and other opinions they  provide based on their review of the evidence in your case record at the  initial and reconsideration levels (see Sec. 416.927(e)(1)(iii)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At the administrative law judge and Appeals Council levels,  findings, other than the ultimate determination about whether or not you  are disabled, made by State agency medical or psychological consultants  and other program physicians or psychologists, or other medical  specialists, and opinions expressed by medical experts or psychological  experts that we consult based on their review of the evidence in your  case record (see Secs. 416.927(e)(2)-(3)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  evidence does not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Oral or written communications between you and your  representative that are subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless  you voluntarily disclose the communication to us; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your representative's analysis of your claim, unless he or she  voluntarily discloses it to us. Your representative's ``analysis of your  claim,'' means information that is subject to the attorney work product  doctrine, but it does not include medical evidence, medical source  opinions, or any other factual matter that we may consider in  determining whether or not you are eligible for benefits (see paragraph  (b)(2)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) apply to communications  between you and your non-attorney representative only if the  communications would be subject to the attorney-client privilege, if  your non-attorney representative were an attorney. The provisions of  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) apply to the analysis of your claim by your non- attorney representative only if the analysis of your claim would be  subject to the attorney work product doctrine, if your non-attorney  representative were an attorney.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The attorney-client privilege generally protects confidential  communications between an attorney and his or her client that are  related to providing or obtaining legal advice. The attorney work  product doctrine generally protects an attorney's analysis, theories,  mental impressions, and notes. In the context of your disability claim,  neither the attorney-client privilege nor the attorney work product  doctrine allows you to withhold factual information, medical source  opinions, or other medical evidence that we may consider in determining  whether or not you are eligible for benefits. For example, if you tell  your representative about the medical sources you have seen, your  representative cannot refuse to disclose the identity of those medical  sources to us based on the attorney-client privilege. As another  example, if your representative asks a medical source to complete an  opinion form related to your impairment(s), symptoms, or limitations,  your representative cannot withhold the completed opinion form from us  based on the attorney work product doctrine. The attorney work product  doctrine would not protect the source's opinions on the completed form,  regardless of whether or not your representative used the form in his or  her analysis of your claim or made handwritten notes on the face of the  report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your responsibility. You must inform us about or submit all  evidence known to you that relates to whether or not you are blind or  disabled. When you submit evidence received from another source, you  must submit that evidence in its entirety, unless you previously  submitted the same evidence to us or we instruct you otherwise. If we  ask you, you must inform us about:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your medical source(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your age;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your education and training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Your work experience;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Your daily activities both before and after the date you say  that you became disabled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Your efforts to work; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other factors showing how your impairment(s) affects your  ability to work. In Secs. 416.960 through 416.969a, we discuss in more  detail the evidence we need when we consider vocational factors.</p><p class="depth3">* * * * *</p>
