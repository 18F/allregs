The application shall be accompanied by

three (3) copies of the SOP developed by the air carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval criteria. Upon receipt, each application will be reviewed to determine whether the procedures contained therein meet the requirements of the ACSPP. In determining whether a SOP submitted by an applicant carrier contains sufficient detail to assure the proper level of care and diligence required under the provisions of the ACSPP, the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, will apply uniform standards and verify that, at a minimum, procedures are in place which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assure positive security background checks are performed on all carrier employees, both those employed within the United States and without, who have access to baggage, cargo or secure areas on participating routes, to the extent permitted by law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assure a system of positive baggage and cargo identification is employed at all terminals used by the carrier;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assure the carrier employs a system to assure that no unmanifested cargo is placed on board the conveyance or brought into the United States on any of their conveyances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assure the carrier has specific procedures through which it will notify Customs should it discover any unmanifested or improperly manifested cargo on any of its conveyances or in any area subject to its control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assure the carrier has an effective and practical employee awareness training program in place; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Assure thorough security measures are implemented at all foreign departure points on ACSPP participating routes which will assure that the carrier has control and knowledge of the baggage, cargo, passenger and other materials placed on board its aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptance and notification. Upon verification by Customs that a carrier's SOP meets all the criteria outlined in Sec. 122.173(b) of this part, the carrier will be notified that its application to the ACSPP has been accepted. Acceptance into the ACSPP is made with the understanding and expectation that the carrier will continue to act with the highest degree of care and diligence required under law and that it will abide by and perform all elements of its approved SOP.
