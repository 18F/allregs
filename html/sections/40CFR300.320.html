                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally  should be taken in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such  as the threat posed to public health or welfare of the United States or  the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the  source of the discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officially classify the size (i.e., minor, medium, major) and  type (i.e., substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the  United States, worst case discharge) of the discharge and determine the  course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate  removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges  that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or  welfare   of the United States may be further classified as a spill of national  significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of the USCG.  The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in Sec. Sec.  300.322, 300.323, and 300.324.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major  discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium  discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if  appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor  discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that  proper removal action is being taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal,  mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private  party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial  threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, determine  whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out  removal. Removal is being done properly when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The responsible party is applying the resources called for in  its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or  mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable  regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible  party resources with government resources, the spill response will not  be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political  subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal  actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural  resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the  OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected  states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding  shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal  actions under applicable state law.</p>
