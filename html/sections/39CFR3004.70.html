Any person who submits materials to the Commission (submitter) that the submitter reasonably believes to be exempt from public disclosure may submit materials under seal and lodge an application for nonpublic treatment as described in Sec. 3007.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of request. Except as provided in Sec. 3004.30(d), if a FOIA request seeks materials designated as nonpublic materials, the Commission will provide the submitter with notice of the request. The Commission may also provide notice when it has reason to believe that third-party materials possibly exempt from disclosure may fall within the scope of any FOIA request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Objections to disclosure. A submitter may file written objections to the request specifying all grounds for withholding the information under FOIA within 7 days of the date of the notice. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice, the submitter will be considered to have no objection, beyond those objections articulated in its application for nonpublic treatment pursuant to Sec. 3007.10 of this chapter, to the disclosure of the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of decision. If, after considering the submitter's objections to disclosure the Commission decides to disclose the information, it will give the submitter written notice of the decision and a brief explanation of the reasons for not sustaining the submitter's objections. The actual disclosure will not be made before 3 days after publication of the Commission's decision.</p>
