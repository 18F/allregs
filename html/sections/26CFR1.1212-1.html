The net capital loss is $50,000. This figure is the excess of the losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets over the sum of (1) gains (in this case, none) from sales or exchanges of capital assets, and (2) net income (computed without regard to capital gains and losses) of $500. This amount may be carried forward in full as a short-term loss to 1953. However, in 1953 there was a net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) of $20,500, as defined by section 117(a)(10)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and limited by section 117(e)(1) of the 1939 Code, against which this net capital loss of $50,000 is allowed in part. The remaining portion--$29,500--may be carried forward to 1954 and 1955 since there was no net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) in 1954. In 1955 this $29,500 is allowed in full against net capital gain of $36,000, as defined by paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1222-1 and limited by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Net capital loss of 1954. The net capital loss is $19,500. This figure is the excess of the losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets over the sum of (1) gains (in this case, none) from sales or exchanges of capital assets and (2) taxable income (computed without regard to capital gains and losses and the deductions provided in section 151) of $500. This amount may be carried forward in full as a short-term loss to 1955. The net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) in 1955, before deduction of any carryovers, is $36,000. (See sections 1222(9)(B) and 1212 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as it existed prior to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964.) The $29,500 balance of the 1952 loss is first applied against the $36,000, leaving a balance of $6,500. Against this amount the $19,500 loss arising in 1954 is applied, leaving a loss of $13,000, which may be carried forward to 1956. Since this amount is treated as a short-term capital loss in 1956 under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss is $2,000 ($15,000 minus $13,000). Half of this excess is allowable as a deduction under section 1202. Thus, after also deducting the exemption allowed as a deduction under section 151 ($600), the taxpayer has a taxable income of $900 ($2,500 minus $1,600) for 1956.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporations sustaining foreign expropriation capital losses for taxable years ending after December 31, 1958--(i) In general. A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1958, any portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, shall carry over such portion of the loss to each of the ten succeeding taxable years and treat it in each of such succeeding taxable years as a short-term capital loss to the extent and consistent with the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount, not in excess of the net capital loss for such year, of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year. The portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss shall be treated as a separate net capital loss for that year and shall be applied, after first applying the remaining portion of such net capital loss, to offset any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in a succeeding taxable year. In applying net capital losses of two or more taxable years to offset the capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of a subsequent taxable year, such net capital losses shall be offset

against such capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year, even though one or more of such net capital losses are attributable in whole or in part to a foreign expropriation capital loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1958, any portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, shall carry over such portion of the loss to each of the ten succeeding taxable years and treat it in each of such succeeding taxable years as a short-term capital loss to the extent and consistent with the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount, not in excess of the net capital loss for such year, of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year. The portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss shall be treated as a separate net capital loss for that year and shall be applied, after first applying the remaining portion of such net capital loss, to offset any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in a succeeding taxable year. In applying net capital losses of two or more taxable years to offset the capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of a subsequent taxable year, such net capital losses shall be offset

against such capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year, even though one or more of such net capital losses are attributable in whole or in part to a foreign expropriation capital loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign expropriation capital loss defined. For purposes of this subaparagraph the term foreign expropriation capital loss means, for any taxable year, the sum of the losses taken into account in computing the net capital loss for such year which are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Losses sustained directly by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Losses (treated under section 165 (g)(1) as losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets) from securities which become worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a domestic corporation which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, owns as a capital asset 75 percent of the outstanding stock of Y, a foreign corporation operating in a foreign country. In 1961, the foreign country seizes all of the assets of Y, rendering X's stock in Y worthless and thus causing X to sustain a $40,000 foreign expropriation capital loss for such year. In 1961, X has $30,000 of other losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets and $50,000 of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets. X's net capital loss for 1961 is $20,000 ($70,000-$50,000). Since the foreign expropriation capital loss exceeds this amount, the entire $20,000 is a foreign expropriation capital loss for 1961.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Z, a domestic corporation which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, has a net capital loss of $50,000 for 1961, $30,000 of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss. Pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, $30,000 of such net capital loss shall be carried over as a short-term capital loss to each of the 10 taxable years succeeding 1961, and the remaining $20,000 of the net capital loss shall be carried over as a short-term capital loss to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding 1961. Z has a $35,000 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) (determined without regard to any capital loss carryover) for 1962. In offsetting the $50,000 capital loss carryover from 1961 against the $35,000 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for 1962, the $30,000 portion of such carryover which is attributable to the foreign expropriation capital loss for 1961 is applied against the 1962 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) after applying the $20,000 remaining portion of the carryover. Thus, there is a capital loss carryover of $15,000 to 1963, all of which is attributable to the foreign expropriation capital loss for 1961. Z has a net capital loss for 1963 of $10,000, no portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss. For 1964, Z has a net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) of $22,000 (determined without regard to the capital loss carryovers from 1961 and 1963). In offsetting the capital loss carryovers from 1961 and 1963 against Z's $22,000 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for 1964, the $15,000 carryover from 1961 is applied against the 1964 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) before the $10,000 capital loss carryover from 1963 is applied against such gain. Thus, $3,000 of the 1963 net capital loss remains to be carried over to 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Regular net capital loss sustained by a corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969--(i) General rule.

The entire amount of the net capital loss for any loss year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried, and the portion of such net capital loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such net capital loss over the total of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (computed without regard to the capital loss carryback from the loss year or any taxable year thereafter) for each of the prior taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules. (a) In the case of a net capital loss which is not a foreign expropriation capital loss and which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of section 1212(a)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph because such loss would produce or increase a net operating loss in such preceding taxable year, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such preceding taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such net capital loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of section 1212(a)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the rules applicable to the portion of a net capital loss of a corporation which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss sustained in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, see section 1212(a)(2) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 1212(a)(1)(A) and subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph shall not apply to (and no carryback shall be allowed with respect to) the net capital loss of a corporation for any taxable year for which such corporation is an electing small business corporation under subchapter S.

This subdivision shall not extend the carryover period prescribed in subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph to a year in which a corporation is not a regulated investment company as defined in section 851.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the corporation is not, and never has been, a corporation described in subdivision (iii) (c) or (d) of this subparagraph, that the corporation files its tax returns on a calendar year basis, and that no capital loss sustained is a foreign expropriation capital loss:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

The entire net capital loss for 1970 may be carried back to 1967, but only to the extent that a net operating loss for 1967 would not be produced or increased. The amount of the carryback to 1968 is the excess of the net capital loss for 1970 over the net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for 1967, computed without regard to a capital loss carryback from 1970 or any taxable year thereafter. The amount of the carryback to 1969 is the excess of the net capital loss for 1970 over the sum of the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for 1967 and 1968, computed without regard to a capital loss carryback from 1970 or any taxable year thereafter. The amount of the carryover to 1971 is the excess of the net capital loss for 1970 over the sum of the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for 1967, 1968, and 1969, computed without regard to a capital loss carryback from 1970 or any taxable year thereafter. Similarly, the amount of the carryover to 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1975, respectively, is the excess of the net capital loss for 1970 over the sum of the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for taxable years prior to 1972, 1973, 1974, or 1975, as the case may be, to which the net capital loss for 1970 may be carried, computed without regard to a capital loss carryback from 1970 or any year thereafter.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The net capital loss for 1969 is the oldest that may be carried to 1973, and thus, it is the first carried over and absorbed by the net capital gain for 1973.

The rules provided in this subdivision are for the purpose of taking into account the additional allowance deductible for the current taxable year under section 1211(b) and Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(2) in determining the amount and character of capital loss carryovers from the current taxable year to the succeeding taxable year. Their practical application to a determination of the amount and character of capital loss carryovers from the current taxable year to the succeeding taxable year involves identification of the net long-term and net short-term capital loss components of the additional allowance deductible in the current taxable year as provided by Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(2)(iii). To the extent that the additional allowance is composed of net short-term capital losses, such losses are treated as a short-term capital gain in the current taxable year in determining the capital loss carryovers to the succeeding year. To the extent that the additional allowance is composed of net long-term capital losses applied pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(2)(iii), an amount equal to twice the amount of such component of the additional allowance is treated as a short-term capital gain in the current taxable year.

A taxpayer other than a corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, shall treat as a short-term capital loss in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, any amount which would be treated as a short-term capital loss in such year under subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code as in effect immediately before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transitional rule for net long-term capital losses sustained in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970. In the case of a net long-term capital loss sustained by a taxpayer other than a corporation in a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1970 (referred to in this section as a pre-1970 taxable year) which is carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969 (referred to in this section as a post-1969 taxable year), the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for the taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1211(b) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(3), and the amount of such long-term capital loss carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1212(b)(1) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (instead of under sections 1211(b) and 1212(b)(1) as in effect for post-1969 taxable years

and Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, respectively) but only to the extent that such pre-1970 long-term capital loss constitutes a transitional net long-term capital loss component (determined as provided in Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(3)(ii)) in the taxable year to which such pre-1970 long-term capital loss is carried. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (2) of this section, to the extent that a component of the transitional additional allowance deductible for a post-1969 taxable year under section 1211(b) and Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(3)(i) is a transitional net long-term capital loss component carried over to such post-1969 taxable year, such component shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in determining the amount and character of capital loss carryovers from such post-1969 taxable year to the succeeding taxable year. Such component shall be so treated as a short-term capital gain in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis and shall not be doubled for this purpose as is provided by subdivision (ii) of paragraph (2) of this section in the case of a component of the additional allowance made up of net long-term capital losses applied pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1211-1(b)(2)(iii). The transitional rule provided in this paragraph does not apply to a determination of the character of capital losses (as long-term or short-term) actually deductible for the current taxable year under section 1211(b) and Sec. 1.1211-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples.

For 1970, an unmarried individual filing a separate return has taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) of $8,000, and a long-term capital loss of $2,000. He also has a pre-1970 long-term capital loss of $2,500 which is carried to 1970. In 1970, the taxpayer would deduct as the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) $1,000, absorbing $1,000 of the pre-1970 long-term capital loss of $2,500. He would carry to 1971 the unused $1,500 balance of his pre-1970 long-term capital loss plus the 1970 long-term capital loss of $2,000, or a total of $3,500, for use in 1971.</p><p class="depth0">For 1971, the same taxpayer filing a separate return with taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) of $8,000, has a $3,600 long-term capital gain and a $2,200 long-term capital loss. When these gains and losses are combined with the long-term capital loss carryover from 1970 of $3,500, a net long-term capital loss of $2,100 results. He would deduct $1,000 as the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b). The $1,000 additional allowance would absorb $100 of the unused pre-1970 long-term capital loss carryover of $1,500 plus $1,800 of the unused post-1969 long-term capital loss carryover of $2,100 (the amount of the 1971 net long-term capital loss necessary to make up the remaining $900 balance of the additional allowance). Although a component of the 1971 net long-term capital loss is the unused pre-1970 long-term capital loss carryover of $1,500, only $100 of this carryover is available for use in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis in computing the transitional additional allowance for 1971 since it only exceeds by that

amount the $1,400 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) actually realized in 1971 all of which is net long-term capital gain (long-term capital gain of $3,600 reduced by long-term capital loss of $2,200). See Sec. 1.1221-1(b)(3)(ii). The taxpayer would carry over to 1972 as a long-term capital loss the remaining $200 of the 1971 long-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. For 1970, an unmarried individual has taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) of $8,000 and a short-term capital loss of $700. He also has a pre-1970 long-term capital loss carryover of $1,200. He would deduct $1,000 as the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b). The $1,000 transitional additional allowance would be composed of the 1970 short-term capital loss of $700 and $300 of the pre-1970 long-term capital loss carryover. He would carry over to 1971 the unused $900 balance of his $1,200 pre-1970 long-term capital loss carryover for use in 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Husband and wife. (1) The following rules shall be applied in computing capital loss carryovers by husband and wife:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following rules shall be applied in computing capital loss carryovers by husband and wife:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a husband and wife making a joint return for any taxable year made separate returns for the preceding year, any capital loss carryovers of each spouse from such preceding taxable year may be carried forward to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a joint return was made for the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover from such preceding taxable year may be carried forward to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a husband and wife make separate returns for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, or any prior taxable year, and they made a joint return for the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover from such preceding taxable year shall be allocated to the spouses on the basis of their individual net capital loss which gave rise to such capital loss carryover. The capital loss carryover so allocated to each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a husband and wife making separate returns for any taxable year following the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, made a joint return for the preceding taxable year, any long-term or short-term capital loss carryovers shall be allocated to the spouses on the basis of their individual net long-term and net short-term capital losses for the preceding taxable year which gave rise to such capital loss carryovers, and the portions of the long-term or short-term capital loss carryovers so allocated to each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If separate returns are made both for the taxable year and the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover of each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of subparagraph (1) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. If H and W, husband and wife, make a joint return for 1955, having made separate returns for 1954 in which H had a net capital loss of $3,000 and W had a net capital loss of $2,000, in their joint return for 1955 they would have a short-term capital loss of $5,000 (the sum of their separate capital loss carryovers from 1954), allowable in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If, on the other hand, they make separate returns in 1955 following a joint return in 1954 in which their net capital loss was $5,000 allocable $3,000 to H and $2,000 to W, the carryover of H as a short-term capital loss for the purpose of his 1955 separate return would be $3,000 and that of W for her separate return would be $2,000, each allowable in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. H and W, husband and wife, make separate returns for 1966 following a joint return for 1965. The capital gains and losses incurred by H and W in 1965, including those carried over by them to 1965, were as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">H           W------------------------------------------------------------------------Long-term capital gains.........................      $8,000      $9,000Long-term capital losses........................    (15,000)     (6,000)Short-term capital gains........................      10,000       4,000Short-term capital losses.......................    (19,000)     (5,000)------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, in 1965 H and W had a net capital loss of $14,000 on their joint return. Of this amount, $4,000 was a long-term capital loss carryover, and $10,000 was a short-term capital loss carryover, determined in accordance paragraph (b) of this section. H's net long-

term capital loss was $7,000 for 1965. This amount was offset on the joint return by W's net long-term capital gain of $3,000. Thus, H may carry over to his separate return for 1966, a long-term capital loss carryover of $4,000. H and W may carry over to their separate returns for 1966, as short-term capital loss carryovers, the amounts of their respective net short-term losses from 1965, $9,000 and $1,000.
