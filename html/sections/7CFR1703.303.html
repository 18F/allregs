                                Sec. 1703.303  Eligibility criteria for deferment of loan payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The deferment of loan payments may be granted to any borrower that is not financially distressed, delinquent on any Federal debt, or in bankruptcy proceedings. However, the deferment of loan payments will not be granted to a borrower during any period in which the Administrator has determined that no additional financial assistance of any nature should be provided to the borrower pursuant to any provision of the RE Act. The determination to suspend eligibility for the deferment of loan payments under this subpart will be based on:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The borrower's demonstrated unwillingness to exercise diligence in repaying loans made by RUS or RTB or guaranteed by RUS that results in the Administrator being unable to find that such loans, would be repaid within the time agreed; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The borrower's demonstrated unwillingness to meet the requirements in RUS's or RTB's legal documents or regulations.</p>
