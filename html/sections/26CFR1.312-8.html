                                Sec. 1.312-8  Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to determine the effect on earnings and profits, where  a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) from a second  corporation a distribution which (under the law applicable to the year  in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the  shareholders of the second corporation, section 312(f) prescribes  certain rules. It provides that the amount of such distribution shall  not increase the earnings and profits of the first or receiving  corporation in the following cases: (1) No such increase shall be made  in respect of the part of such distribution which (under the law  applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) is directly  applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the  distribution was made and (2) no such increase shall be made if (under  the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) the  distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the  distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the  property received (or such basis would but for section 307(b) be so  allocated). Where, therefore, the law (applicable to the year in which  the distribution was made, as, for example, a distribution in 1934 from  earnings and profits accumulated before March 1, 1913) requires that the  amount of such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the  basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution was made,  there   is no increase in the earnings and profits by reason of the receipt of  such distribution. Similarly, where there is received by a corporation a  distribution from another corporation in the form of a stock dividend  and the law applicable to the year in which such distribution was made  requires the allocation, as between the old stock and the stock received  as a dividend, of the basis of the old stock (or such basis would but  for section 307(b) be so allocated), then there is no increase in the  earnings and profits by reason of the receipt of such stock dividend  even though such stock dividend constitutes income within the meaning of  the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The principles set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X in 1955 distributed to Corporation Y, one  of its shareholders, $10,000 which was out of earnings or profits  accumulated before March 1, 1913, and did not exceed the adjusted basis  of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made. This amount  of $10,000 was, therefore, a tax-free distribution and under the  provisions of section 301(c)(2) must be applied against and reduce the  adjusted basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was  made. The earnings and profits of Corporation Y are not increased by  reason of the receipt of this distribution.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation Z in 1955 had outstanding common and  preferred stock of which Corporation Y held 100 shares of the common and  no preferred. The stock had a cost basis to Corporation Y of $100 per  share, or a total cost of $10,000. In December of that year it received  a dividend of 100 shares of the preferred stock of Corporation Z. Such  distribution is a stock dividend which, under section 305, was not  taxable and was accordingly not included in the gross income of  Corporation Y. The original cost of $10,000 is allocated to the 200  shares of Corporation Z none of which has been sold or otherwise  disposed of by Corporation Y. See section 307 and Sec. 1.307-1. The  earnings and profits of Corporation Y are not increased by reason of the  receipt of such stock dividend.</p>
