                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HHS, with the advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and  Worker Health, has issued regulatory guidelines at 42 CFR part 81 that  OWCP uses to determine whether radiogenic cancers claimed under Parts B  and E were at least as likely as not related to employment at a DOE  facility, an atomic weapons employer facility, or a RECA section 5  facility, as appropriate. Persons should consult HHS's regulations for  information regarding the factual evidence that will be considered by  OWCP, in addition to the employee's radiation dose reconstruction that  will be provided to OWCP by HHS, in making this particular factual  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(A)</em> of the Act, since those regulations  provide the factual basis for OWCP to determine if ``it is at least as  likely as not'' that exposure to radiation at a DOE facility or RECA  section 5 facility, as appropriate, was a significant factor in  aggravating, contributing to, or causing the employee's radiogenic  cancer claimed under Part E. For cancer claims under Part E, if the PoC  is less   than 50% and the claimant alleges that the employee was exposed to  additional toxic substances, OWCP will determine if the claim is  otherwise compensable pursuant to Sec. 30.230(d) of this part.</p>
