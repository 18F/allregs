Every effort shall be made to narrow the issues in the answer. The defendant shall state concisely its defense to each claim asserted, admit or

deny the averments on which the complainant relies, and state in detail the basis for admitting or denying such averment. General denials are prohibited. Denials based on information and belief are expressly prohibited unless made in good faith and accompanied by an affidavit explaining the basis for the defendant's belief and why the defendant could not reasonably ascertain the facts from the complainant or any other source. If the defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the defendant shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. When a defendant intends in good faith to deny only part of an averment, the defendant shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. The defendant may deny the allegations of the complaint as specific denials of either designated averments or paragraphs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The answer shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set forth in the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Averments in a complaint or supplemental complaint filed pursuant to Secs. 14.38 and 14.39 of this subpart are deemed to be admitted when not denied in the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Affirmative defenses to allegations contained in the complaint shall be specifically captioned as such and presented separately from any denials made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The answer shall include an information designation containing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and position of each individual believed to have firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged with particularity in the answer, along with a description of the facts within any such individual's knowledge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible things in the defendant's possession, custody, or control, that are relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the answer. Such description shall include for each document:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date it was prepared, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise disseminated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The author, preparer, or other source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The recipient(s) or intended recipient(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Its physical location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A description of its relevance to the matters in dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A complete description of the manner in which the defendant identified all persons with information and designated all documents, data compilations and tangible things as being relevant to the dispute, including, but not limited to, identifying the individual(s) that conducted the information search and the criteria used to identify such persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The answer shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents, data compilations and tangible things in the defendant's possession, custody, or control, upon which the defendant relies or intends to rely to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The answer shall contain certification that the defendant has, in good faith, discussed or attempted to discuss, the possibility of settlement with the complainant prior to the filing of the formal complaint. Such certification shall include a brief summary of all steps taken to resolve the dispute prior to the filing of the formal complaint. If no such steps were taken, such certificate shall state the reason(s) why the defendant believed such steps would be fruitless;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The defendant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3 of this chapter, for a waiver of any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may be granted for good cause shown.</p>
