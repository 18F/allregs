                            <p class="depth0">An applicant or recipient of a business loan may request  reconsideration of a denied loan or loan modification request within 6  months of denial. Applicants denied due to a size determination can  appeal that determination under part 121 of this chapter. All others  must be submitted to the office that denied the original request. To  prevail, the applicant must demonstrate that it has overcome all  legitimate reasons for denial. Six months after denial, a new  application is required. If the reconsideration is denied, a second and  final reconsideration may be considered by the Director, Office of  Financial Assistance (D/FA), whose decision is final.</p><p class="depth0">Computerized SBA Forms</p>
