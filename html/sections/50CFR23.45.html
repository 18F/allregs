                                Sec.  23.45  What are the requirements for a pre-Convention specimen?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article VII(2) of the Treaty exempts a pre-Convention specimen from standard permitting requirements in Articles III, IV, and V of the Treaty when the exporting or re-exporting country is satisfied that the specimen was acquired before the provisions of CITES applied to it and issues a CITES document to that effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following general provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of pre-Convention documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trade in a specimen under the pre-Convention exemption is allowed only if the importing country will accept a pre-Convention certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pre-Convention date is the date the species was first listed under CITES regardless of whether the species has subsequently been transferred from one Appendix to another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a pre-Convention Appendix-I specimen, no CITES import permit is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The pre-Convention exemption does not apply to offspring or cell lines of any wildlife or plant born or propagated after the date the species was first listed under CITES.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. application form. Complete Form 3-200-23 (wildlife) or Form 3-200-32 (plants) and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign certificates. When applying for a U.S. certificate, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that the specimen meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specimen was removed from the wild or born or propagated in a controlled environment before the date CITES first applied to it, or is a product (including a manufactured item) or derivative made from such specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scientific name of the species is the standard nomenclature in the CITES Appendices or the references adopted by the CoP (see Sec.  23.23).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Live wildlife or plants will be prepared and shipped so as to minimize risk of injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the re-export of a pre-Convention specimen previously imported under a CITES document, the wildlife or plant was legally imported.</p>
