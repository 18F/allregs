                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Child; age 18. A child who is eligible for educational  assistance and who is also eligible for pension, compensation or  dependency and indemnity compensation based on school attendance   must elect whether he or she will receive educational assistance or  pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An election of educational assistance either before or after the  age of 18 years is a bar to subsequent payment or increased rates or  additional amounts of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity  compensation on account of the child based on school attendance on or  after the age of 18 years. The bar is equally applicable where the child  has eligibility from more than one parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity  compensation to or on account of a child after his or her 18th birthday  does not bar subsequent payments of educational assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An election of educational assistance will not preclude the  allowance of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity  compensation based on school attendance for periods, including vacation  periods, prior to the commencement of educational assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Child; under 18 or helpless. Educational assistance allowance or  special restorative training allowance may generally be paid  concurrently with pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity  compensation for a child under the age of 18 years or for a helpless  child based on the service of one or more parents. Where, however,  entitlement is based on the death of more than one parent in the same  parental line, concurrent payments in two or more cases may not be  authorized if the death of one such parent occurred on or after June 9,  1960. In the latter cases, an election of educational assistance and  pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in one  case does not preclude a reelection of benefits before attaining age 18  or while helpless based on the service of another parent in the same  parental line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Child; election. An election by a child under this section must  be submitted to VA in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an  election to receive Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance  (DEA) is final when the eligible child commences a program of education  under DEA (38 U.S.C. chapter 35). Commencement of a program of education  under DEA will be deemed to have occurred for VA purposes on the date  the first payment of DEA educational assistance is made, as evidenced by  negotiation of the first check or receipt of the first payment by  electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An election based on erroneous information furnished by an  authorized representative of the Department of Veterans Affairs is not  considered final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A child other than a helpless child, whose eligibility was based  on a finding that the veteran had a permanent total service-connected  disability and who commenced a program of education under DEA may not  thereafter qualify as a dependent for disability compensation purposes  if the veteran is later found to be less than permanently and totally  disabled, or for pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity  compensation after the veteran's death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Spouse or surviving spouse. Educational assistance allowance may  be paid for an eligible spouse or surviving spouse concurrently with  pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation.
