These employees are subject to separate reporting requirements under section 401 of Exective Order 11222.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special Government employees not required to submit statements. An agency head may waive the requirement of this section for the submission of a statement of employment and financial interest in the case of a special Government employee who is not a consultant or an expert when the agency finds that the duties of the position held by that special Government employee are of a nature and at such a level of responsibility that the submission of the statement by the incumbent is not necessary to protect the integrity of the Government. For the purpose of this paragraph, ``consultant'' and ``expert'' have the meanings given those terms by chapter 304 of the Federal Personnel Manual, but do not include a physician, dentist, or allied medical specialist whose services are procured to provide care and service to patients.</p>
