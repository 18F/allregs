A person shall not be  considered to be a part-time employee or part-time consultant for this  purpose unless the terms of his employment contemplate that he shall  work for less than the minimum number of hours per day, or less than a  minimum number of days per week, or less than the minimum number of  weeks per year, regularly required of full-time employees of his class.</p>
