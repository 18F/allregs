Safety relief valves  shall be set and adjusted by a competent person who is thoroughly  familiar with the construction and operation of the valve being set.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opening pressures. At least one safety relief valve shall be set  to open at a pressure not exceeding the MAWP. Safety relief valves shall  be set to open at pressures not exceeding 6 psi above the MAWP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Setting procedures. When setting safety relief valves, two steam  gauges shall be used, one of which must be so located that it will be in  full view of the persons engaged in setting such valves; and if the  pressure indicated by the gauges varies more than 3 psi they shall be  removed from the boiler, tested, and corrected before the safety relief  valves are set. Gauges shall in all cases be tested immediately before  the safety relief valves are set or any change made in the setting. When  setting safety relief valves, the water level shall not be higher than  \3/4\ of the length of the visible water glass, as measured from the  bottom of the glass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling of lowest set pressure. The set pressure of the lowest  safety relief valve shall be indicated on a tag or label attached to the  steam gauge so that it may be clearly read while observing the steam  gauge.</p>
