                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Negotiated grievance procedure (NGP) as exclusive administrative  remedy. If at any time during the claim period, a claimant was a member  of a bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement that  did not specifically exclude matters under the Act from the scope of the  NGP, the claimant must use that NGP as the exclusive administrative  remedy for all claims under the Act. There is no right to further  administrative review by the agency or by OPM. The remaining sections in  this subpart (that is, Sec. Sec. 551.704 through 551.710) do not apply  to such employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-NGP administrative review by agency or OPM. A claimant may  file a claim with the agency employing the   claimant during the claim period or with OPM, but not both  simultaneously, regarding matters arising under the Act if, during the  entire claim period, the claimant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was not a member of a bargaining unit, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was a member of a bargaining unit not covered by a collective  bargaining agreement, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Was a member of a bargaining unit covered by a collective  bargaining agreement that specifically excluded matters under the Act  from the scope of the NGP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Judicial review. Nothing in this subpart limits the right of a  claimant to bring an action in an appropriate United States court.  Filing a claim with an agency or with OPM does not satisfy the statute  of limitations governing FLSA claims filed in court. OPM will not decide  an FLSA claim that is in litigation.</p>
