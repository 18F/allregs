Exports of nuclear reactor components, as specified in paragraphs (5) through (11) of appendix A to this part, when exported separately from the items described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of appendix A to this part, are subject to the export licensing criteria in Sec. 110.42(b).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> IAEA safeguards as required by Article III (2) of the NPT will be applied with respect to any such facilities or material proposed to be exported, to any such material or facilities previously exported and subject to the applicable agreement for cooperation, and to any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No such material or facilities proposed to be exported or previously exported and subject to the applicable agreement for cooperation, and no special nuclear material produced through the use of such material or facilities, will be used for any nuclear explosive device or for research on or development of any nuclear explosive device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adequate physical security measures will be maintained with respect to such material or facilities proposed to be exported and to any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use thereof. Physical security measures will be deemed adequate if such measures provide a level of protection equivalent to that set forth in Sec. 110.44.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No such material or facilities proposed to be exported, and no special nuclear material produced through the use of such material, will be retransferred to the jurisdiction of any other country or group of countries unless the prior approval of the United States is obtained for such retransfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No such material proposed to be exported and no special nuclear material produced through the use of such

material will be reprocessed, and no irradiated fuel elements containing such material removed from a reactor will be altered in form or content, unless the prior approval of the United States is obtained for such reprocessing or alteration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> With respect to exports of such material or facilities to nonnuclear weapon states, IAEA safeguards will be maintained with respect to all peaceful activities in, under the jurisdiction of, or carried out under the control of such state at the time of export. This criterion will not be applied if the Commission has been notified by the President in writing that failure to approve an export because this criterion has not been met would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security, in which case the provisions of section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act regarding Congressional review will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The proposed export of a facility or of more than 0.003 effective kilograms of special nuclear material, other than plutonium containing 80 percent or more by weight of plutonium-238, would be under the terms of an agreement for cooperation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security and, in the case of facility exports, does not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, with respect to exports of high-enriched uranium to be used as a fuel or target in a nuclear research or test reactor, the Commission determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, with respect to exports of high-enriched uranium to be used as a fuel or target in a nuclear research or test reactor, the Commission determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target enriched to less than 20 percent in the isotope U-235 that can be used in that reactor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The proposed recipient of the uranium has provided assurances that, whenever an alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target can be used in that reactor, it will use that alternative fuel or target in lieu of highly-enriched uranium;
