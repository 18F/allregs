                            <p class="depth0">Except as allowed by this section, we may void the certificate of  any vehicle family certified to an FEL above the applicable standard for  which you do   not have sufficient credits by the deadline for submitting the final  report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your certificate for a vehicle family for which you do not have  sufficient CO2 credits will not be void if you remedy the  deficit with surplus credits within three model years. For example, if  you have a credit deficit of 500 Mg for a vehicle family at the end of  model year 2015, you must generate (or otherwise obtain) a surplus of at  least 500 Mg in that same averaging set by the end of model year 2018.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may apply only surplus credits to your deficit. You may not  apply credits to a deficit from an earlier model year if they were  generated in a model year for which any of your vehicle families for  that averaging set had an end-of-year credit deficit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you do not remedy the deficit with surplus credits within  three model years, we may void your certificate for that vehicle family.  Note that voiding a certificate applies ab initio. Where the net deficit  is less than the total amount of negative credits originally generated  by the family, we will void the certificate only with respect to the  number of vehicles needed to reach the amount of the net deficit. For  example, if the original vehicle family generated 500 Mg of negative  credits, and the manufacturer's net deficit after three years was 250  Mg, we would void the certificate with respect to half of the vehicles  in the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, the  following actions are all considered to occur at the expiration of the  deadline for offsetting debits as specified in paragraph (a) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failing to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate was  issued relative to offsetting debits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Selling, offering for sale, introducing or delivering into U.S.  commerce, or importing vehicles that are found not to be covered by a  certificate as a result of failing to offset debits.
