[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Suspension of Program Countries or Geographic Areas. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Suspension of a country or geographic area from the Guam-CNMI Visa  Waiver Program may be made on a country-by-country basis for good cause  including, but not limited to if: The admissions of visitors from a  country have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from a  country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the CNMI, unlawfully obtaining  entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking withholding of  removal or seeking asylum; or that visitors from a country pose a risk  to law enforcement or security interests, including the enforcement of  immigration laws of Guam, the CNMI, or the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A country or geographic area may be suspended from the Guam- CNMI Visa Waiver Program if that country or geographic area is  designated as a Country of Particular Concern under the International  Religious Freedom Act of 1998 by the Department of State, or identified  by the Department of State as a source country of refugees designated of  special humanitarian concern to the United States, pending an evaluation  and determination by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A country or geographic area may be suspended from the Guam- CNMI Visa Waiver Program by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in  consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of  State, based on the evaluation of all factors the Secretary deems  relevant including, but not limited to, electronic travel authorization,  procedures for reporting lost and stolen passports, repatriation of  aliens, rates of refusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit  systems and information exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Admission under this section renders an alien ineligible for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of the Act or as an immediate relative as  defined in section 201(b) of the Act, to that of a lawful permanent  resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change of nonimmigrant status; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Extension of stay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirements for transportation lines.

This ticket  must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Valid for a period of not less than one year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonrefundable except in the country in which issued or in the  country of the alien's nationality or residence, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Issued by a carrier which has entered into an agreement  described in paragraph (q)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transport an alien in possession of a completed and signed  Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Information Form (CBP Form I-736), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transport an alien in possession of completed I-94, Arrival- Departure Record (CBP Form I-94).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Bonding. The Secretary may require a bond on behalf of an alien  seeking admission under the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, in addition  to the requirements enumerated in this section, when the Secretary deems  it appropriate. Such bonds may be required of an individual alien or of  an identified subset of participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Maintenance of status--(i) Satisfactory departure. If an  emergency prevents an alien admitted under the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver  Program, as set forth in this paragraph (q), from departing from Guam or  the CNMI within his or her period of authorized stay, an immigration  officer having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's temporary stay  may, in his or her discretion, grant a period of satisfactory departure  not to exceed 15 days. If departure is accomplished during that period,  the alien is to be regarded as having satisfactorily accomplished the  visit without overstaying the allotted time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Inadmissibility and Deportability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determinations of  inadmissibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An alien who applies for admission under the  provisions of the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, who is determined by an  immigration officer to be inadmissible to Guam or the CNMI under one or  more of the grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 212 of the Act  (other than for lack of a visa), or who is in possession of and presents  fraudulent or counterfeit travel documents, will be refused admission  into Guam or the CNMI and removed. Such refusal and removal shall be  effected without referral of the alien to an immigration judge for  further inquiry, examination, or hearing, except that an alien who  presents himself or herself as an applicant for admission to Guam under  the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, who applies for asylum, withholding  of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the INA or withholding or deferral  of removal under the regulations implementing Article 3 of the United  Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment must be issued a Form I-863, Notice of Referral  to Immigration Judge, for a proceeding in accordance with 8 CFR  208.2(c)(1) and (2). The provisions of 8 CFR subpart 208 subpart A shall  not apply to an alien present or arriving in the CNMI seeking to apply  for asylum prior to January 1, 2015. No application for asylum may be  filed pursuant to section 208 of the Act by an alien present or arriving  in the CNMI prior to January 1, 2015; however, aliens physically present  in the CNMI during the transition period who express a fear of  persecution or torture only may establish eligibility for withholding of  removal pursuant to INA 241(b)(3) or pursuant to the regulations  implementing Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture  and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The removal of an alien under this section may be deferred if  the alien is paroled into the custody of a Federal, State, or local law  enforcement agency for criminal prosecution or punishment. This section  in no way diminishes the discretionary authority of the Secretary  enumerated in section 212(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Refusal of admission under this paragraph shall not constitute  removal for purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of deportability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An alien who has been  admitted to either Guam or the CNMI under the provisions of this section  who is determined by an immigration officer to be deportable from either  Guam or the CNMI under one or more of the grounds of deportability  listed in section 237 of the Act, shall be removed from either Guam or  the CNMI to his or her country of nationality or last residence. Such  removal will be determined by DHS authority that has jurisdiction over  the place where the alien is found, and will be effected without  referral of the alien to an immigration judge for a determination of  deportability, except that an alien admitted to Guam under the Guam-CNMI  Visa Waiver Program who applies for asylum or other form of protection  from persecution or torture must be issued a Form I-863 for a proceeding  in accordance with 8 CFR 208.2(c)(1) and (2). The provisions of 8 CFR  part 208 subpart A shall not apply to an alien present or arriving in  the CNMI seeking to apply for asylum   prior to January 1, 2015. No application for asylum may be filed  pursuant to section 208 of the INA by an alien present or arriving in  the CNMI prior to January 1, 2015; however, aliens physically present or  arriving in the CNMI prior to January 1, 2015, may apply for withholding  of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and withholding and  deferral of removal under the regulations implementing Article 3 of the  United Nations Convention Against Torture, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Removal by DHS under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is  equivalent in all respects and has the same consequences as removal  after proceedings conducted under section 240 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Removal of inadmissible aliens who arrived by air or sea.  Removal of an alien from Guam or the CNMI under this section may be  effected using the return portion of the round trip passage presented by  the alien at the time of entry to Guam and the CNMI. Such removal shall  be on the first available means of transportation to the alien's point  of embarkation to Guam or the CNMI. Nothing in this part absolves the  carrier of the responsibility to remove any inadmissible or deportable  alien at carrier expense, as provided in the carrier agreement.
