The refiner shall follow the procedures, applicable to  volume baselines and using motor vehicle diesel fuel instead of  gasoline, specified in Sec. Sec. 80.91 through 80.93 to establish the  volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that was produced for U.S. use in  1998 and 1999 for purposes of establishing a volume baseline under this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A letter signed by the president, chief operating, or chief  executive officer of the company, or his/her delegate, stating that the  information contained in the volume baseline determination is true to  the best of his/her knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name, address, phone number, facsimile number, and e-mail  address (if available) of a corporate contact person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following information for each batch of motor vehicle diesel  fuel produced for U.S. use in 1998 and 1999:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, or, if unavailable, such other  identifying information as is available; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Volume of the batch, in gallons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For a refinery that was not in operation during part or all of  the period 1998 and 1999, the information required under this paragraph  (c) for the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced for U.S. use during the  most recent calendar year that the refinery was in operation after the  refinery was reactivated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 120 days of receipt of an application under this section,  EPA will notify the refiner of an approval of the refinery's baseline,  or of any deficiencies in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If at any time the baseline submitted in accordance with the  requirements of this section is determined to be incorrect, EPA will  notify the refiner of the corrected baseline.
