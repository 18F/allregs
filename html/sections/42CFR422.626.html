                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enrollee's right to a fast-track appeal of an MA organization's  termination decision. An enrollee of an MA organization has a right to a  fast-track appeal of an MA organization's decision to terminate provider  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enrollee who desires a fast-track appeal must submit a  request for an appeal to an IRE under contract with CMS, in writing or  by telephone, by noon of the first day after the day of delivery of the  termination notice. If, due to an emergency, the IRE is closed and  unable to accept the enrollee's request for a fast-track appeal, the  enrollee must file a request by noon of the next day that the IRE is  open for business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an enrollee fails to make a timely request to an IRE, he or  she may request an expedited reconsideration by the MA organization as  described in Sec. 422.584.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, after delivery of the termination notice, an enrollee  chooses to leave a provider or discontinue receipt of covered services  on or before the proposed termination date, the enrollee may not later  assert fast-track IRE appeal rights under this section relative to the  services or expect the services to resume, even if the enrollee requests  an appeal before the discontinuation date in the termination notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coverage of provider services. Coverage of provider services  continues until the date and time designated on the termination notice,  unless the enrollee appeals and the IRE reverses the MA organization's  decision. If the IRE's decision is delayed because the MA organization  did not timely supply necessary information or records, the MA  organization is liable for the costs of any additional coverage required  by the delayed IRE decision. If the IRE finds that the enrollee did not  receive valid notice, coverage of provider services by the MA  organization continues until at least two days after valid notice has  been received. Continuation of coverage is not required if the IRE  determines that coverage could pose a threat to the enrollee's health or  safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Burden of proof. When an enrollee appeals an MA organization's  decision to terminate services to an IRE, the burden of proof rests with  the MA organization to demonstrate that termination of coverage is the  correct decision, either on the basis of medical necessity, or based on  other Medicare coverage policies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To meet this burden, the MA organization must supply any and all  information that an IRE requires to sustain the MA organization's  termination decision, consistent with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The enrollee may submit evidence to be considered by an IRE in  making its decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The MA organization or an IRE may require an enrollee to  authorize release to the IRE of his or her medical records, to the  extent that the records are necessary for the MA organization to  demonstrate the correctness of its decision or for an IRE to determine  the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures an IRE must follow. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the date an IRE receives  the enrollee's request for an appeal, the IRE must immediately notify  the MA organization and the provider that the enrollee has filed a  request for a fast-track appeal, and of the MA organization's  responsibility to submit documentation consistent with paragraph (e)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an enrollee requests a fast-track appeal, the IRE must  determine whether the provider delivered a valid notice of the  termination decision, and whether a detailed notice has been provided,  consistent with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The IRE must notify CMS about each case in which it determines  that improper notification occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before making its decision, the IRE must solicit the enrollee's  views regarding the reason(s) for termination of services as specified  in the detailed written notice provided by the MA organization, or  regarding any other reason that the IRE uses as the basis of its review  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An IRE must make a decision on an appeal and notify the  enrollee, the MA organization, and the provider of services, by close of  business of the day after it receives the information necessary to make  the decision. If the IRE does not receive the information needed to  sustain an MA organization's decision to terminate services, it may make  a decision on the case based on the information at hand, or it may defer  its decision until it receives the necessary information. If the IRE  defers its decision, coverage of the services by the MA organization  would continue until the decision is made, consistent with paragraph (b)  of this section, but no additional termination notice would be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Responsibilities of the MA organization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an IRE  notifies an MA organization that an enrollee has requested a fast-track  appeal, the MA organization must send a detailed notice to the enrollee  by close of business of the day of the IRE's notification. The detailed  termination notice must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A specific and detailed explanation why services are either no  longer reasonable and necessary or are no longer covered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of any applicable Medicare coverage rule,  instruction or other Medicare policy including citations, to the  applicable Medicare policy rules, or the information about how the  enrollee may obtain a copy of the Medicare policy from the MA  organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any applicable MA organization policy, contract provision, or  rationale upon which the termination decision was based.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Facts specific to the enrollee and relevant to the coverage  determination that are sufficient to advise the enrollee of the  applicability of the coverage rule or policy to the enrollee's case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other information required by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon an enrollee's request, the MA organization must provide the  enrollee a copy of, or access to, any documentation sent to the IRE by  the MA organization, including records of any information provided by  telephone. The MA organization may charge the enrollee a reasonable  amount to cover the costs of duplicating the information for the  enrollee and/or delivering the documentation to the enrollee. The MA  organization must accommodate such a request by no later than close of  business of the first day after the day the material is requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon notification by the IRE of a fast-track appeal, the MA  organization must supply any and all information, including a copy of  the notice sent to   the enrollee, that the IRE needs to decide on the appeal. The MA  organization must supply this information as soon as possible, but no  later than by close of business of the day that the IRE notifies the MA  organization that an appeal has been received from the enrollee. The MA  organization must make the information available by phone (with a  written record made of what is transmitted in this manner) and/or in  writing, as determined by the IRE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An MA organization is financially responsible for coverage of  services as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of  whether it has delegated responsibility for authorizing coverage or  termination decisions to its providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Responsibilities of the provider. If an IRE reverses an MA  organization's termination decision, the provider must provide the  enrollee with a new notice consistent with Sec. 422.624(b) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reconsiderations of IRE decisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the IRE upholds an MA  organization's termination decision in whole or in part, the enrollee  may request, no later than 60 days after notification that the IRE has  upheld the decision that the IRE reconsider its original decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IRE must issue its reconsidered determination as  expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires but no later  than within 14 days of receipt of the enrollee's request for a  reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the IRE reaffirms its decision, in whole or in part, the  enrollee may appeal the IRE's reconsidered determination to an ALJ, the  MAC, or a Federal court, as provided for under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If on reconsideration the IRE determines that coverage of  provider services should terminate on a given date, the enrollee is  liable for the costs of continued services after that date unless the  IRE's decision is reversed on appeal. If the IRE's decision is reversed  on appeal, the MA organization must reimburse the enrollee, consistent  with the appealed decision, for the costs of any covered services for  which the enrollee has already paid the MA organization or provider.
