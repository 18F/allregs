An importer  shall certify that the importer will import less than and including  1,000 bushels of grain sorghum or 5,000 tons of sorghum forage, sorghum  hay, sorghum haylage, sorghum billets, or sorghum silage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of an application, the Board shall determine  whether an exemption may be granted. The Board then will issue, if  deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person who is  eligible to receive one. It is the responsibility of these persons to  retain a copy of the certificate of exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Importers who receive a certificate of exemption shall be  eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by Customs. These  importers shall apply to the Board for reimbursement of any assessments  paid. No interest will be paid on the assessments collected by Customs.  Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted to the Board within 90  days of the last day of the calendar year the sorghum was actually  imported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any person who desires an exemption from assessments for a  subsequent calendar year shall reapply to the Board, on a form provided  by the Board, for a certificate of exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Board may require persons receiving an exemption from  assessments to provide to the Board reports on the disposition of exempt  sorghum and, in the case of importers, proof of payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A producer or importer who operates under an approved National  Organic Program (NOP) (7 CFR part 205) system plan; produces or imports  only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic  under the NOP, except as provided for in paragraph (m) of this section;  and is not, or does not import products from, a split operation shall be  exempt from the payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To apply for an exemption under this section, the applicant  shall submit the request to the Board or other party as designated by  the Board, on a form provided by the Board, at any time initially and  annually thereafter on or before January 1 as long as the applicant  continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The request shall include the following: The applicant's name  and address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation  certificate provided by a USDA accredited certifying agent as defined in  section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C.  6502), a signed certification that the applicant meets all of the  requirements specified for an assessment exemption, and such other  information as may be required by the Board and with the approval of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the applicant complies with the requirements of this section,  the Board or designee will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate  of Exemption to the applicant.

Reasons  for conventional sales include lack of demand for organic products,  isolated use of antibiotics for humane purposes, chemical or pesticide  use as the result of State or emergency spray programs, and crops from a  buffer area as described in   7 CFR part 205, provided all other criteria are met.</p>
