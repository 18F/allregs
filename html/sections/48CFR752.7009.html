This guidance will be provided through the cognizant technical office  indicated on the cover page of this contract, or by the Mission Director  in the Cooperating Country to which commodities are being shipped, or in  which the project site is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority to waive marking requirements is vested with the  Regional Assistant Administrators, and with Mission Directors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A copy of any specific marking instructions or waivers from  marking requirements is to be sent to the contracting officer; the  original should be retained by the Contractor.
