                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If DOE has administrative discretion in the selection of the  award instrument, the DOE decision as to whether the relationship is  principally one of procurement or financial assistance shall be made  pursuant to the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act as codified  at 31 U.S.C. 6301-6306. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be the  appropriate instrument, in accordance with this part, when the principal  purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money or property to  accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by  Federal statute. In selecting the type of financial assistance  instrument, DOE shall limit involvement between itself and the recipient  in the performance of a project to the minimum necessary to achieve DOE  program objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When it is anticipated that substantial involvement will be  necessary between DOE and the recipient during performance of the  contemplated activity, the award instrument shall be a cooperative  agreement rather than a grant. Every cooperative agreement shall  explicitly state the substantial involvement anticipated between DOE and  the recipient during the performance of the project. Substantial  involvement exists if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Responsibility for the management, control, or direction of the  project is shared by DOE and the recipient; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responsibility for the performance of the project is shared by  DOE and the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Providing technical assistance or guidance of a programmatic  nature to a recipient does not constitute substantial involvement if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> the recipient is not required to follow such guidance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> the technical assistance or guidance is not expected to result  in continuing DOE involvement in the performance of the project; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The technical assistance or guidance pertains solely to the  administrative requirements of the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cooperative agreements, DOE has the right to intervene in the  conduct or performance of project activities for programmatic reasons.  Intervention includes the interruption or modification of the conduct or  performance of project activities. Suspension or termination of the  cooperative agreement under Secs. 600.162, 600.243 and 600.352 does not  constitute intervention in the conduct or performance of project  activities.
