                                Sec. 2812.3  Right-of-way and road use agreement.

Sec. 2812.3-1  Rights over lands controlled by applicant.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Where, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it appears necessary in order to carry out the policy set forth in Sec. 2812.0-6, he may require the applicant, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the permit:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To grant to the United States, for use by it and its licensees and permittees, rights-of-way across lands in the O. and C. area directly controlled by the applicant; and as to lands in such area which are indirectly controlled by him, either to obtain such rights for the United States or to make a showing satisfactory to the authorized officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and to waive as to the United States, its licensees and permittees any exclusive or restricted right he may have to such lands as are indirectly controlled by him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, to agree to permit the United States and its licensees, upon the payment of fair compensation as hereinafter provided, to use under the terms and conditions of this paragraph such portion as the applicant directly controls of the road system and rights-of-way which are an integral part of or may be added to the road system with which the right-of-way applied for will connect, and as to the portions of such road system or rights-of-way as the applicant indirectly controls, either to obtain such rights for the United States and its licensees or to make a showing satisfactory to the authorized officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and, in such latter circumstance, to waive as to the United States and its licensees any exclusive or restricted right he may have in such portion of the road system and rights-of-way.


Sec. 2812.3-2  Other roads and rights-of-way controlled by applicant.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the private road systems and rights-of-way described in Sec. 2812.3-1 in the event the applicant controls directly or indirectly other roads or rights-of-way in any O. and C. area where the authorized officer of the

Bureau finds that, as of the time of filing or during the pendency of the application, the United States is unreasonably denied access to its timber for management purposes or where, as of such time, competitive bidding by all prospective purchasers of timber managed by the Bureau in the O. and C. area, or of other Federal timber intermingled with or adjacent to such timber, is substantially precluded by reason of the applicant's control, direct or indirect, of such roads or rights-of-way, the authorized officer may require the applicant to negotiate an agreement granting to the United States and its licensees the right to use, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this paragraph such portion of such roads or rights-of-way as may be necessary to accommodate such management or competitive bidding.


Sec. 2812.3-3  Form of grant to the United States, recordation.</p><p class="depth0">Any grant of rights to the United States under this section shall be executed on a form prescribed by the Director which shall constitute and form a part of any permit issued upon the application involved. The applicant shall record such agreement in the office of land records of the county or counties in which the roads, rights-of-way, or lands, subject to the agreement are located, and submit evidence of such recordation to the appropriate district manager.


Sec. 2812.3-4  Where no road use agreement is required.</p><p class="depth0">Where, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it is consistent with the policy set forth in subpart 2811 he may issue a permit without requesting the applicant to grant any rights to the United States under this paragraph.


Sec. 2812.3-5  Use by the United States and its licensees of rights received from a permittee.</p><p class="depth0">The use by the United States and its licensees of any of the rights received from a permittee hereunder shall be limited to that which is necessary for management purposes, or to reach, by the most reasonably direct route, involving the shortest practicable use of the permittee's road system, a road or highway which is suitable for the transportation of forest products in the type and size of vehicle customarily used for such purposes and which is legally available for public use for ingress to and the removal of forest products from Government lands or from other lands during such periods of time as the timber thereon may be committed by a cooperative agreement to coordinated administration with timber of the United States. However, the type and size of vehicle which may be used by the licensee on the permittee's road shall be governed by Sec. Sec. 2812.3-7 and 2812.4-3.


Sec. 2812.3-6  Duration and location of rights granted or received by the United States.</p><p class="depth0">The rights-of-way granted by the United States under any permit issued under Sec. 2812.6, subject to the provisions of Sec. 2812.7, will be for a stated term or terms which may vary for each portion of the right-of-way granted; such term or terms will normally be coincident with the probable period of use for the removal of forest products by the permittee and any successor in interest of the various portions of the right-of-way requested. In the same manner the permit will also state the duration of the rights of the United States to use and to permit its licensees to use, and the location by legal subdivisions of, each of the various portions, if any, of the roads, rights-of-way, and lands which a permittee hereunder authorizes the United States and its licensees to use; and, similarly, the duration of such rights received by the United States will normally be coincident with the probable period of use for the removal of forest products, by the United States and its existing and prospective licensees, of such roads, rights-of-way, and lands.


Sec. 2812.3-7  Permittee's agreement with United States respecting compensation and adjustment of road use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the United States receives rights over any road, right-of-way, or lands, controlled directly or indirectly by a permittee, the authorized officer will seek to arrive at an advance agreement with the permittee respecting any or all of such matters as the time,

route, and specifications for the development of the road system in the area; the total volume of timber to be moved over such road system, and the proportion of such timber which belongs to the United States or is embraced in a cooperative agreement for coordinated management with timber of the United States managed by the Bureau; the consequent proportion of the capital costs of the road system to be borne by such timber of the United States or embraced in such cooperative agreement; the period of time over, or rate at which, the United States or its licensees shall be required to amortise such capital cost; provisions for road maintenance; the use in addition to the uses set forth in Sec. 2812.3-5 which the United States and its licensees may make of the road system involved, a formula for determining the proportionate capacity of the road system or portions thereof which shall be available to the United States and its licensees for the transportation of forest products; the amount and type of insurance to be carried, and the type of security to be furnished by licensees of the United States who use such road; and such other similar matters as the authorized officer may deem appropriate. To the extent necessary to fulfill the obligations of the United States under any such advance agreement, subsequent contracts for the sale of timber managed by the Bureau and tapped by such road system, and subsequent cooperative agreements for the coordinated management of such timber with other timber, will contain such provisions as may be necessary or appropriate to require such licensees to comply with the terms of the advance agreement. Where such an advance agreement between the United States and the permittee includes provisions relating to the route and specifications for extensions of the road system involved, the authorized officer may agree that upon the filing of proper applications in the future the applicant or his successor in interest shall receive the necessary permits for such road extensions as may cross lands managed by the Bureau: Provided, however, That the applicant shall have substantially complied with the terms of such advance agreement and of the outstanding permits theretofore issued to him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of Sec. 2812.4 shall not be applicable to any matters embraced in an agreement made pursuant to this section.</p>
