There are no fugitive emissions  from a total enclosure. The only openings in a total enclosure are  forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such  as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for  processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine  operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such  doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are  acceptable, but if such openings are routine or if an access door  remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be  considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity  across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated  including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be  part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that meets the  requirements found in Sec.  63.705(c)(4)(i) is a total enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Utilize means the use of HAP that is delivered to mix preparation  equipment for the purpose of formulating coatings, the use of any other  HAP (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the  manufacturing process, and the use of any HAP for cleaning activities.  Alternatively, annual HAP utilization can be determined as net usage;  that is, the HAP inventory at the beginning of a 12-month period, plus  the amount of HAP purchased during the 12-month period, minus the amount  of HAP in inventory at the end of a 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0">Vacuum injection system means a system in which a vacuum draws  particulate from a storage container into a closed system that transfers  particulates into the mix preparation equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any organic compound that  participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that is measured  by EPA Test Methods 18, 24, or 25A in appendix A of part 60 or an  alternative test method as defined in Sec.  63.2.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration means  the concentration of an individually-speciated organic HAP in a  wastewater discharge that is measured by Method 305 of appendix A to 40  CFR part 63.</p><p class="depth0">Waste handling means processing or treatment of waste (liquid or  solid) that is generated as a by-product of either the magnetic tape  production process or cleaning operations.</p><p class="depth0">Waste handling device means equipment that is used to separate  solvent from solid waste (e.g., filter dryers) or liquid waste (e.g.,  pot stills and thin film evaporators).
