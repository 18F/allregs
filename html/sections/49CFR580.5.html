                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each title, at the time it is issued to the transferee, must contain the mileage disclosed by the transferor when ownership of the vehicle was transferred and contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section at the time of future transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any documents which are used to reassign a title shall contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section at the time of transfer of ownership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, each transferor shall disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title or, except as noted below, on the document being used to reassign the title. In the case of a transferor in whose name the vehicle is titled, the transferor shall disclose the mileage on the title, and not on a reassignment document. This written disclosure must be signed by the transferor, including the printed name. In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle in which more than one person is a transferor, only one transferor need sign the written disclosure. In addition to the signature and printed name of the transferor, the written disclosure must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The odometer reading at the time of transfer (not to include tenths of miles);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of transfer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transferor's name and current address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transferee's name and current address; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model, year, and body type, and its vehicle identification number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the information provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the statement shall refer to the Federal law and shall state that failure to complete or providing false information may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferor shall certify that to the best of his knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage, or;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, he shall include a statement to that effect; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the mileage and that the difference is greater than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading does not reflect the actual mileage, and should not be relied upon. This statement shall also include a warning notice to alert the transferee that a discrepancy exists between the odometer reading and the actual mileage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The transferee shall sign the disclosure statement, print his name, and return a copy to his transferor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the vehicle has not been titled or if the title does not contain a space for the information required, the written disclosure shall be executed as a separate document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No person shall sign an odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction, unless permitted by Sec. Sec. 580.13 or 580.14.
