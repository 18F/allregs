GAO will not consider a request for reconsideration that does not contain a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not previously considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for reconsideration of a bid protest decision shall be filed, with copies to the parties who participated in the protest, not later than 10 days after the basis for reconsideration is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> GAO will summarily dismiss any request for reconsideration that fails to state a valid basis for reconsideration or is untimely. To obtain reconsideration, the requesting party must show that our prior decision contains errors of either fact or law, or must present information not previously considered that warrants reversal or modification of our decision; GAO will not consider a request for reconsideration based on repetition of arguments previously raised.
