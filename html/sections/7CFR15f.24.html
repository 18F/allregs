The ALJ may recommend  dismissal of your complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not an  eligible complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint on the  merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your eligible  complaint and recommend to award you such relief as would be afforded  under the applicable statute or regulation under which the eligible  complaint was filed. The proposed determination will become the final  determination 35 days after it is made, unless you request review of the  proposed determination by the ASCR. The ASCR also may review the  proposed determination on his or her own initiative. If the ASCR reviews  the proposed determination, he or she will allow the parties a  reasonable opportunity to file briefs in support or opposition to the  proposed determination, and afterwards file a final determination within  35 days after you request review of the proposed determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, a final determination will be  filed within 180 days after you filed your Section 741 Complaint  Request.
