                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this part is to establish a method to adjust for inflation the civil monetary penalties provided by law within the jurisdiction of the Board. These penalties shall be subject to review and adjustment at least once every four years using the method specified in the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, as it amends the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410, 104 Stat. 890 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. 2461 note). The inflation adjustment is calculated by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalty amount per violation by the Cost-of-Living Adjustment, which is the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index for June of the year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for June of the year the civil monetary penalty amount was last set or adjusted, multiplied by the statutory maximum amount, rounded to the nearest specified amount using the formula contained in the statute. The initial adjustment, however, is capped at 10% of the penalty, regardless of the applicable rate of inflation.</p>
