This procedure allows institution staff to forward  with the application the necessary supplemental information (for  example, sentencing information, presentence report, progress report,  pertinent medical records if the petition involves the inmate's health,  etc.). Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no Bureau of  Prisons recommendation is to be forwarded with the package of material  submitted to the U.S. Pardon Attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When specifically requested by the U.S. Pardon Attorney, the  Director, Bureau of Prisons shall submit a recommendation on the  petition. Prior to making a recommendation, the Director may request  comments from the Warden at the institution where the inmate is  confined. Upon review of those comments, the Director will forward a  recommendation on the petition to the U.S. Pardon Attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a petition for commutation of sentence is granted by the  President of the United States, the U.S. Pardon Attorney will forward  the original of the signed and sealed warrant of clemency evidencing the  President's action to the Warden at the detaining institution, with a  copy to the Director, Bureau of Prisons. The Warden shall deliver the  original warrant to the affected inmate, and obtain a signed receipt for  return to the U.S. Pardon Attorney. The Warden shall take such action as  is indicated in the warrant of clemency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a petition for commutation of sentence is granted, Bureau of  Prisons staff shall recalculate the inmate's sentence in accordance with  the terms of the commutation order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the commutation grants parole eligibility, the inmate is to  be placed on the appropriate parole docket.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a petition for commutation of sentence is denied, the U.S.  Pardon Attorney ordinarily notifies the Warden, requesting that the  Warden notify the inmate of the denial.
