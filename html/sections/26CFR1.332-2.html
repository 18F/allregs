                                Sec. 1.332-2  Requirements for nonrecognition of gain or loss.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The nonrecognition of gain or loss is limited to the receipt of  such property by a corporation which is the actual owner of stock (in  the liquidating corporation) possessing at least 80 percent of the total  combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and the  owner of at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other  classes of stock (except nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred  as to dividends). The recipient corporation must have been the owner of  the specified amount of such stock on the date of the adoption of the  plan of liquidation and have continued so to be at all times until the  receipt of the property. If the recipient corporation does not continue  qualified with respect to the ownership of stock of the liquidating  corporation and if the failure to continue qualified occurs at any time  prior to the completion of the transfer of all the property, the  provisions for the nonrecognition of gain or loss do not apply to any  distribution received under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 332 applies only to those cases in which the recipient  corporation receives at least partial payment for the stock which it  owns in the liquidating corporation. If section 332 is not applicable,  see section 165(g) relative to allowance of losses on worthless  securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To constitute a distribution in complete liquidation within the  meaning of section 332, the distribution must be (1) made by the  liquidating corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all of  its stock in accordance with a plan of liquidation, or (2) one of a  series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all  its stock in accordance with a plan of liquidation. Where there is more  than one distribution, it is essential that a status of liquidation  exist at the time the first distribution is made under the plan and that  such status continue until the liquidation is completed. Liquidation is  completed when the liquidating corporation and the receiver or trustees  in liquidation are finally divested of all the property (both tangible  and intangible). A status of liquidation exists when the corporation  ceases to be a going concern and its activities are merely for the  purpose of winding up its affairs, paying its debts, and distributing  any remaining balance to its shareholders. A liquidation may be  completed prior to the actual dissolution of the liquidating  corporation. However, legal dissolution of the corporation is not  required. Nor will the mere retention of a nominal amount of assets for  the sole purpose of preserving the corporation's legal existence  disqualify the transaction. (See 26 CFR (1939) 39.22(a)-20 (Regulations  118).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a transaction constitutes a distribution in complete  liquidation within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and  satisfies the requirements of section 332, it is not material that it is  otherwise described under the local law. If a liquidating corporation  distributes all of its property in complete liquidation and if pursuant  to the plan for such complete liquidation a corporation owning the  specified amount of stock in the liquidating corporation receives  property constituting amounts distributed in complete liquidation within  the meaning of the Code and also receives other property attributable to  shares not owned by it, the transfer of the property to the recipient  corporation shall not be treated, by reason of the receipt of such other  property, as not being a distribution (or one of a series of  distributions) in complete cancellation or redemption of all of the  stock of the liquidating corporation within the meaning of section 332,  even though for purposes of those provisions relating to corporate  reorganizations the amount received by the recipient corporation in  excess of its ratable share is regarded as acquired upon the issuance of  its stock or securities in a tax-free exchange as described in section  361 and the cancellation or redemption of the stock not owned by the  recipient corporation is treated as occurring as a result of a taxfree  exchange described in section 354.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The application of these rules may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. On September 1, 1954, the M Corporation had outstanding  capital stock consisting of 3,000 shares of common stock, par   value $100 a share, and 1,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $100  a share, which preferred stock was limited and preferred as to dividends  and had no voting rights. On that date, and thereafter until the date of  dissolution of the M Corporation, the O Corporation owned 2,500 shares  of common stock of the M Corporation. By statutory merger consummated on  October 1, 1954, pursuant to a plan of liquidation adopted on September  1, 1954, the M Corporation was merged into the O Corporation, the O  Corporation under the plan issuing stock which was received by the other  holders of the stock of the M Corporation. The receipt by the O  Corporation of the properties of the M Corporation is a distribution  received by the O Corporation in complete liquidation of the M  Corporation within the meaning of section 332, and no gain or loss is  recognized as the result of the receipt of such properties.</p>
