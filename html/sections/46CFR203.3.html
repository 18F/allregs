Although persons seeking intervention need not call at the same specific ports proposed by the applicant by direct vessel calls, any filing based on intermodal service in opposition to an application shall demonstrate that such person regularly competes by intermodal service for cargo moving to or from ports in the service proposed by the applicant. The burden of demonstrating competition between the vessels of the person seeking intervention and those of the applicant will be with the person seeking such intervention. Leave to intervene will not be granted to those conducting a competing service on an intermittent or de minimis basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Leave to intervene in opposition to applications under section 605(c) of the Act will only be granted to operators of U.S.-flag vessels, and only to the extent, as demonstrated by the petition for leave to intervene, that such person provides an existing service, or that such person has firm and definite plans to provide a service, by a showing that its vessels operate in the same trade or on the same trade route as that proposed by the applicant and so operate in a manner competitive with the specific service proposed by the applicant.
