                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provision of broadband service is vital to the economic development, education, health, and safety of rural Americans. The purpose of the Community Connect Grant Program is to provide financial assistance in the form of grants to eligible applicants that will provide, on a ``community-oriented connectivity'' basis, broadband service that fosters economic growth and delivers enhanced educational, health care, and public safety benefits. The Agency will give priority to rural areas that have the greatest need for broadband services, based on the criteria contained herein and in the Notice of Funds Availability (hereinafter referred to as NOFA) published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant authority will be used for the deployment of service to all premises in eligible rural areas at the Broadband Grant Speed on a ``community-oriented connectivity'' basis. In addition to providing service to all premises the ``community-oriented connectivity'' concept will stimulate practical, everyday uses and applications of broadband by cultivating the deployment of new broadband services that improve economic development and provide enhanced educational and health care opportunities in rural areas. Such an approach will also give rural communities the opportunity to benefit from the advanced technologies that are necessary to achieve these goals.</p>
