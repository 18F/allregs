The amount that may  be deducted pursuant to section 162 and these regulations is an amount  equal to the product of the number of Congressional days in the taxable  year, multiplied by the designated amount. The designated amount is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a Member who deducts interest and taxes  attributable to the ownership of a personal residence in the Washington,  DC area, two-thirds of the maximum amount of actual subsistence for  Washington, DC payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5702(c), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Member, who lives in a residence owned by him in the  Washington, DC area, chooses to deduct amounts prescribed in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, the Member must treat as an adjustment to the  basis of such residence an amount equal to 20 percent of the maximum  amount of actual subsistence multiplied by the number of Congressional  days. Such adjustments will be considered a proper adjustment for  exhaustion, wear, and tear under this subtitle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Congressional days. The number of Congressional days with  respect to a Member is the number of days in the taxable year less the  number of days in periods in which the Member's Congressional chamber  was not in session for 5 consecutive days or more (including Saturday  and Sunday).

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16OC91.000</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other deductible amounts. This section does not preclude the  deduction of otherwise allowable expenses for travel fares (other than  local travel in the Washington, DC), long distance telephone and  telegraph, and travel expenses incurred other than in the Washington, DC  area. However, such   expenses are subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Election.

This section is effective for taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1980.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The following examples are based on a calendar from a  Final Edition of the Calendar of the United States, House of  Representatives and History of Legislation. The marked days indicate  days the House of Representatives was in session.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In determining the number of Congressional days for 198X  for which the designated amount may be computed, the number of days in  such year is reduced by 125 days determined as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Days ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Feb. 14-18.....................................................        5 Apr. 3-14......................................................       12 May 23-27......................................................        5 July 3-20......................................................       18 Aug. 2-17......................................................       16 Aug. 29-Sept. 2................................................        5 Oct. 3-Nov. 11.................................................       40 Nov. 22-Nov. 30................................................        9 Dec. 17-Dec. 31................................................       15</p><p class="depth2">--------</p><p class="depth2">Total......................................................      125 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thus for 198X (a leap year) a typical Member of the House of  Representatives will have 241 (366-125) Congressional days.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. On August 1, Z a calendar year taxpayer is elected to the  Congress to fill the unexpired term of Member Y. In determining the  number of Congressional days, Z may only consider the number of days  during the year for which he was a Member of Congress. For Z the number  of Congressional days is 68.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Member X, a calendar year taxpayer, owns his own home in  Washington, DC, where he lives with his family. While in Washington, DC,  Member X is away from home within the meaning of section 162(a). X  maintains no records attributable to his expenses in Washington, DC X  has been a Member of Congress for the entire year. The maximum amount of  subsistence for Washington, DC for 198X is $75. X may deduct for 198X  $18,075 (241 daysx$75) attributable to expenses while away from home in  Washington, DC. Even if X maintained records as to living expenses in  Washington, DC, X may choose to deduct $18,075 as the total amount  attributable to living expenses in Washington, DC. If X deducts $18,075  X may not deduct any interest and taxes under section 163 or 164  attributable to the residence in Washington, DC.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Member C, a calendar year taxpayer owns his own home in  Washington, DC, where he lives with his family. While in Washington, DC.  Member C is away from home within the meaning of section 162(a). C can  establish that he paid $12,000 as interest on a mortgage and $3,000 in  local real estate taxes. C has been a Member of Congress for the entire  year. C may choose to deduct $12,050 (241 daysx[\2/3\x$75]) attributable  to expenses in Washington, DC. Further, C may deduct under sections 163  and 164 $12,000 of interest and $3,000 of taxes respectively.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4). In addition, on  March 15, 16, and 17, Member C travels to New York City to deliver a  speech for which he receives an honorarium which he includes in income.  C receives no additional amounts for travel reimbursement. While in New  York City C incurs $350 for 3 nights lodging at a hotel and $150 for  meals. In addition to the amounts deductible pursuant to this section, C  may deduct the $500 as a travel expenses. Such deduction is subject to  the substantiation rules of section 274.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Assume the same facts as example (5). Member C receives,  in addition to the honorarium, $600 reimbursement for travel expenses. C  must include the $600 in income and may deduct the travel expenses he  incurred.
