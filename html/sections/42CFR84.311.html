Registration will enable NIOSH, which approved this model of respirator, to attempt to notify you if a problem is discovered that might affect the safety or performance of this respirator. Registration will also assist NIOSH in locating deployed units to periodically evaluate whether this respirator model is remaining effective under field conditions of storage and use.''
