                            <p class="depth0">If you receive a NARA final determination denying your request to  amend a record, you may file a Statement of Disagreement with the  appropriate system manager. The Statement of Disagreement must include  an explanation of why you believe the record to be inaccurate,  irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The system manager will maintain  your Statement of Disagreement in conjunction with the pertinent record.  The System Manager will send a copy of the Statement of Disagreement to  any person or agency to whom the record has been disclosed, only if the  disclosure was subject to the accounting requirements of Sec. 1202.60.</p>
