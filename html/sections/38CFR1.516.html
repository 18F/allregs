                                Sec.  1.516  Disclosure of information to undertaker concerning burial
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When an undertaker requests information believed to be necessary in  connection with the burial of a deceased veteran, such as the name and  address of the beneficiary of the veteran's Government insurance policy,  name and address of the next of kin, rank or grade of veteran and  organization in which he or she served, character of the veteran's  discharge, or date and place of birth of the veteran, and it appears  that the undertaker is holding the body awaiting receipt of the  information requested, the undertaker, in such instances, may be  considered the duly authorized representative of the deceased veteran  for the purpose of obtaining said information. In ordinary cases,  however, the undertaker will be advised that information concerning the  beneficiary of a Government insurance policy is confidential and cannot  be disclosed; the beneficiary will be advised immediately of the  inquiry, and the furnishing of the desired information will be  discretionary with the beneficiary. In no case will the undertaker be  informed of the net amount due under the policy or furnished information  not specifically mentioned in this paragraph.  [46 FR 62059, Dec. 22, 1981]</p>
