                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The amount of the DRC depends on--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The year the employee reaches full retirement age; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of months for which the credit is due, as explained in Sec. 225.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The percent given in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is multiplied by the PIA; that product is then multiplied by the number of months for which credit is due and rounded to the next lowest multiple of $0.10, if the answer is not already a multiple of $0.10. The result is the DRC which is added to the PIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employee attained age 65 before 1982.

Therefore, depending on when the employee attains age 65, the DRC percent will be as follows:

The rate of the DRC (one-fourth of one percent) is increased by one-twenty-fourth of one percent in each even year through 2008.

Mr. Jones stopped working on December 31, 1985, and applied for his annuity to begin January 1, 1986. Based on his earnings, his PIA was $350.50. Since Mr. Jones did not receive an annuity for the 12 months from the month in which he became 65 (January 1985) until the month following the month he stopped working (January 1986), he is due credit for each of those 12 months. The total amount of his DRC's is calculated as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Unrounded            Total amount</p><p class="depth2">Percent                    PIA                 No. of months               result                of DRC's----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">.25%          X         350.50         X           12           =         10.51         =       $10.50----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Jones' PIA increase for DRC's is $361.00 (350.50 + 10.50).
