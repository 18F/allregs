                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and authority. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)  is an independent agency of the Federal Government. Division A of the  Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110-289, 122 Stat.  2654, titled the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008,  amended the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness  Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (Safety and Soundness Act) and the  Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1421-1449) to establish FHFA. FHFA  administers the Safety and Soundness Act and the regulated entities'  authorizing statutes: the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, the Federal  National Mortgage Association Charter Act, and the Federal Home Loan  Mortgage Corporation Act. FHFA is responsible for the supervision and  regulation of the Federal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae),  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), (together,  Enterprises), the Federal Home Loan Banks (Banks) (collectively, the  ``regulated entities''), and the Office of Finance (OF). FHFA is charged  with ensuring that the regulated entities: Operate in a safe and sound  manner, including maintaining adequate capital and internal controls;  foster liquid, efficient, competitive, and resilient national housing  finance markets; comply with the Safety and Soundness Act and their  respective authorizing statutes, and rules, regulations and orders  issued under the Safety and Soundness Act and the authorizing statutes;  and carry out their respective statutory missions through activities and  operations that are authorized and consistent with the Safety and  Soundness Act, their respective authorizing statutes, and the public  interest. FHFA's costs and expenses are funded by annual assessments  paid by the regulated entities. FHFA is headed by a director, who is  appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year  term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Location. FHFA's headquarters is located at 400 Seventh Street  SW., Washington, DC 20024.
