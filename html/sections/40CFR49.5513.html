                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to each owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired, steam-generating equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3, equipment associated with coal and ash handling, and the two auxiliary steam boilers at the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) on the Navajo Nation located in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Air Quality Control Region (see 40 CFR 81.270).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compliance dates. Compliance with the requirements of this section is required upon the effective date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Absorber upset transition period means the 24-hour period following an upset of an SO2 absorber module which resulted in the absorber being taken out of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding. This rule provides an affirmative defense to actions for penalties brought for excess emissions that arise during certain malfunction episodes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Malfunction means any sudden and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused entirely or in part by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition or preventable equipment breakdown shall not be considered malfunctions. An affirmative defense is not available if during the period of excess emissions, there was an exceedance of the relevant ambient air quality standard that could be attributed to the emitting source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Owner or Operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises the NGS, any of the fossil fuel-fired, steam-generating equipment at the NGS, or the auxiliary steam boilers at the NGS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plant-wide means a weighted average of particulate matter and SO2 emissions for Units 1, 2, and 3 based on the heat input to each unit as determined by 40 CFR part 75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Point source means any crusher, any conveyor belt transfer point, any pneumatic material transferring, any baghouse or other control devices used to capture dust emissions from loading and unloading, and any other stationary point of dust that may be observed in conformance with Method 9 of Appendix A-4 of 40 CFR Part 60 (excluding stockpiles).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Regional Administrator means the Regional Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Region 9 or his/her authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Startup shall mean the period from start of fires in the boiler with fuel oil, to the time when the electrostatic precipitator is sufficiently heated such that the temperature of the air preheater inlet reaches 400 degrees Fahrenheit and when a unit reaches 300 MW net load. Proper startup procedures shall include energizing the electrostatic precipitator prior to the combustion of coal in the boiler. This rule provides an affirmative defense to actions for penalties brought for excess emissions that arise during startup episodes. An affirmative defense is not available if during the period of excess emissions, there was an exceedance of the relevant ambient air quality standard that could be attributed to the emitting source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Shutdown shall begin when the unit drops below 300 MW net load with the intent to remove the unit from service. The precipitator shall be maintained in service until boiler fans are

disengaged. This rule provides an affirmative defense to actions for penalties brought for excess emissions that arise during shutdown episodes. An affirmative defense is not available if during the period of excess emissions, there was an exceedance of the relevant ambient air quality standard that could be attributed to the emitting source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) means the sum of nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the flue gas, expressed as nitrogen dioxide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Emissions limitations and control measures--(1) Sulfur oxides.

Each owner or operator shall operate and maintain the existing dust suppression methods for controlling dust from the coal handling and storage facilities. Within ninety (90) days after promulgation of these regulations the owner or operator shall submit to the Regional Administrator a description of the dust suppression methods for controlling dust from the coal handling and storage facilities, fly ash handling and storage, and road sweeping activities.

Data obtained from the monitors shall be reported annually to the Regional Administrator. All particulate matter samplers shall operate at least once every six days, coinciding with the national particulate sampling schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Nothing herein shall limit EPA's ability to ask for a test at any time under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, and enforce against any violation of the Clean Air Act or this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A certified EPA Reference Method 9 of Appendix A-4 of 40 CFR Part 60 observer shall conduct a weekly visible emission observation for the equipment and activities described under Section 49.24(d)(3). If visible emissions are present at any of the equipment and/or activities, a 6-minute EPA Reference Method 9 observation shall be conducted.

However, it shall be an affirmative defense in an enforcement action seeking penalties if the owner or operator has met with all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The malfunction was the result of a sudden and unavoidable failure of process or air pollution control equipment and did not result from inadequate design or construction of the process or air pollution control equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The malfunction did not result from operator error or neglect, or from

improper operation or maintenance procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Steps were immediately taken to correct conditions leading to the malfunction, and the amount and duration of the excess emissions caused by the malfunction were minimized to the maximum extent practicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All emissions monitoring systems were kept in operation if at all possible; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The owner or operator's actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(1)</em> Applicability.
