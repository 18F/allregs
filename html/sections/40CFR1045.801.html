                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part. The definitions apply to all subparts unless we note otherwise. All undefined terms have the meaning the Clean Air Act gives to them. The definitions follow:</p><p class="depth0">Adjustable parameter means any device, system, or element of design that someone can adjust (including those which are difficult to access) and that, if adjusted, may affect emissions or engine performance during emission testing or normal in-use operation. This includes, but is not limited to, parameters related to injection timing and fueling rate. You may ask us to exclude a parameter that is difficult to access if it cannot be adjusted to affect emissions without significantly degrading engine performance, or if you otherwise show us that it will not be adjusted in a way that affects emissions during in-use operation.</p><p class="depth0">Aftertreatment means relating to a catalytic converter, particulate filter, or any other system, component, or technology mounted downstream of the exhaust valve (or exhaust port) whose design function is to decrease emissions in the engine exhaust before it is exhausted to the environment. Exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR), turbochargers, and oxygen sensors are not aftertreatment.</p><p class="depth0">Alcohol-fueled engine means an engine that is designed to run using an alcohol fuel. For purposes of this definition, alcohol fuels do not include fuels with a nominal alcohol content below 25 percent by volume.</p><p class="depth0">Amphibious vehicle means a vehicle with wheels or tracks that is designed primarily for operation on land and secondarily for operation in water.</p><p class="depth0">Applicable emission standard or applicable standard means an emission standard to which an engine (or vessel) is subject.

For example, we would not consider a filler neck to be a fuel line if an operator stops refueling after an initial automatic shutoff that signals the fuel tank is full, where any liquid fuel in the filler neck during the refueling procedure drains into the fuel tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> This does not include primer bulbs that contain liquid fuel only for priming the engine before starting.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel system means all components involved in transporting, metering, and mixing the fuel from the fuel tank to the combustion chamber(s), including the fuel tank, fuel tank cap, fuel pump, fuel filters, fuel lines, carburetor or fuel-injection components, and all fuel-system vents. In the case where the fuel tank cap or other components (excluding fuel lines) are directly mounted on the fuel tank, they are considered to be a part of the fuel tank.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel type means a general category of fuels such as gasoline or natural gas. There can be multiple grades within a single fuel type, such as low-temperature or all-season gasoline.</p><p class="depth0">Good engineering judgment has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30.

This includes importers who import engines or vessels for resale, but not dealers. All manufacturing entities under the control of the same person are considered to be a single manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">Marine engine means a nonroad engine that is installed or intended to be installed on a vessel. This includes a portable auxiliary marine engine only if its fueling, cooling, or exhaust system is an integral part of the vessel. There are two kinds of marine engines:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Propulsion marine engine means a marine engine that moves a vessel through the water or directs the vessel's movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Auxiliary marine engine means a marine engine not used for propulsion.</p><p class="depth0">Marine vessel has the meaning given in 1 U.S.C. 3, except that it does not include amphibious vehicles.

This must include January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year. For seasonal production periods not including January 1, model year means the calendar year in which the production occurs, unless you choose to certify the applicable engine family with the following model year. For example, if your production period is June 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010, your model year would be 2010 unless you choose to certify the engine family for model year 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For an engine that is converted to a propulsion marine engine after being certified and placed into service as a motor vehicle engine, a nonroad engine that is not a propulsion marine engine, or a stationary engine, model year means the calendar year in which the engine was originally produced. For an engine that is converted to a propulsion marine engine after being placed into service as a motor vehicle engine, a nonroad engine that is not a propulsion marine engine, or a stationary engine without having been certified, model year means the calendar year in which the engine becomes a new propulsion marine engine.

This addresses uncertified engines and vessels initially placed into service that someone seeks to import into the United States. Importation of this kind of engine (or vessel containing such an engine) is generally prohibited by 40 CFR part 1068.

Steady-state tests are either discrete-mode tests or ramped-modal tests.</p><p class="depth2">Sterndrive/inboard engine means a spark-ignition engine that is used to propel a vessel, but is not an outboard engine or a personal watercraft engine.
