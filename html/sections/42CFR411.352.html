                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, a group practice is a physician  practice that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Single legal entity. The group practice must consist of a single  legal entity operating primarily for the purpose of being a physician  group practice in any organizational form recognized by the State in  which the group practice achieves its legal status, including, but not  limited to, a partnership, professional corporation, limited liability  company, foundation, nonprofit corporation, faculty practice plan, or  similar association. The single legal entity may be organized by any  party or parties, including, but not limited to, physicians, health care  facilities, or other persons or entities (including, but not limited to,  physicians individually incorporated as professional corporations). The  single legal entity may be organized or owned (in whole or in part) by  another medical practice, provided that the other medical practice is  not an operating physician practice (and regardless of whether the  medical practice meets the conditions for a group practice under this  section). For purposes of this subpart, a single legal entity does not  include informal affiliations of physicians formed substantially to  share profits from referrals, or separate group practices under common  ownership or control through a physician practice management company,  hospital, health system, or other entity or organization. A group  practice that is otherwise a single legal entity may itself own  subsidiary entities. A group practice operating in more than one State  will be considered to be a single legal entity notwithstanding that it  is composed of multiple legal entities, provided that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The States in which the group practice is operating are  contiguous (although each State need not be contiguous to every other  State);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legal entities are absolutely identical as to ownership,  governance, and operation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Organization of the group practice into multiple entities is  necessary to comply with jurisdictional licensing laws of the States in  which the group practice operates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Physicians. The group practice must have at least two physicians  who are members of the group (whether employees or direct or indirect  owners), as defined at Sec. 411.351.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Range of care. Each physician who is a member of the group, as  defined at Sec. 411.351, must furnish substantially the full range of  patient care services that the physician routinely furnishes, including  medical care, consultation, diagnosis, and treatment, through the joint  use of shared office space, facilities, equipment, and personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Services furnished by group practice members. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as  otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of  this section, substantially all of the patient care services of the  physicians who are members of the group (that is, at least 75 percent of  the total patient care services of the group practice members) must be  furnished through the group and billed under a billing number assigned  to the group, and the amounts received must be treated as receipts of  the group. Patient care services must be measured by one of the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total time each member spends on patient care services  documented by any reasonable means (including, but not limited to, time  cards, appointment schedules, or personal diaries). (For example, if a  physician practices 40 hours a week and spends 30 hours a week on  patient care services for a group practice, the physician has spent 75  percent of his or her time providing patient care services for the  group.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any alternative measure that is reasonable, fixed in advance of  the performance of the services being measured, uniformly applied over  time, verifiable, and documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The data used to calculate compliance with this substantially  all test and related supportive documentation must be made available to  the Secretary upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The substantially all test set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section does not apply to any group practice that is located solely in a  HPSA, as defined at Sec. 411.351.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For a group practice located outside of a HPSA (as defined at  Sec. 411.351), any time spent by a group practice member providing  services in a HPSA should not be used to calculate whether the group  practice has met the substantially all test, regardless of whether the  member's time in the HPSA is spent in a group practice, clinic, or  office setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> does not apply when an existing group  practice admits a new member or reorganizes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the addition to an existing group practice of a new member  who would be considered to have relocated his or her medical practice  under Sec. 411.357(e)(2) would result in the existing group practice  not meeting the substantially all test set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section, the group practice will have 12 months following the  addition of the new member to come back into full compliance, provided  that--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For the 12-month period the group practice is fully compliant  with the substantially all test if the new member is not counted as a  member of the group for purposes of Sec. 411.352; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The new member's employment with, or ownership interest in, the  group practice is documented in writing no later than the beginning of  his or her new employment, ownership, or investment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This paragraph (d)(6) does not apply when an existing group  practice reorganizes or admits a new member who is not relocating his or  her medical practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distribution of expenses and income. The overhead expenses of,  and income   from, the practice must be distributed according to methods that are  determined before the receipt of payment for the services giving rise to  the overhead expense or producing the income. Nothing in this section  prevents a group practice from adjusting its compensation methodology  prospectively, subject to restrictions on the distribution of revenue  from DHS under Sec. 411.352(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unified business. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The group practice must be a unified  business having at least the following features:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Centralized decision-making by a body representative of the  group practice that maintains effective control over the group's assets  and liabilities (including, but not limited to, budgets, compensation,  and salaries); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consolidated billing, accounting, and financial reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Location and specialty-based compensation practices are  permitted with respect to revenues derived from services that are not  DHS and may be permitted with respect to revenues derived from DHS under  Sec. 411.352(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Volume or value of referrals. No physician who is a member of  the group practice directly or indirectly receives compensation based on  the volume or value of his or her referrals, except as provided in Sec.  411.352(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Physician-patient encounters. Members of the group must  personally conduct no less than 75 percent of the physician-patient  encounters of the group practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Special rule for productivity bonuses and profit shares. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  physician in the group practice may be paid a share of overall profits  of the group, provided that the share is not determined in any manner  that is directly related to the volume or value of referrals of DHS by  the physician. A physician in the group practice may be paid a  productivity bonus based on services that he or she has personally  performed, or services ``incident to'' such personally performed  services, or both, provided that the bonus is not determined in any  manner that is directly related to the volume or value of referrals of  DHS by the physician (except that the bonus may directly relate to the  volume or value of DHS referrals by the physician if the referrals are  for services ``incident to'' the physician's personally performed  services).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overall profits means the group's entire profits derived from  DHS payable by Medicare or Medicaid or the profits derived from DHS  payable by Medicare or Medicaid of any component of the group practice  that consists of at least five physicians. Overall profits should be  divided in a reasonable and verifiable manner that is not directly  related to the volume or value of the physician's referrals of DHS. The  share of overall profits will be deemed not to relate directly to the  volume or value of referrals if one of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The group's profits are divided per capita (for example, per  member of the group or per physician in the group).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Revenues derived from DHS are distributed based on the  distribution of the group practice's revenues attributed to services  that are not DHS payable by any Federal health care program or private  payer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Revenues derived from DHS constitute less than 5 percent of  the group practice's total revenues, and the allocated portion of those  revenues to each physician in the group practice constitutes 5 percent  or less of his or her total compensation from the group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A productivity bonus must be calculated in a reasonable and  verifiable manner that is not directly related to the volume or value of  the physician's referrals of DHS. A productivity bonus will be deemed  not to relate directly to the volume or value of referrals of DHS if one  of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bonus is based on the physician's total patient encounters  or relative value units (RVUs). (The methodology for establishing RVUs  is set forth in Sec. 414.22 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bonus is based on the allocation of the physician's  compensation attributable to services that are not DHS payable by any  Federal health care program or private payer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Revenues derived from DHS are less than 5 percent of the group  practice's total revenues, and the allocated portion of those revenues  to each physician in the group practice constitutes 5 percent or less of  his or her total compensation from the group practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supporting documentation verifying the method used to calculate  the profit share or productivity bonus under paragraphs (i)(2) and  (i)(3) of this section, and the resulting amount of compensation, must  be made available to the Secretary upon request.
