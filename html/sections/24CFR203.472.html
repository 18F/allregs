The agreement shall contain a provision for the resumption of monthly payments thereafter in amounts which will completely amortize the obligation within its original maturity. The agreement shall in no way affect the amount of the annual insurance premium which shall continue to be calculated in accordance with the original amortization provisions of the loan.</p>
