                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes the equipment required and the procedures to follow in order to perform gaseous exhaust, particulate, and evaporative emission tests on light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Subpart A of this part sets forth testing requirements and test intervals necessary to comply with EPA certification procedures. Not all emission measurement techniques described in this subpart will be necessary for all vehicles. Subpart A of this part defines the conditions under which vehicles may be exempted from measuring methane and/or waived from measuring particulate matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Three topics are addressed in this subpart. Sections 86.106 through 86.115 set forth specifications and equipment requirements; Secs. 86.116 through 86.126 discuss calibration methods and frequency; test procedures and data requirements are listed in Secs. 86.127 through 86.157.

Sec. 86.106-96  Equipment required; overview.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emission tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, e.g., evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate equipment, procedures, and calculation methods may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evaporative emission tests, gasoline-fueled vehicles. The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in Sec. 86.130-96; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under Sec. 86.090-26 or Sec. 86.1810, as applicable, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (see Sec. 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (see Sec. 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see Sec. 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and for mileage accumulation for petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles are specified in Sec. 86.113. Analytical gases are specified in Sec. 86.114. The Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), US06, and SC03 driving schedules, for use in exhaust emission tests, and the New York City Cycle (NYCC), for use with the UDDS in running loss tests, are specified in Secs. 86.115, 86.130, 86.159, 86.160, and appendix I to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
[58 FR 16026, Mar. 24, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 48504, Sept. 21, 1994; 60 FR 43888, Aug. 23, 1995; 64 FR 23921, May 4, 1999; 79 FR 23692, Apr. 28, 2014]


Sec. 86.107-96  Sampling and analytical systems; evaporative emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Testing enclosures--(1) Diurnal emission test. The enclosure shall be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for personnel access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.117-96. Interior surfaces must be impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons (and to methanol, if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). The temperature conditioning system shall be capable of controlling the internal enclosure air temperature to follow the prescribed temperature versus time cycle as specified in Sec. 86.133-96 and appendix II of this

part, within an instantaneous tolerance of [3.0 F of the nominal temperature versus time profile throughout the test, and an average tolerance of 2.0 F over the duration of the test (where the average is calculated using the absolute value of each measured deviation). The control system shall be tuned to provide a smooth temperature pattern that has a minimum of overshoot, hunting, and instability about the desired long-term ambient temperature profile. Interior surface temperatures shall not be less than 40 F at any time during the diurnal emission test. To accommodate the volume changes due to enclosure temperature changes, either a variable-volume or fixed-volume enclosure may be used for diurnal emission testing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Variable-volume enclosure. The variable-volume enclosure expands and contracts in response to the temperature change of the air mass in the enclosure. Two potential means of accommodating the internal volume changes are movable panel(s), or a bellows design, in which impermeable bag(s) inside the enclosure expand and contract in response to internal pressure changes by exchanging air from outside the enclosure. Any design for volume accommodation must maintain the integrity of the enclosure as specified in Sec. 86.117-96 over the specified temperature range. Any method of volume accommodation shall limit the differential between the enclosure internal pressure and the barometric pressure to a maximum value of [2.0 inches of water. The enclosure shall be capable of latching to a fixed volume. A variable-volume enclosure must be capable of accommodating a [7 percent change from its ``nominal volume'' (see Sec. 86.117-96(b)), accounting for temperature and barometric pressure variation during testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fixed-volume enclosure. The fixed-volume enclosure shall be constructed with rigid panels that maintain a fixed enclosure volume, and meet the following requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The enclosure shall be equipped with a mechanism to maintain a fixed internal air volume. This may be accomplished either by withdrawing air at a constant rate and providing makeup air as needed, or by reversing the flow of air into and out of the enclosure in response to rising or falling temperatures. If inlet air is added continuously throughout the test, it should be filtered with activated carbon to provide a relatively low and constant hydrocarbon level. Any method of volume accommodation shall maintain the differential between the enclosure internal pressure and the barometric pressure to a maximum value of [2.0 inches of water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The equipment shall be capable of measuring the mass of hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles) in the inlet and outlet flow streams with a resolution of 0.01 gram per hour. A bag sampling system may be used to collect a proportional sample of the air withdrawn from and admitted to the enclosure. Alternatively, the inlet and outlet flow streams may be continuously analyzed using an on-line FID analyzer and integrated with the flow measurements to provide a continuous record of the mass hydrocarbon and methanol removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Running loss test. The enclosure shall be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for personnel access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.117-96. The enclosure may be equipped with a personnel door, provided that the enclosure can still meet the requirements of Sec. 86.117-96 with the door installed. Interior surfaces must be impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons and to methanol (if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). Interior surface temperatures shall not be less than 40 F. If a running loss enclosure meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it may be used as a diurnal evaporative emission enclosure. The enclosure must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of Sec. 86.108. Provisions shall be made to remove exhaust gases from the enclosure. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be maintained at 95[5 F (95[2 F on average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator. The air required for vehicle

operation shall be provided by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The running loss enclosure may be equipped to supply air to the vehicle, at a temperature of 95[5 F, from sources outside of the running loss enclosure directly into the operating engine's air intake system. Supplemental air requirements (e.g., for an air pump) shall be supplied by drawing air from the engine intake source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If it is shown to yield equivalent or superior results, the running loss enclosure may be designed with an air makeup system that brings outside air into the enclosure to accommodate the aspiration needs of the engine and any auxiliary devices. The makeup air shall be monitored to establish the background hydrocarbon levels (or hydrocarbon and methanol, levels, if applicable) of the makeup air. A filter may be used to provide dry air with a stable concentration of background hydrocarbon. The makeup-air vent shall be readily sealable for calibration of the enclosure and other purposes. For calculation of running loss emissions, it may be assumed that the hydrocarbon and methanol concentration in the air consumed by the vehicle is the same as that of the rest of the air in the enclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Hot soak test. The hot soak test may be conducted by holding the vehicle in an enclosure that meets the requirements for either diurnal emission or running loss tests. The enclosure shall be configured to provide an internal enclosure ambient temperature of 95[10 F for the first 5 minutes, and 95[5 F (95[2 F on average) for the remainder of the hot soak test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the hot soak test is conducted in the same enclosure as the immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface temperatures shall not be below 70 F for the last 55 minutes of the hot soak test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the hot soak test is not conducted in the same enclosure as the immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface temperatures shall not be below 70 F for the duration of the hot soak test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol analyzers. (1) For gasoline fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere within the enclosure (a heated FID (HFID)(235[15 F (113[8 C)) is recommended for methanol-fueled vehicles). For natural gas-fueled vehicles, the FID may be calibrated using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon reading. Provided evaporative emission results are not effected, a probe may be used to detect or verify hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For methanol-fueled vehicles, a methanol sampling and analyzing system is required in addition to the FID analyzer. The methanol sampling equipment shall consist of impingers for collecting the methanol sample and appropriate equipment for drawing the sample through the impingers. The analytical equipment shall consist of a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methanol sampling system shall be designed such that, if a test vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all applicable standards) during any phase of the test, the measured concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer, and such that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air samples, since they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in which the concentrations approach the limit of detection. The provisions of this paragraph apply to the design of sampling systems, not to individual tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol data recording system. (1) The electrical output of the FID used for measuring hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons plus methanol, as appropriate)

shall be recorded at least at the initiation and termination of each running loss and hot soak test, and at least at the initiation and termination of the enclosure sampling period(s) for the diurnal emission test, as described in Sec. 86.133. The recording may be taken by means of a strip chart potentiometric recorder, by use of an on-line computer system or other suitable means. In any case, the recording system must have operational characteristics (signal-to-noise ratio, speed of response, etc.) equivalent to or better than those of the signal source being recorded, and must provide a permanent record of results. The record shall show a positive indication of the initiation and completion of each hot soak, running loss, or diurnal emission test (including initiation and completion of sampling period(s)), along with the time elapsed during each soak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the methanol sample, permanent records shall be made of the following: the volumes of deionized water introduced into each impinger, the rate and time of sample collection, the volumes of each sample introduced into the gas chromatograph, the flow rate of carrier gas through the column, the column temperature, and the chromatogram of the analyzed sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fuel temperature control system. Fuel temperatures of the test vehicle shall be controlled, as specified in Sec. 86.134(g)(1)(xv), with the following combination of fans. The control system shall be tuned and operated to provide a smooth and continuous fuel temperature profile that is representative of the on-road temperature profile. The running loss test configuration should be designed to avoid heating or cooling the fuel tank's vapor space in a way that would cause vapor temperature behavior to be unrepresentative of the vehicle's on-road profile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A vehicle cooling fan shall discharge air to the front of the vehicle. The fan shall be a road-speed modulated fan that is controlled to a discharge velocity that follows the dynamometer roll speed, at least up to speeds of 30 mph, throughout the driving cycle. If a warning light or gauge indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has overheated, subsequent test runs on the vehicle must include a vehicle cooling fan that follows the dynamometer roll speed at all speeds throughout the test cycle. The fan may direct airflow to both the vehicle radiator air inlet(s) and the vehicle underbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An additional fan may be used to discharge airflow from the front of the vehicle directly to the vehicle underbody to control fuel temperatures. Such a fan shall provide a total discharge airflow not to exceed 8,000 cfm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional fans may be used to route heating or cooling air directly at the bottom of the vehicle's fuel tank. The air supplied to the tank shall be between 85 and 160 F, with a total discharge airflow not to exceed 4,000 cfm. For exceptional circumstances, manufacturers may direct up to 6,000 cfm at the bottom of the fuel tank with the advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Direct fuel heating may be needed for canister preconditioning, as specified in Sec. 86.132(j)(2). Also, under exceptional circumstances in which airflow alone is insufficient to control fuel temperatures during the running loss test, direct fuel tank heating may be used (see Sec. 86.134-96(g)(1)(xv)). The heating system must not cause hot spots on the tank wetted surface that could cause local overheating of the fuel. Heat must not be applied directly to the tank's vapor space, nor to the liquid-vapor interface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Pressure recording system. A strip chart potentiometric recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means, shall be used to record the enclosure gage pressure for any testing in an enclosure, as well as the vehicle's fuel tank pressure during the running loss test and the outdoor driving procedure specified in Sec. 86.129-94(d). Fuel tank pressure measurement and recording equipment are optional during the running loss test. The recording system shall record each pressure at least once every minute. The recording system shall be capable of resolving time to [15 s and capable of resolving pressure to [0.1 inches of water. The pressure recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an accuracy of [1.0 inch of water. The recorder (data processor) shall have a time accuracy

of [15 s and a precision of [15 s. The pressure transducer shall be installed to measure the pressure in the vapor space of the fuel tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Purge blower. One or more portable or fixed blowers shall be used to purge the enclosure. The blowers shall have sufficient flow capacity to reduce the enclosure hydrocarbon and/or methanol concentration from the test level to the ambient level between tests. Actual flow capacity will depend upon the time available between tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Mixing blower. Blowers or fans shall be used to mix the enclosure contents during evaporative emission testing. The inlets and outlets of the air circulation blower(s) shall be configured to provide a well dispersed air circulation pattern that produces effective internal mixing and avoids significant temperature or hydrocarbon stratification. Maintenance of uniform concentrations throughout the enclosure is important to the accuracy of testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Diurnal emission test. Blowers or fans shall have a capacity of 0.8[0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume for mixing in the enclosure. Additional fans may be used to maintain a minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) under the fuel tank of the test vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Running loss test. Blowers or fans shall have a total capacity of at least 1.0 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Hot soak test. Blowers or fans must have a capacity of 0.8[0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume. Circulated air shall not be aimed directly at the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Point-source running loss measurement facility. Some system requirements pertain specifically to running loss testing by the point-source method, in which emissions from potential sources are collected and routed to a sampling system. Emissions are sampled with the same equipment and techniques as for exhaust emission measurement. The test environment must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of Sec. 86.108. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be maintained at 95[5 F (95[2 F on average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The running loss vapor vent collection system shall be configured to collect all running loss emissions from each of the discrete point sources that function as vehicle fuel system vapor vents, and transport the collected vapor emissions to a CFV- or PDP-based dilution and measurement system. The collection system shall consist of a collector at each vehicle vapor vent, lengths of heated sample line connecting each collector to the inlet of the heated sample pump, and lengths of heated sample line connecting the outlet of the heated sample pump to the inlet of the running loss fuel vapor sampling system. Up to 3 feet of unheated line connecting each of the vapor collectors to the heated sample lines shall be allowed. Each heated sample pump and its associated sample lines shall be maintained at a temperature between 175 F and 200 F to prevent condensation of fuel vapor in the sample lines. The heated sample pump(s) and its associated flow controls shall be configured and operated to draw a flow of ambient air into each collector at a flow rate of at least 0.67 cfm. The flow controls on each heated sampling system shall include an indicating flow meter that provides an alarm output to the data recording system if the flow rate drops below 0.67 cfm by more than 5 percent. The collector inlet for each discrete vapor vent shall be placed in proximity to the vent as necessary to capture any fuel vapor emissions without significantly affecting flow or pressure of the normal action of the vent. The collector inlets shall be designed to interface with the configuration and orientation of each specific vapor vent. For vapor vents that terminate in a tube or hose barb, a short length of tubing of an inside diameter larger throughout its length than the inside diameter of the vent outlet may be used to extend the vent into the mouth of the collector. For those vapor vent designs that are not compatible with such collector configurations, the vehicle manufacturer shall supply a collector that is configured to interface with the vapor vent design and that terminates in a fitting that is capable of capturing all vapor

emitted from the vent. The Administrator may test for running losses by the point-source method without heating sample lines or pumps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be a CFV- or PDP-based dilution and measurement system that further dilutes the running loss fuel vapors collected by the vapor vent collection system(s) with ambient air, collects continuously proportional samples of the diluted running loss vapors and dilution air in sample bags, and measures the total dilute flow through the sampling system over each test interval. In practice, the system shall be configured and operated in a manner that is directly analogous to an exhaust emissions constant volume sampling system, except that the input flow to the system is the flow from the running loss vapor vent collection system(s) instead of vehicle exhaust flow. The system shall be configured and operated to meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be designed to measure the true mass of fuel vapor emissions collected by the running loss vapor vent collection system from the specified fuel vapor vents. The total volume of the mixture of running loss emissions and dilution air shall be measured and a continuously proportioned sample of volume shall be collected for analysis. Mass emissions shall be determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The PDP-CVS shall consist of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, heat exchanger, positive-displacement pump, sampling system, and associated valves, pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS shall conform to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the positive-displacement pump, shall be within [10 F of the designed operating temperature at the start of the test. The gas mixture temperature variation from its value at the start of the test shall be limited to [10 F during the entire test. The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of [2 F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of [1.6 inches of water ([0.4 kPa).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The flow capacity of the CVS shall not exceed 350 cfm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sample collection bags for dilution air and running loss fuel vapor samples shall be sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The CFV sample system shall consist of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, a sampling venturi, a critical flow venturi, a sampling system and assorted valves, and pressure and temperature sensors. The CFV sample system shall conform to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of [2 F and a response time of 0.100 seconds of 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in hot silicone oil).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of [1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The flow capacity of the CVS shall not exceed 350 cfm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sample collection bags for dilution air and running loss fuel vapor samples shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An on-line computer system or strip-chart recorder shall be used to record the following additional parameters during the running loss test sequence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFV (if used) inlet temperature and pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PDP (if used) inlet temperature, pressure, and differential pressure.

A strip chart potentiometric recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means shall be used to record enclosure ambient temperature during all evaporative emission test segments, as well as vehicle fuel tank temperature during the running loss test. The recording system shall record each temperature at least once every minute.

The operation of the Critical Flow Venturi-Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) sample system, Figure B94-4, is based upon the principles of fluid dynamics associated with critical flow. Proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions is maintained by use of small

CFVs in the sample lines (for methanol-fueled vehicles, one line supplies sample for the bag sample, another line supplies sample for the methanol sample, and a third line supplies sample for the formaldehyde sample.) The methanol and formaldehyde sample lines are heated to prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more than 5 F (3 C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 250 F (121 C). Care should be taken to ensure that the CFVs of the sample probes are not heated since heating of the CFVs would cause loss of proportionality. The variable mixture flow rate is maintained at sonic velocity, is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas temperature, and is computed continuously. Since the pressure and temperature are the same at all venturi inlets, the sample volume is proportional to the total volume. (Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated with methanol.)

Figure B94-7 is a schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical system for samples from bag sampling systems for analysis of total hydrocarbon (THC) (hydrocarbon plus methanol in the case of methanol-fueled vehicles), methane (CH4) (for vehicles subject to the NMHC and NMHCE standards), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOX). The schematic diagram of the continuous THC analysis train (and for THC plus methanol for methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles) is shown as part of Figure B94-5 (or Figure B94-6). Since various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance with either drawing is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.154</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Major component description. The exhaust gas analytical system, Figure B94-7, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) (heated, 235 [15 F (113 [8 C) for methanol-fueled vehicles) for the determination of THC, a methane analyzer (consisting of a gas chromatograph combined with a FID) for the determination of CH4, non-dispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the determination of CO and CO2, a chemiluminescence analyzer (CL) for the determination of NOX, and an analyzer meeting the requirements specified in 40 CFR 1065.275 for the determination of N2O. A heated flame ionization detector (HFID) is used for the continuous determination of THC from

petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles (may also be used with methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), Figure B94-5 (or B94-6). The analytical system for methanol consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The analysis for formaldehyde is performed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) detection. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The CL requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The carbon monoxide (CO) NDIR analyzer may require a sample conditioning column containing CaSO4, or indicating silica gel to remove water vapor, and containing ascarite to remove carbon dioxide from the CO analysis stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If CO instruments which are essentially free of CO2 and water vapor interference are used, the use of the conditioning column may be deleted, see Secs. 86.122 and 86.144.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of CO2 and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of 3 percent CO2 in N2 which has been bubbled through water at room temperature produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than l percent of full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale, see Sec. 86.122.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles (and if selected, for methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel vehicles) a continuous hydrocarbon sample shall be measured using a heated analyzer train as shown in Figure B90-5 (or B90-6).

In this type of system (figures B82-3A and B82-4A), zero or span gas is introduced into the heated sample line at a flow rate that exceeds the sample flow rate to the HFID. The excess gas overflows the sample probe into the dilution tunnel. This method assures that the reference gas enters HFID in the same concentration as the injected reference gas and at the same rate as the sample exhaust gas. In addition to zero and span checks, it may also be used to calibrate the THC analyzer per Sec. 86.121-82(b). The overflow gas flow rate into the sample line shall be greater than 125 percent of the HFID flow rate with the CVS blower operating. A lower flow rate may be used if it has been experimentally shown to produce equivalent results and current documentation is maintained. The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close as practicable to the outside surface of the dilution tunnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous THC sample probe, line, or system, unless a common sample pump is used of all analyzers and the single sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sample transport time from sampling point to inlet of instrument shall be less than 4 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel vehicles, the sample line and filter shall be heated to maintain a sample gas temperature of 375 [10 F (191 [6 C) before the filter and before the HFID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles, the sample line and filter shall be heated to maintain a sample gas temperature of 235 [15 F (113 [8 C) before the filter and before the HFID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Using a methane analyzer consisting of a gas chromatograph combined with a FID, measure methane according to SAE J1151 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 86.1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other analyzers and equipment.

Sec. 86.117-96  Evaporative emission enclosure calibrations.</p><p class="depth0">The calibration of evaporative emission enclosures consists of three parts: initial and periodic determination of enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol retention check and calibration. Ethanol retention checks may be performed instead of methanol retention checks. Alcohol retentions may be omitted if no alcohol-fueled vehicles will be tested in the evaporative enclosure. For evaporative and refueling emission tests with ethanol-gasoline blends that have less than 25% ethanol by volume, if you account for ethanol with a mathematical adjustment as described in Sec. 86.1813-17(a)(1)(iv) instead of measuring ethanol, the testing specifications and diagnostic requirements in this part 86 that are specific to ethanol-gasoline blends do not apply. Alternate calibration methods may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the Administrator; specifically, more extreme temperatures may be used for determining calibration without affecting the validity of test results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, and after any repair that can affect the enclosure background emissions, the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not contain materials that will themselves

emit hydrocarbons or methanol. When methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the evaporative enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement includes the partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the hydrocarbons. Determination of the HFID response to methanol, Sec. 86.121, prior to its being placed in service is required for the determination of hydrocarbons. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prepare the enclosure. (i) Variable-volume enclosures may be operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 96[3 F throughout the 4-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fixed-volume enclosures may be operated with inlet and outlet flow streams either closed or open; if inlet and outlet flow streams are open, the air flowing into and out of the enclosure must be monitored in accordance with Sec. 86.107-96(a)(1)(ii)(B). Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 96[3 F throughout the 4-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For running loss enclosures ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 95[3 F throughout the 4-hour period. For running loss enclosures designed with a vent for makeup air, the enclosure shall be operated with the vent closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a period of up to 12 hours before the 4-hour background sampling period begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prior to the background determination, purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure.</p><p class="depth0">These are the initial readings CHCi, CCH3OHi, and PBi, Ti for the enclosure background determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed for four hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Measure the hydrocarbon concentration on the same FID and the methanol level. These are the final concentrations, CHCf and CCH3OHf. Also measure final temperature and barometric pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Diurnal enclosures. The enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.05g for the 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Running loss enclosures. The enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.2 grams for the 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be determined by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate the internal volume. For variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at a constant temperature; this nominal volume shall be repeatable within [0.5 percent of the reported value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)-(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hydrocarbon and methanol (organic gas) retention check and calibration. The hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles) retention check provides a check upon the calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. The enclosure leak rate shall be determined prior to its introduction into service, following any modifications or repairs to the enclosure that may affect the integrity of the enclosure, and at least monthly thereafter. The methanol retention check must be performed only upon initial installation and after major maintenance, consistent with good engineering judgment. If six consecutive monthly retention checks are successfully completed without corrective action, the enclosure leak rate may be determined quarterly thereafter as long as no corrective action is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An enclosure to be used for the diurnal emission test (see Sec. 86.133-96)

shall be calibrated according to the following procedure. Calibration for hydrocarbon and methanol may be conducted simultaneously or in sequential test runs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Turn on the mixing blowers (if not already on).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Turn on the ambient temperature control system (if not already on) and adjust it for an initial temperature of 96 F (36 C).

On fixed-volume enclosures close the outlet and inlet flow streams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When the enclosure stabilizes at 96[3 F (36[2 C), seal the enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the initial readings CHCi, CCH3OHi, Ti, and PBi for the enclosure calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Inject into the enclosure 0.5 to 1.0 grams of pure methanol at a recommended temperature of at least 150 F (65 C) and/or 0.5 to 1.0 grams of pure propane at lab ambient temperature. The injected quantity may be measured by volume flow or by mass measurement. The method used to measure the quantity of methanol and propane must have an accuracy of [0.5 percent of the measured value (less accurate methods may be used with the advance approval of the Administrator).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention check.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (viii) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section. This quantity must be within [2 percent of that measured in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section for propane and [5 percent for methanol. Evaluate long-term trends using good engineering judgment to minimize measurement bias. Keep records to document such evaluations and make them available to EPA upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> For variable-volume enclosures, unlatch the enclosure from the nominal volume configuration. For fixed-volume enclosures, open the outlet and inlet flow streams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Start cycling the ambient temperature from 96 F to 72 F and back to 96 F over a 24-hour period, according to the profile specified in Sec. 86.133-96 and appendix II of this part, within 15 minutes of sealing the enclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> At the completion of the 24-hour cycling period, analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; determine the net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal emission testing with fixed volume enclosures); record temperature and barometric pressure. These are the final readings for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention check. The final hydrocarbon and methanol mass, calculated in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be within three percent of that determined in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, the difference may exceed [3 percent for methanol, provided it does not exceed [6 percent.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An enclosure to be used for the running loss test (see Sec. 86.134-96) shall meet the calibration and retention requirements of Sec. 86.117-90(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Enclosures calibrated according to the procedures specified in either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section may be used for hot soak testing (see Sec. 86.138).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculations.

Sec. 86.119-90  CVS calibration.</p><p class="depth0">The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve. Measurements of various parameters are made and related to flow through the unit. Procedures used by EPA for both PDP and CFV are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system can be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system, e.g., analyzer calibration. A verification procedure is found in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> PDP calibrations. (1) The following calibration procedure outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS pump. All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate ft\3\/min (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value on a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes ([2 F (1.1 C)) in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Connect a system as shown in Figure B90-8.

The procedures described in this subpart are used to determine the conformity of vehicles with the standards set forth in subpart A or S of this part (as applicable) for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. Except where noted, the procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and the contents of Secs. 86.135-00, 86.136-90, 86.137-96, 86.140-94, 86.142-90, and 86.144-94 are applicable for determining emission results for vehicle exhaust emission systems designed to comply with the FTP emission standards, or the FTP emission element required for determining compliance with composite SFTP standards. Paragraph (e) of this section discusses fuel spitback emissions. Paragraphs (f) and

(g) of this section discuss the additional test elements of aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03) that comprise the exhaust emission components of the SFTP. Paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section are applicable to all vehicle emission test procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, parking, and operating test conditions. Vehicles are tested for any or all of the following emissions, depending upon the specific test requirements and the vehicle fuel type:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gaseous exhaust THC, NMHC, NMOG, CO, NOX, CO2, N2O, CH4, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H4O, and HCHO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Particulates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles) and CH3OH (for methanol-fueled vehicles).

Additionally, for ethanol-fueled vehicles, ethanol and acetaldehyde are collected continuously for analysis as in paragraph (b) of this section. THC, methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde are collected using heated sample lines, and a heated FID is used for THC analyses. Simultaneous with the gaseous exhaust collection and analysis, particulates from a proportional part of the diluted exhaust are collected continuously on a filter.

(i) To be tested for running losses, as specified in Sec. 86.134, a vehicle must have a fuel temperature profile. The following procedure is used to generate the fuel temperature profile, which serves as a target for controlling fuel temperatures during the running loss test. This profile represents the fuel temperature change that occurs during on-road driving. If a vehicle has more than one fuel tank, a profile shall be established for each tank. Manufacturers may also simultaneously generate a profile for vapor temperatures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a manufacturer uses a vehicle model to develop a profile to represent multiple models, the vehicle model selected must have the greatest expected fuel temperature increase during driving of all those models it represents. Also, manufacturers must select test vehicles with any available vehicle options that increase fuel temperatures during driving (for example, any feature that limits underbody airflow).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturers may conduct testing to develop fuel temperature profiles in a laboratory setting, subject to approval by the Administrator. The laboratory facility should simulate outdoor testing to reproduce fuel and vapor temperature behavior over the

specified driving schedule. The design of the laboratory facility should include consideration of any parameters that may affect fuel temperatures, such as solar loading, pavement heat, and relative wind velocities around and underneath the test vehicle. Indoor testing to develop the fuel temperature profiles must be conducted with little or no vehicle-specific adjustment of laboratory parameters. Manufacturers would need to maintain an ongoing demonstration of correlation between laboratory and outdoor measurement of fuel temperatures. Specifically, fuel temperatures and pressures from indoor driving should be at least as high as measured when driving outdoors according to the procedures described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Small-volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.094-14(b)(1), may use an alternate method for generating fuel temperature profiles, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Administrator may conduct testing to establish any vehicle's temperature profiles or to verify compliance with fuel tank pressure requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle instrumentation. (i) The vehicle must be equipped with temperature sensors and pressure transducers, as described in Sec. 86.107-96 (e) and (f), and a driver's aid, which shall be configured to provide the test driver with the desired vehicle speed vs. time trace and the actual vehicle speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A computer, data logger, or strip chart data recorder shall record the following parameters at a minimum during the test run:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Desired speed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Actual speed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Instantaneous average liquid fuel temperature (Tliq); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vapor space pressure (the Administrator may omit measurement of fuel tank pressure).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The data recording system described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section shall be capable of resolving time to [1 s, capable of resolving temperature to [2 F, capable of resolving pressure to [1.0 inch of water, and capable of resolving speed to [1 mph. The temperature and pressure signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 minute; speed signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 second.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ambient conditions.

Conditions should be representative of sunny summer days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Starting ambient temperature (Tamb, o) shall be at least 95 F, steady or increasing (no more than 2 F drop) during the procedure. Ambient temperature shall be measured and recorded in regular intervals of at least once every 5 minutes. Measure ambient temperature with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The sensors shall be mounted 5 [1 feet (1.5 [0.3 meters) above ground level. The sensors shall be protected from radiation from the sun, sky, earth, and any other surrounding objects, but at the same time be adequately ventilated. The sensors shall be installed in such a position as to ensure that measurements are representative of the free air circulation in the locality and not influenced by artificial conditions such as large buildings, cooling towers, and expanses of concrete and tarmac. Keep any grass and vegetation within 100 feet (30 meters) of the sensor clipped to a height of about 10 inches (25 centimeters) or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Wind conditions shall be calm to light with maximum wind speed of 15 mph. In the case of temporary gusting, wind speeds between 15 and 25 mph may occur for up to 5 percent of the total driving time without invalidating the data collection. Wind speed shall be measured and recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. Measure wind speed with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The site should be relatively level, but small gradual slopes are acceptable. The sensor shall be mounted 30 to 33 feet (9 to 10 meters) above the average ground height within a radius of 500 feet (150 meters). The sensor height shall not exceed 33 feet, except as necessary to be at least 15 feet (5 meters) above the height of any obstruction (e.g. vegetation, buildings, etc.) within a 500 foot (150 meter) radius. An object is considered to be an obstruction if the included lateral

angle from the sensor to the ends of the object is 10 degrees or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Road surface temperature shall be at least 125 F throughout the driving period. Pavement temperature shall be measured and recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. The track temperature may be measured with an embedded sensor, a portable temperature probe, or an infrared pyrometer that can provide an accuracy of [2 F.

(i) Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The test fuel should meet the specifications of Sec. 86.113, except that fuel with a lower volatility may be used, subject to Administrator approval. Manufacturers using a lower volatility fuel must generate a vapor temperature profile for demonstrating compliance with the limit on fuel tank pressure during the running loss test (see Sec. 86.134-96).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vehicle shall be moved to the location where the data is to be collected. It may be driven a maximum distance of 5 miles and may also be transported by other means. The vehicle shall be stabilized by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vehicle shall be parked for a minimum of 12 hours in an open area on a surface that is representative of the test road, without any artificial heating or cooling of the fuel. The orientation of the front of the vehicle during parking (e.g., N, SW, etc.) shall be documented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The vehicle may be soaked in a temperature-controlled environment to stabilize fuel temperatures. Before starting the drive, the vehicle shall be stabilized with fuel temperatures 95 [3 F for at least one hour. The fuel temperature may not exceed 98 F at any time before the beginning of the driving schedule, during which only whole-vehicle heating and cooling may be used to control fuel temperatures. If a manufacturer uses the provisions of paragraph (d)(7)(v) of this section to establish a lower initial fuel temperature for the running loss test, the fuel in the test vehicle may not be stabilized at a temperature higher than the newly established initial fuel temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once the ambient conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section are met and the vehicle has been stabilized according to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the vehicle's engine may be started. The vehicle's air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system set at 72 F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The vehicle may be operated at minimum throttle for a period up to 60 seconds prior to the start of the driving schedule, as necessary to move from the parking location onto the road surface. The driver's aid shall be started and the vehicle operated over the driving cycle specified in Sec. 86.134-96(b) with the transmission operated in the same manner as specified in Sec. 86.128-79. The data recording system shall provide a record of the required parameters over the entire period of driving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records required. In addition to the vehicle data recording, the following parameters shall be documented for the determination of the fuel temperature profile:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Date and time of vehicle fueling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Odometer reading at vehicle fueling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Date and time vehicle was parked, parking location and orientation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Odometer reading at parking;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Date and time engine was started;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Time of initiation of first UDDS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Time of completion of the driving cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Ambient temperatures throughout the period of driving (Tamb);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Wind speed throughout the period of driving;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Track surface temperatures throughout the period of driving cycle (Tsur);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Percent cloud cover during the period of driving; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Ambient temperature, wind speed, and percent cloud cover reported by the nearest weather station for the time corresponding most closely to the period of driving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fuel tank pressure.

The absolute temperature profile is determined by adding 95 F (35 C) to each point of the relative profile. Other methodologies for developing corrected liquid fuel and vapor space temperature profiles may be used if demonstrated to yield equivalent results and approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Manufacturers may use a lower initial fuel temperature for the running loss test, if approved in advance by the Administrator. To demonstrate the need for such an adjustment, manufacturers would be expected to determine the maximum fuel temperature experienced by a vehicle during an extended park or after driving one UDDS cycle when exposed to the ambient conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. To use this provision, manufacturers would have to show maximum fuel temperatures no greater than 92 F.

Sec. 86.134-96  Running loss test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to be tested for running loss emissions during simulated high-temperature urban driving; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. During operation, tank temperatures are controlled according to a prescribed profile to simulate in-use conditions. If the vehicle is determined to have exceeded the standard before the end of the running loss test, the test may be terminated without invalidating the data. The test can be run either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source method, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running loss test; however,

if testing by the Administrator shows that a vehicle has exceeded an emission standard without measurement of vapor temperatures, the manufacturer may, utilizing its own resources, conduct subsequent testing on that vehicle to determine if the exceedance is attributable to inadequate control of vapor temperatures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Driving schedule. Conduct the running loss test by operating the test vehicle through one Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), a 2-minute idle, two New York City Cycles, another 2-minute idle, another UDDS, then another 2-minute idle (see Sec. 86.115 and appendix I of this part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be operated according to the specifications of Sec. 86.128 during the driving cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dynamometer operation. (1) The exhaust from the vehicle must be routed outside the test cell or enclosure. Exhaust gases may, but need not, be collected and sampled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90(c) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may not be performed at test point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90 (e) and (f) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it shall be set within 1 hour prior to the running loss test phase. The test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set any time prior to the beginning of the emissions test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions shall be used to determine the actual driving distance for the running loss test, DRL, required in Sec. 86.143. The revolutions shall be measured on the same roll or shaft used for measuring the vehicle's speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Provisions of Sec. 86.135-90(i) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The test run may be stopped if a warning light or gauge indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has overheated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Engine starting and restarting.

This may be repeated for up to three start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three attempts, the reason for failure to start shall be determined. If failure to start is an operational error, the vehicle shall be rescheduled for testing, starting with the soak period immediately preceding the running loss test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If failure to start is caused by a vehicle malfunction, corrective action of less than 30 minutes duration may be taken (according to Sec. 86.090-25), and the test continued, provided that the ambient conditions to which the vehicle is exposed are maintained at 95[5 F (35[3 C). When the engine starts, the timing sequence of the driving schedule shall begin. If failure to start is caused by vehicle malfunction and the vehicle cannot be started, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, and corrective action may be taken according to Sec. 86.090-25. The reason for the malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken shall be reported to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provisions of Sec. 86.136-90(e) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Pressure checks. No pressure checks of the evaporative system shall be allowed. Under no circumstances will any changes/repairs to the evaporative emissions control system be allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Temperature stabilization. Immediately after the hot transient exhaust emission test, the vehicle shall be soaked in a temperature controlled area for a maximum of 6 hours until the fuel temperature is stabilized. The fuel may be heated or cooled to stabilize fuel temperatures, but the fuel heating rate must not exceed 5 F in any 1-hour interval during the soak period.

Sec. 86.135-12  Dynamometer procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the provisions of Secs. 86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test following the ``cold'' start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the UDDS, and engine shutdown make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air in the dilution tunnel as shown in Figure B94-5 and Figure B94-6. A dilution tunnel is not required for testing vehicles waived from the requirement to measure particulates.

For guidance see Sec. 86.137-90.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of Sec. 86.137-90 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ``[Reserved].''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a cold start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the provisions of Sec. 86.132, and a hot start test following the cold start test by 10 minutes. The vehicle shall be stored prior to the emission test in such a manner that precipitation (e.g., rain or dew) does not occur on the vehicle. The complete dynamometer test consists of a cold start drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km) and simulates a hot start drive of 7.5 miles (12.1 km). The vehicle is allowed to stand on the dynamometer during the 10 minute time period between the cold and hot start tests. The cold start test is divided into two periods. The first period, representing the cold start ``transient'' phase, terminates at the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 505 seconds of the driving schedule. The second period, representing the ``stabilized'' phase, consists of the remainder of the driving schedule including engine shutdown. The hot start test, similarly, consists of two periods. The first period, representing the hot start ``transient'' phase, terminates at the same point in driving schedule as the first period of the cold start test. The second period of the hot start test, ``stabilized'' phase, is assumed to be identical to the second period of the cold start test.

This preconditioning is followed by a 10 minute vehicle soak (engine off) that proceeds directly into the SC03 driving schedule, during which continuous proportional samples of gaseous emissions are collected for analysis. The entire test, including the preconditioning driving, vehicle soak, and SC03 official test cycle, is either conducted in an environmental test facility or under test conditions that simulates testing in an environmental test cell (see Sec. 86.162-00 (a) for a discussion of simulation procedure approvals). The environmental test facility must be capable of providing the following nominal ambient test conditions of: 95 F air temperature, 100 grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent relative humidity), a solar heat load intensity of 850 W/m\2\, and vehicle cooling air flow proportional to vehicle speed. Section 86.161-00 discusses the minimum facility requirements and corresponding control tolerances for air conditioning ambient test conditions. The vehicle's air conditioner is operated or appropriately simulated for the duration of the test procedure (except for the vehicle 10 minute soak), including the preconditioning. For gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, CO, CO2, CH4, and NOX.

Sec. 86.165-12  Air conditioning idle test procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section describes procedures for determining air conditioning-related CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. The results of this test are used to qualify for air conditioning efficiency CO2 credits according to Sec. 86.1866-12(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overview. The test consists of a brief period to stabilize the vehicle at idle, followed by a ten-minute period at idle when CO2 emissions are measured without any air conditioning systems operating, followed by a ten-minute period at idle when CO2 emissions are measured with the air conditioning system operating. This test is designed to determine the air conditioning-related CO2 emission value, in grams per minute. If engine stalling occurs during cycle operation, follow the provisions of Sec. 86.136-90 to restart the test. Measurement instruments must meet the specifications described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test cell ambient conditions. (1) Ambient humidity within the test cell during all phases of the test sequence shall be controlled to an average of 40-60 grains of water/pound of dry air.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ambient air temperature within the test cell during all phases of the test sequence shall be controlled to 73-80 F on average and 75 [5 F as an instantaneous measurement. Air temperature shall be recorded continuously at intervals of not more than 30 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test sequence. (1) Connect the vehicle exhaust system to the raw sampling location or dilution stage according to the provisions of this subpart. For dilution systems, dilute the exhaust as described in this subpart. Continuous sampling systems must meet the specifications provided in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test the vehicle in a fully warmed-up condition. If the vehicle has soaked for two hours or less since the last exhaust test element, preconditioning may consist of a 505 Cycle, 866 Cycle, US06, or SC03, as these terms are defined in Sec. 86.1803-01, or a highway fuel economy test procedure, as defined in Sec. 600.002-08 of this chapter. For soak periods longer than two hours, precondition the vehicle using one full Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule. Ensure that the vehicle has stabilized at test cell ambient conditions such that the vehicle interior temperature is not substantially different from the external test cell temperature. Windows may be opened during preconditioning to achieve this stabilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Immediately after the preconditioning, turn off any cooling fans, if present, close the vehicle's hood, fully close all the vehicle's windows, ensure that all the vehicle's air conditioning systems are set to full off, start the CO2 sampling system, and then idle the vehicle for not less than 1 minute and not more than 5 minutes to achieve normal and stable idle operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Measure and record the continuous CO2 concentration for 600 seconds. Measure the CO2 concentration continuously using raw or dilute sampling procedures. Multiply this concentration by the continuous (raw or dilute) flow rate at the emission sampling location to determine the CO2 flow rate. Calculate the CO2 cumulative flow rate continuously over the test interval. This cumulative value is the total mass of the emitted CO2. Alternatively, CO2 may be measured and recorded using a constant velocity sampling system as described in Secs. 86.106-96(a)(2) and 86.109.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Within 60 seconds after completing the measurement described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, turn on the vehicle's air conditioning system. Set automatic air conditioning systems to a temperature 9 F (5 C) below the ambient temperature of the test cell. Set manual air conditioning systems to maximum cooling with recirculation turned off, except that recirculation shall be enabled if the air conditioning system automatically defaults to a recirculation mode when set to maximum cooling. Continue idling the vehicle while measuring and recording the continuous CO2 concentration for 600 seconds as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Air

conditioning systems with automatic temperature controls are finished with the test after this 600 second idle period. Manually controlled air conditioning systems must complete one additional idle period as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> This paragraph (d)(6) applies only to manually controlled air conditioning systems. Within 60 seconds after completing the measurement described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, leave the vehicle's air conditioning system on and set as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section but set the fan speed to the lowest setting that continues to provide air flow. Recirculation shall be turned off except that if the system defaults to a recirculation mode when set to maximum cooling and maintains recirculation with the low fan speed, then recirculation shall continue to be enabled. After the fan speed has been set, continue idling the vehicle while measuring and recording the continuous CO2 concentration for a total of 600 seconds as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculations. (1) For the measurement with no air conditioning operation, calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams per minute) by dividing the total mass of CO2 from paragraph (d)(4) of this section by 10.0 (the duration in minutes for which CO2 is measured). Round this result to the nearest tenth of a gram per minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For the measurement with air conditioning in operation for automatic air conditioning systems, calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams per minute) by dividing the total mass of CO2 from paragraph (d)(5) of this section by 10.0. Round this result to the nearest tenth of a gram per minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the measurement with air conditioning in operation for automatic air conditioning systems, calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams per minute) by dividing the total mass of CO2 from paragraph (d)(5) of this section by 10.0. Round this result to the nearest tenth of a gram per minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the measurement with air conditioning in operation for manually controlled air conditioning systems, calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams per minute) by summing the total mass of CO2 from paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section and dividing by 20.0. Round this result to the nearest tenth of a gram per minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the increased CO2 emissions due to air conditioning (in grams per minute) by subtracting the results of paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the results of paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator may prescribe procedures other than those in this section for air conditioning systems and/or vehicles that may not be susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures and methods in this section. For example, the Administrator may prescribe alternative air conditioning system settings for systems with controls that are not able to meet the requirements in this section.
