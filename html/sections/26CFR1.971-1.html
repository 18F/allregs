                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Export trade corporations--(1) In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade corporation'' means a controlled foreign corporation which for the period specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph satisfies the conditions specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. However, no controlled foreign corporation may qualify as an export trade corporation for any taxable year beginning after October 31, 1971, unless it qualified as an export trade corporation for any taxable year beginning before such date. In addition, if a corporation fails to qualify as an export trade corporation for a period of any 3 consecutive taxable years beginning after October 31, 1971, then for any taxable year beginning after such 3-year period, such corporation shall not be included within the term ``export trade corporation''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade corporation'' means a controlled foreign corporation which for the period specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph satisfies the conditions specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. However, no controlled foreign corporation may qualify as an export trade corporation for any taxable year beginning after October 31, 1971, unless it qualified as an export trade corporation for any taxable year beginning before such date. In addition, if a corporation fails to qualify as an export trade corporation for a period of any 3 consecutive taxable years beginning after October 31, 1971, then for any taxable year beginning after such 3-year period, such corporation shall not be included within the term ``export trade corporation''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Three-year period. The period referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is the 3-year period ending with the close of the controlled foreign corporation's current taxable year, or such part of such 3-year period as occurs on and after the beginning of the corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, whichever period is shorter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gross income requirements. The conditions referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are that the controlled foreign corporation derives--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 percent or more of its gross income from sources without the United States, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> 75 percent of more of its gross income from transactions, activities, or interest described in section 971(b) and paragraph (b) of this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> 50 percent or more of its gross income from transactions, activities, or interest described in section 971(b) and paragraph (b) of this section in respect of agricultural products grown in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination of sources of gross income. The sources of gross income of a controlled foreign corporation shall be determined for purposes of subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph in accordance with the rules for determining sources of gross income set forth in sections 861 through 864 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Export trade income--(1) General rule. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade income'' means the gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation derived from transactions, activities, or interest described in subdivisions (i) through (vii) of this subparagraph, less deductions allowed under subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade income'' means the gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation derived from transactions, activities, or interest described in subdivisions (i) through (vii) of this subparagraph, less deductions allowed under subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sale of export property. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross income it derives from the sale of export property (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) which it purchases, if the sale is made to an unrelated person for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States. See section 971(b)(1). As a general rule, property will be presumed to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the country of destination of the sale. However, if at the time of the sale the controlled foreign corporation knows, or should

have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the sales transaction, that the property will probably be used, consumed, or disposed of in the United States, such property will be presumed to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States unless the controlled foreign corporation establishes that such property was used, consumed, or disposed of outside the United States. For purposes of this subdivision, export property must be sold by a controlled foreign corporation in essentially the same form in which such property is purchased. Whether export property sold is in essentially the same form in which such property is purchased shall be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in each case. Storage, handling, transportation, packaging, or servicing of property will be considered not to alter the form in which property is purchased. However, manufacture or production, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 1.954-3, will be considered to alter the form in which property is purchased and no part of the gross income from the sale of such property will be treated as export trade income. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the laws of foreign country Y, purchases articles manufactured in the United States from domestic corporation M and sells them in the form in which purchased to foreign corporation B, unrelated to A Corporation, for use in foreign countries, X, Y, and Z. The gross income of A Corporation from the purchase and sale of the articles constitutes gross export trade income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commissions and other income derived in connection with the sale of export property. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross commissions, fees, compensation, or other income derived by such corporation from the performance for any person of commercial, industrial, financial, technical, scientific, managerial, engineering, architectural, skilled, or other services in respect of a sale by such corporation in a transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or in respect of the sale by any other person of export property to a person unrelated to the controlled foreign corporation for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States. Such gross export trade income includes payments received for surveys made prior to, and in connection with, the sale of such export property (whether or not such sales are ultimately consummated). See section 971(b)(1). The term ``any person'' or ``any other person'' as used in this subdivision includes a related person as defined in section 954(d)(3) and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.954-1. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, receives from M Corporation a commission equal to 6 percent of the gross selling price of all personal property shipped by M Corporation as a result of services performed by A Corporation in soliciting orders in foreign countries X, Y, and Z. In fulfillment of such orders, M Corporation ships products manufactured by it in the United States. Corporation A does not assume title to the property sold. Gross commissions received by A Corporation from M Corporation in connection with the sale of such property to persons unrelated to A Corporation for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States constitute gross export trade income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation B, incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation N. Corporation N, is engaged in the business of manufacturing heavy duty electrical equipment in the United States. By contract, N Corporation engages B Corporation for the purpose of conducting engineering, technical, and financial studies required by N Corporation in the preparation of bids to supply foreign country Y with electrical equipment for a construction project to be undertaken by such country. Corporation N pays B Corporation a fee for the services, all of which are performed in country Y, which is based upon the number of hours of work performed without regard to whether a sale is ultimately consummated. Corporation N does not receive a contract from country Y on its bid to supply equipment. Income derived by B Corporation from performance of the service contract constitutes gross export trade income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commissions and other income derived in connection with the installation or maintenance of export property. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross commissions, fees, compensation, or other

income derived by such corporation from the performance for any person of commercial, industrial, financial, technical, scientific, managerial, engineering, architectural, skilled, or other services in respect of the installation or maintenance of export property which has been sold by such corporation in a transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or by any other person to a person unrelated to the controlled foreign corporation for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States. See section 971(b)(1). The term ``any person'' or ``any other person'' as used in this subdivision includes a related person as defined in section 954(d)(3) and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.954-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Commissions and other income derived in connection with the use of patents, copyrights, and other like property. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross commissions, fees, compensation, or other income derived by such corporation from the performance for any person of commercial, industrial, financial, technical, scientific, managerial, engineering, architectural, skilled, or other services in connection with the use outside of the United States by an unrelated person of patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, and other like property, including gross income derived from obtaining licensees for patents, but only if the patent, copyright, or other like property is acquired, or developed, and owned by the manufacturer, producer, grower, or extractor of any export property, in respect of which the controlled foreign corporation also derives gross export trade income within the meaning of subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph. See section 971(b)(2). The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation A incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation M. Corporation M, the owner of a patent registered in foreign country X, grants B Corporation, a corporation unrelated to A Corporation, the right to use such patent in foreign country Y in exchange for payment of a royalty. By a separate contract with B Corporation, A Corporation agrees for a gross fee of $100,000 to furnish, by maintaining a staff of technical representatives at the offices of B Corporation, technical services to B Corporation in connection with B Corporation's use of the patent. Corporation A also derives export trade income from the sale of export property which it purchases from M Corporation, the manufacturer of such property, and sells to C Corporation, an unrelated person, for use in country Y by C Corporation. The gross fee of $100,000 received by A Corporation for the furnishing of technical services in connection with B Corporation's use of M Corporation's patent constitutes gross export trade income since the service for which the fee is paid is performed in connection with the use outside the United States by an unrelated person (B Corporation) of a patent owned by a manufacturer (M Corporation) of export property in respect of which the controlled foreign corporation (A Corporation) derives gross export trade income from the sale to an unrelated person (C Corporation) for use outside the United States of export property purchased by it from the manufacturer (M Corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Income attributable to use of export property by an unrelated person. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross commissions, fees, rents, compensation, or other income which is received by such corporation from an unrelated person and is attributable to the use of export property by such unrelated person. See section 971(b)(3). The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation A, incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation M. Corporation A acquires by purchase bottling machines manufactured in the United States and leases the machines to B Corporation, a corporation unrelated to A Corporation, for use by B Corporation in foreign country Y. Gross rental income of A Corporation from the lease of the machines to B Corporation constitutes gross export trade income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Income attributable to the use of export property in the rendition of technical, scientific, or engineering services--(a) General. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes gross commissions, fees, compensation, or other income which is received by such corporation from an unrelated person and is attributable to

the use of export property in the performance of technical, scientific, or engineering services to such unrelated person. See section 971(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rule of apportionment. If a commission, fee, or other income received by a controlled foreign corporation from an unrelated person under a contract or arrangement for the performance of technical, scientific, or engineering services is not solely attributable to the use of export property in the performance of such services and the amount of the gross income attributable to such use of export property cannot be established by reference to transactions between other unrelated persons, such gross income shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to total gross income from the contract or arrangement as the cost of the export property consumed in the performance of such services, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation with respect to the export property so used, bears to the total costs and expenses attributable to the production of income under the contract or arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustration. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation A, incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation M. Corporation A is engaged in the seismograph service business in foreign country X. In an effort to establish the probable existence of oil in a concession area it owns in foreign country Y, B Corporation which is unrelated to A Corporation enters into a contract with A Corporation whereby A Corporation is required to make seismographic tests of the area in country Y for a fixed fee of $100,000. In performance of the contract, A Corporation hires a skilled crew to carry out the contract and utilizes equipment and supplies (for example, trucks, seismographic equipment, etc.) which constitute export property. Corporation A cannot establish by reference to transactions between other unrelated persons, the income attributable to the use of the export property in the performance of the contract. Corporation A's total costs and expenses (for example, salaries of the crew, administrative expenses, all supplies, total depreciation on property used in performance of the contract, etc.) incurred in performance of the contract are $80,000. The cost of export property consumed in performance of the contract (for example, dynamite, motor oil, and other supplies which were produced in the United States, reasonable depreciation on trucks and seismographic equipment manufactured in the United States and used in performance of the contract, etc.) is $30,000. Corporation A's gross export trade income from the contract is $37,500, that is, the amount which bears the same ratio to total gross income from the contract ($100,000) as the cost of the export property consumed in the rendition of the services ($30,000) bears to total costs and expenses attributable to the contract ($80,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Interest from export trade assets. Gross export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation includes interest derived by it from export trade assets described in section 971(c)(4) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section. See section 971(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Deductions to be taken into account. Export trade income of a controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be the amount determined by deducting from the items or categories of gross income described in subdivisions (i) through (vii) of this subparagraph the entire amount of those expenses, taxes, and other deductions properly allocable to such items or categories of income. For purposes of this section, expenses, taxes, and other deductions shall first be allocated to items or categories of gross income to which they directly relate; then, expenses, taxes, and other deductions which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or category of gross income shall be ratably apportioned among all items or categories of gross income, except that no expense, tax, or other deduction shall be allocated to an item or category of income to which it clearly does not apply and no deduction allowable to such controlled foreign corporation under section 882(c) and the regulations thereunder shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cross reference. For rules governing the determination of gross income and taxable income of a foreign corporation, see Sec. 1.952-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Export trade assets--(1) In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade assets'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export trade assets'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Working capital reasonably necessary for the production of export trade income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inventory of export property held for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Facilities located outside the United States for the storage, handling, transportation, packaging, servicing, sale, or distribution of export property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Evidences of indebtedness executed by unrelated persons in connection with payment for purchases of export property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States, or in connection with the payment for services described in section 971(b)(2) or (3) and paragraph (b)(1)(iv), (v), or (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Working capital. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, working capital of a controlled foreign corporation is the excess of its current assets over its current liabilities. Liabilities maturing in one year or less shall be considered current liabilities. A determination of the amount of working capital of a controlled foreign corporation which is reasonably necessary for the production of export trade income will depend upon the nature and volume of the activities of the controlled foreign corporation which produce export trade income as they exist on the applicable determination date. In determining working capital which is reasonably necessary for the production of export trade income, the anticipated future needs of the business will be taken into account to the extent that such needs relate to the year of the controlled foreign corporation following the applicable determination date; anticipated future needs relating to a later period will not be taken into account unless it is clearly established that such needs are reasonably related to the production of export trade income as of the applicable determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inventory of export property. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the inclusion of items in inventory shall be determined in accordance with rules applicable to domestic corporations. See Secs. 1.471-1 through 1.471-9. Inventory of export property of a controlled foreign corporation includes export property held for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States regardless of where it is located on the applicable determination date. Thus, such property may be physically located in the United States on such date. However, for property physically located in the United States to constitute export property, it must have been acquired by the controlled foreign corporation with a clear intent that it would dispose of the property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States. As a general rule, if during the year following the applicable determination date export property which was physically located in the United States on such date is actually exported for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States, such property will be deemed held for such purpose on the applicable determination date. On the other hand, the indefinite warehousing of export property in the United States by the controlled foreign corporation, or the subsequent sale of export property by such corporation for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States, will evidence a lack of intent by such corporation on the applicable determination date to hold such property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Facilities located outside the United States--(i) In general. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, a facility, as defined in subdivision (ii)(a) of this subparagraph, will be considered an export trade asset only--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If such facility is located outside the United States, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To the extent that such facility is used, within the meaning of subdivision (ii)(c) of this subparagraph, by the controlled foreign corporation for the storage, handling, transportation, packaging, servicing, sale, or distribution of export property in essentially the same form in which such property is acquired by such corporation.
Thus, a facility in which property is manufactured or produced, even though export property is used or consumed in the production or becomes a component part of the manufactured article, will not qualify as an export trade asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules--(a) Facility defined. For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term ``facility'' includes any asset or group of assets used

for the storage, handling, transportation, packaging, servicing, sale, or distribution of export property. Thus, such term includes warehouse, storage, or sales facilities (for example, sales office equipment), transportation equipment (for example, motor trucks, vessels, etc.), and machinery and equipment (for example, packaging equipment, servicing equipment, cranes, forklift trucks used in warehouses, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of location of transportation facilities. A transportation facility shall be considered to be located outside the United States for purposes of subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph if such property is predominantly located outside the United States. As a general rule, on an applicable determination date a transportation facility will be considered to be predominantly located outside the United States if 70 percent or more of the miles traversed (during the 12-month period immediately preceding such determination date or for such part of such period as such facility is owned by the controlled foreign corporation) in the use of such facility are traversed outside the United States or if such facility is located outside the United States at least 70 percent of the time during such period or such part thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of use. For purposes of subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph, the extent to which a facility is used in carrying on the activities described in such subdivision depends on the use made of the facility for the 12-month period immediately preceding the applicable determination date or for such part of such period as such facility is owned by the controlled foreign corporation. The method of measuring such use will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each case. However, such determinations of use will generally be made for a facility as a whole and not on the basis of individual items used in the operation of a facility. Thus, a determination as to the use of a warehouse facility will generally be made with respect to the entire facility and not separately for the items used in such warehouse, such as forklift trucks, storage bins, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Evidences of indebtedness. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph, the term ``evidence of indebtedness'' shall mean a note, installment sales contract, a time bill of exchange evidencing a sale on credit, or similar written instrument executed by an unrelated person which evidences the obligation of an unrelated person to pay for export property which an unrelated person purchases for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States or to pay for services described in section 971(b)(2) or (3) and paragraph (b)(1)(iv), (v), or (vi) of this section which are performed for an unrelated person. Receivables which arise out of the delivery of export property, or the performance of services, which are evidenced by invoices, bills of lading, bills of exchange which do not evidence a sale on credit, sales slips, and similar documents created by the unilateral act of a creditor shall not be considered evidences of indebtedness for purposes of section 971(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Duplication of treatment and priority of application. No asset which constitutes an export trade asset shall be taken into account more than once in determining the investments in export trade assets of a controlled foreign corporation. Assets which constitute working capital and also constitute inventory to which section 971(c)(2) applies or evidences of indebtedness to which section 971(c)(4) applies shall be taken into account in determining whether the amount of working capital of the controlled foreign corporation is reasonably necessary for the production of export trade income. However, to the extent that the amount of inventory to which section 971(c)(2) applies or evidences of indebtedness to which section 971(c)(4) applies is not included in working capital to which section 971(c)(1) applies on the ground that such amount is not reasonably necessary for the production of export trade income, the amount shall be included under section 971(c)(2) or 971(c)(4), as the case may be, in a controlled foreign corporation's investments in export trade assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Export promotion expenses--(1) In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export promotion

expenses'' means, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year by the controlled foreign corporation which are reasonably allocable to the receipt or production of export trade income including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export promotion

expenses'' means, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year by the controlled foreign corporation which are reasonably allocable to the receipt or production of export trade income including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered for such purpose,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rentals or other payments for the use of property actually used for such purpose, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence of property actually used for such purpose.
In determining for purposes of this subparagraph whether expenses are reasonably allocable to the receipt or production of export trade income, consideration shall be given to the facts and circumstances of each case. As a general rule, if export trade income results from the sale of export property, export promotion expenses allocable to such income shall include warehousing, advertising, selling, billing, collection, other administrative, and similar costs properly allocable to the marketing activity, but shall not include cost of goods sold, income or similar tax, any expense which does not advance the distribution or sale of export property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States, or any expense for which the controlled foreign corporation is reimbursed. If export trade income results from the rental of export property, export promotion expenses allocable to such income shall include a reasonable allowance for depreciation and servicing of such property, and the administrative and similar costs properly allocable to the rental activity. If export trade income results from the performance of services, export promotion expenses shall include a reasonable allowance for compensation of the persons performing services for the controlled foreign corporation in the execution of the service contract or arrangement and administrative expenses reasonably allocable to the service activity. In no case shall income taxes be included in export promotion expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expenses incurred within the United States. No expense incurred within the United States shall be treated as an export promotion expense for purposes of section 971(d) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph unless at least--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 percent of all salaries and other personal service compensation incurred in the receipt or the production of export trade income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 90 percent of rents and other payments for the use of property used in the receipt or the production of export trade income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 90 percent of the allowances for the exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence of property used in the receipt or the production of export trade income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 90 percent of all other ordinary and necessary expenses reasonably allocable to the receipt or the production of export trade income,
is incurred outside the United States. For this purpose, personal service compensation will be considered incurred at the place where the service is performed (for example, salaries will be considered incurred at the place where the employee works; payments for art work will be considered incurred at the place where the art work is prepared, etc.); rent, depreciation, and other expenses related to real or personal property will be considered incurred at the place where the property is located; and expenses for media advertising will be considered incurred at the place where the advertising is consumed. For such purpose, newspaper or periodical advertising will be considered consumed where the newspaper or periodical is principally distributed, and television and radio advertising will be considered consumed at the place where the audience is primarily located. Technicalities of contract or payment, for example, the place where a contract is executed or the location of a bank account from which payment is made, shall not be determinative of the place where an expense is incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Export property. For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1, inclusive, the term ``export property'' means property, or any interest in property, which is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States. Whether property

will be considered manufactured or produced in the United States will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. As a general rule, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The property sold, serviced, used, or rented by the controlled foreign corporation is substantially transformed in the United States prior to its export from the United States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operations conducted in the United States with respect to the property sold, serviced, used, or rented by the controlled foreign corporation, whether performed in the United States by one person or a series of persons in a chain of distribution, are substantial in nature and are generally considered to constitute the manufacture or production of property,
then the property sold, serviced, used, or rented will be considered to have been manufactured or produced in the United States.
