                                Sec. 375.405  How must I provide a non-binding estimate?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you do not provide a binding estimate to an individual  shipper in accordance with Sec. 375.403, you must provide a non-binding  written estimate to the individual shipper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you provide a non-binding estimate to an individual shipper,  you must provide your reasonably accurate estimate of the approximate  costs the individual shipper should expect to pay for the transportation  and services of the shipment. You must comply with the following ten  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must provide reasonably accurate non-binding estimates based  upon both the estimated weight or volume of the shipment and services  required and the physical survey of the household goods, if required. If  you provide a shipper with an estimate based on volume that will later  be converted to a weight-based rate, you must provide the shipper an  explanation in writing of the formula used to calculate the conversion  to weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must explain to the individual shipper that final charges  calculated for shipments moved on non-binding estimates will be those  appearing in your tariffs applicable to the transportation. You must  explain that these final charges may exceed the approximate costs  appearing in your estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must furnish non-binding estimates without charge and in  writing to the individual shipper or other person responsible for  payment of the freight charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must retain a copy of each non-binding estimate as an  attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must clearly indicate on the face of a non-binding estimate  that the estimate is not binding upon you and the charges shown are the  approximate charges to be assessed for the service identified in the  estimate. The estimate must clearly state that the shipper will not be  required to pay more than 110 percent of the non-binding estimate at the  time of delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must clearly describe on the face of a non-binding estimate  the entire shipment and all services you are providing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If it appears an individual shipper has tendered additional  household goods or requires additional services not identified in the  non-binding estimate, you are not required to honor the estimate. If an  agreement cannot be reached as to the price or service requirements for  the additional goods or services, you are not required to service the  shipment. However, if you do service the shipment, before loading the  shipment, you must do one of the following two things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reaffirm your non-binding estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Negotiate a revised written non-binding estimate accurately  listing, in detail, the additional household goods or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Once you load a shipment, failure to execute a new non-binding  estimate signifies you have reaffirmed the original non-binding  estimate. You may not collect more than 110 percent of the amount of the  original non-binding estimate at destination, except as provided in  paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If you believe additional services are necessary to properly  service a shipment after the bill of lading has been issued, you must  inform the individual shipper what the additional services are before  performing those services. You must allow the shipper at least one hour  to determine whether he or she wants the additional services performed.  If the individual shipper agrees to pay for the additional services, you  must execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the  bill of lading contract and have the individual shipper sign the written  attachment. This may be done through fax transmissions; e-mail;  overnight courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested. You must  bill the individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days  from delivery. If the individual shipper does not agree to pay the  additional services, the carrier should perform only those additional  services as are required to complete the delivery, and bill the  individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days from  delivery, except that you may collect at delivery charges for  impracticable operations that do not exceed 15 percent of all other  charges due at delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the individual shipper requests additional services after  the bill of lading has been issued, you must inform the individual  shipper of the additional charges involved. You may require full   payment at destination for these additional services and (unless you  make only a partial delivery, in which case you must collect a prorated  percentage of the original non-binding estimate as set forth in Sec.  375.407(c) of this part) for up to 110 percent of the original non- binding estimate. If applicable, you also may require payment at  delivery of charges for impracticable operations (as defined in your  carrier tariff) not to exceed 15 percent of all other charges due at  delivery. You must bill and collect from the individual shipper any  applicable charges not collected at delivery in accordance with subpart  H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you furnish a non-binding estimate, you must enter the  estimated charges upon the order for service and upon the bill of  lading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must retain a copy of the non-binding estimate for each move  you perform for at least one year from the date you made the estimate  and keep it as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of  lading contract.
