An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the presiding officer, or to present a motion under Sec. 502.203(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participating through written questions.
