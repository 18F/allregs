In determining  whether these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent  to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the  extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of  activity as the existing source should be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Construction on a site at which an existing source is located  results in a modification rather than a New Source if the construction  does not create a new building, structure, facility or installation  meeting the criteria of paragraphs (m)(1)(ii) or (m)(1)(iii) of this  section, but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or  production equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction of a new source as defined under this paragraph has  commenced if the owner or operator has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous onsite  construction program:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or  equipment; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Significant site preparation work including clearing,  excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities  which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new  source facilities or equipment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase  of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its  operation within a reasonable time.
