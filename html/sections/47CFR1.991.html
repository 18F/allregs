The Commission will presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the following interests satisfy this criterion for exemption from the specific approval requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Where the relevant licensee, controlling U.S. parent, or entity holding a direct or indirect equity and/or voting interest in the licensee or U.S. parent is a ``public company,'' as defined in Sec. 1.990(d)(9), provided that the foreign holder is an institutional investor that is eligible to report its beneficial ownership interests in the company's voting, equity securities in excess of 5 percent (not to exceed 10 percent) pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13d-1(b), 17 CFR 240.13d-1(b), or a substantially comparable foreign law or regulation. This presumption shall not apply if the foreign individual, entity or group holding such interests is obligated to report its holdings in the company pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13d-1(a), 17 CFR 240.13d-1(a), or a substantially comparable foreign law or regulation.</p><p class="depth5">Example. Common carrier applicant (``Applicant'') is preparing a petition for declaratory ruling to request Commission approval for foreign ownership of its controlling, U.S.-organized parent (``U.S. Parent'') to exceed the 25 percent benchmark in section 310(b)(4) of the Act. Applicant does not currently hold any FCC licenses. Shares of U.S. Parent trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on a shareholder survey and a review of its shareholder records, U.S. Parent has determined that its aggregate foreign ownership on any given day may exceed an aggregate 25 percent, including a six percent common stock interest held by a foreign-organized mutual fund (``Foreign Fund''). U.S. Parent has confirmed that Foreign Fund is not currently required to report its interest pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13d-1(a) and instead is eligible to report its interest pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13d-1(b). U.S. Parent also has confirmed that Foreign Fund does not hold any other interests in U.S. Parent's equity securities, whether of a class of voting or non-voting securities. Applicant may, but is not required to, request specific approval of Foreign Fund's six percent interest in U.S. Parent.</p><p class="depth5">Note to paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A):</p><p class="depth5">Where an institutional investor holds voting, equity securities that are subject to reporting under Exchange Act Rule 13d-1, 17 CFR 240.13d-1, or a substantially comparable foreign law or regulation, and equity securities that are not subject to such reporting the investor's total capital stock interests may be aggregated and treated as exempt from the 5 percent specific approval requirement in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section so long as the aggregate amount of the institutional investor's holdings does not exceed ten percent of the company's total capital stock or voting rights and the investor is eligible to certify under Exchange Act Rule 13d-1(b), 17 CFR 240.13d-1(b), or a substantially comparable foreign law or regulation that it has

acquired its capital stock interests in the ordinary course of business and not with the purpose nor with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the company. In calculating foreign equity and voting interests, the Commission does not consider convertible interests such as options, warrants and convertible debentures until converted, unless specifically requested by the petitioner, i.e., where the petitioner is requesting approval so those rights can be exercised in a particular case without further Commission approval.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Where the relevant licensee, controlling U.S. parent, or entity holding a direct and/or indirect equity and/or voting interest in the licensee or U.S. parent is a ``privately held'' corporation, as defined in Sec. 1.990(d)(8), provided that a shareholders' agreement, or similar voting agreement, prohibits the foreign holder from becoming actively involved in the management or operation of the corporation and limits the foreign holder's voting and consent rights, if any, to the minority shareholder protections listed in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Where the relevant licensee, controlling U.S. parent, or entity holding a direct and/or indirect equity and/or voting interest in the licensee or U.S. parent is ``privately held,'' as defined in Sec. 1.990(d)(8), and is organized as a limited partnership, limited liability company (``LLC''), or limited liability partnership (``LLP''), provided that the foreign holder is ``insulated'' in accordance with the criteria specified in Sec. 1.993.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A petitioner may, but is not required to, request specific approval for any other foreign individual or entity that holds, or would hold, a direct and/or indirect equity and/or voting interest in the controlling U.S. parent (for petitions filed under Sec. 1.990(a)(1)) or in the petitioning applicant or licensee (for petitions filed under Sec. 1.990(a)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The minority shareholder protections referenced in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(B) of this section consist of the following rights:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or liquidation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The power to prevent the corporation from entering into contracts with majority shareholders or their affiliates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The power to prevent the corporation from guaranteeing the obligations of majority shareholders or their affiliates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The power to purchase an additional interest in the corporation to prevent the dilution of the shareholder's pro rata interest in the event that the corporation issues additional instruments conveying shares in the company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The power to prevent the change of existing legal rights or preferences of the shareholders, as provided in the charter, by-laws or other operative governance documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The power to prevent the amendment of the charter, by-laws or other operative governance documents of the company with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (i)(5)(i) through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Commission reserves the right to consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether voting or consent rights over matters other than those listed in paragraph (i)(5) of this section shall be considered permissible minority shareholder protections in a particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For each foreign individual or entity named in response to paragraph (i) of this section, provide the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an individual, his or her citizenship and principal business(es);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a business organization:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its place of organization, type of business organization (e.g., corporation, unincorporated association, trust, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust, other (include description of legal entity)), and principal business(es);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of any individual or entity that holds, or would hold, directly and/or indirectly, through one or more intervening entities, 10 percent or more of the equity interests and/or voting interests, or a controlling interest, in the foreign entity for which the petitioner requests specific approval. Specify for each such interest holder, his or her citizenship (for individuals) or place of legal organization (for entities). Equity

interests and voting interests held indirectly shall be calculated in accordance with the principles set forth in Sec. 1.992.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where no individual or entity holds, or would hold, directly and/or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the equity interests and/or voting interests, or a controlling interest, the petition shall specify that no individual or entity holds, or would hold, directly and/or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the equity interests and/or voting interests, or a controlling interest, in the foreign entity for which the petitioner requests specific approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Requests for advance approval. The petitioner may, but is not required to, request advance approval in its petition for any foreign individual or entity named in response to paragraph (i) of this section to increase its direct and/or indirect equity and/or voting interests in the controlling U.S. parent of the common carrier or aeronautical radio station licensee, for petitions filed under Sec. 1.990(a)(1), and/or in the common carrier licensee, for petitions filed under Sec. 1.990(a)(2), above the percentages specified in response to paragraph (i) of this section.

The petitioner shall specify for the named controlling foreign individual(s) or entity(ies) the maximum percentages of equity and/or voting interests for which advance approval is sought or, in lieu of a specific amount, state that the petitioner requests advance approval for the named controlling foreign individual or entity to increase its interests up to and including 100 percent of the U.S. parent's direct and/or indirect equity and/or voting interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Petitions filed under Sec. 1.990(a)(1) and/or Sec. 1.990(a)(2).
