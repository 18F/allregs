                            <p class="depth0">The Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (Sanctuary) boundary encompasses a total area of approximately 399 square nautical miles (nmi) of ocean waters, and submerged lands

thereunder, off the northern coast of California approximately 50 miles west-northwest of San Francisco, California. The Sanctuary boundary extends westward (approximately 250 degrees) from the northwestern most point of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) to the 1,000 fathom isobath northwest of Cordell Bank. The Sanctuary boundary then generally follows this isobath in a southerly direction to the western-most point of the GFNMS boundary. The Sanctuary boundary then follows the GFNMS boundary again to the northwestern corner of the GFNMS. The exact boundary coordinates are listed in appendix A to this subpart.</p>
