                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A partnership may adjust the basis of partnership  property under sections 734(b) and 743(b) if it files an election in  accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. An  election may not be filed to make the adjustments provided in either  section 734(b) or section 743(b) alone, but such an election must apply  to both sections. An election made under the provisions of this section  shall apply to all property distributions and transfers of partnership  interests taking place in the partnership taxable year for which the  election is made and in all subsequent partnership taxable years unless  the election is revoked pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and method of making election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An election under  section 754 and this section to adjust the basis of partnership property  under sections 734(b) and 743(b), with respect to a distribution of  property to a partner or a transfer of an interest in a partnership,  shall be made in a written statement filed with the partnership return  for the taxable year during which the distribution or transfer occurs.  For the election to be valid, the return must be filed not later than  the time prescribed by paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.6031-1 (including  extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year (or  before August 23, 1956, whichever is later). Notwithstanding the  preceding two sentences, if a valid election has been made under section  754 and this section for a preceding taxable year and not revoked  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, a new election is not  required to be made. The statement required by this subparagraph shall  (i) set forth the name and address of the partnership making the  election, (ii) be signed by any one of the partners, and (iii) contain a  declaration that the partnership elects under section 754 to apply the  provisions of section 734(b) and section 743(b). For rules regarding  extensions of time for filing elections, see Sec. 1.9100-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. A, a U.S. citizen, is a member of partnership ABC, which  has not previously made an election under section 754 to adjust the  basis of partnership property. The partnership and the partners use the  calendar year as the taxable year. A sells his interest in the  partnership to D on January 1, 1971. The partnership may elect under  section 754 and this section to adjust the basis of partnership property  under sections 734(b) and 743(b). Unless an extension of time to make  the election is obtained under the provisions of Sec. 1.9100-1, the  election must be made in a written statement filed with the partnership  return for 1971 and must contain the information specified in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Such return must be filed by April  17, 1972 (unless an extension of time for filing the return is  obtained). The election will apply to all distributions of property to a  partner and transfers of an interest in the partnership occurring in  1971 and subsequent years, unless revoked pursuant to paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revocation of election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A partnership having an  election in effect under this section may revoke such election with the  approval of the district director for the internal revenue district in  which the partnership return is required to be filed. A partnership  which wishes to revoke such an election shall file with the district  director for the internal revenue district in which the partnership  return is required to be filed an application setting forth the grounds  on which the revocation is desired. The application shall be filed not  later than 30 days after the close of the partnership taxable year with  respect to which revocation is intended to take effect and shall   be signed by any one of the partners. Examples of situations which may  be considered sufficient reason for approving an application for  revocation include a change in the nature of the partnership business, a  substantial increase in the assets of the partnership, a change in the  character of partnership assets, or an increased frequency of  retirements or shifts of partnership interests, so that an increased  administrative burden would result to the partnership from the election.  However, no application for revocation of an election shall be approved  when the purpose of the revocation is primarily to avoid stepping down  the basis of partnership assets upon a transfer or distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.''
