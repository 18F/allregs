                            <p class="depth0">You must follow the SE prevention measures set forth in this  section. In addition, you must have and implement a written SE  prevention plan that is specific to each farm where you produce eggs and  that includes, at a minimum, the following SE prevention measures:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pullets. You must procure pullets that are SE monitored or raise  pullets under SE monitored conditions. ``SE monitored'' means the  pullets are raised under SE control conditions that prevent SE,  including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procurement of chicks. Chicks are procured from SE-monitored  breeder flocks that meet the National Poultry Improvement Plan's  standards for ``U.S. S. Enteritidis Clean'' status (9 CFR 145.23(d)) or  equivalent standard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Environmental testing. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pullet environment is tested for  SE when pullets are 14 to 16 weeks of age;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the environmental test required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section is negative, you do not need to perform any additional  testing of those birds or their environment until the environmental test  at 40 to 45 weeks of age specified in Sec. 118.5(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the environmental test required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section is positive, you must begin egg testing, as specified in  Sec. 118.6, within 2 weeks of the start of egg laying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cleaning and disinfection. If the environmental test required in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section is positive, the pullet environment is  cleaned and disinfected, to include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Removal of all visible manure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dry cleaning the positive pullet house to remove dust,  feathers, and old feed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Following cleaning, disinfection of the positive pullet house  with spray, aerosol, fumigation, or another appropriate disinfection  method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Biosecurity. As part of this program, you must take steps to  ensure that there is no introduction or transfer of SE into or among  poultry houses. Among such biosecurity measures you must, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit visitors on the farm and in the poultry houses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain practices that will protect against cross contamination  when equipment is moved among poultry houses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain practices that will protect against cross contamination  when persons move between poultry houses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prevent stray poultry, wild birds, cats, and other animals from  entering poultry houses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not allow employees to keep birds at home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rodents, flies, and other pest control. As part of this program,  you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitor for rodents by visual inspection and mechanical traps or  glueboards or another appropriate monitoring method and, when monitoring  indicates unacceptable rodent activity within a poultry house, use  appropriate methods to achieve satisfactory rodent control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monitor for flies by spot cards, Scudder grills, or sticky traps  or another appropriate monitoring method and, when monitoring indicates  unacceptable fly activity within a poultry house, use appropriate  methods to achieve satisfactory fly control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remove debris within a poultry house and vegetation and debris  outside a poultry house that may provide harborage for pests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cleaning and disinfection. You must clean and disinfect the  poultry house according to these procedures before new laying hens are  added to the house, if you have had an environmental test or an egg test  that was positive for SE at any point during the life of a flock that  was housed in the poultry house prior to depopulation. As part of the  cleaning and disinfection procedures, you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remove all visible manure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dry clean the positive poultry house to remove dust, feathers,  and old feed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following cleaning, disinfect the positive poultry house with  spray, aerosol, fumigation, or another appropriate disinfection method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refrigeration. You must hold and transport eggs at or below 45  F ambient temperature beginning 36 hours after time of lay. If the eggs  are to be processed as table eggs and are not processed for the ultimate  consumer within 36 hours from the time of lay and, therefore, are held  and transported as required at or below 45 F ambient temperature, then  you may then hold them at room temperature for no more than 36 hours  just prior to processing to allow an equilibration step to temper the  eggs.</p>
