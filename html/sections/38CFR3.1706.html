VA will pay up to the maximum burial allowance specified in 38 U.S.C. 2303(a) for the burial and funeral expenses of a veteran described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. A burial allowance is payable under this section for a veteran whose death was not service-connected and who died while hospitalized by VA. For purposes of this allowance, a veteran was hospitalized by VA if the veteran:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was properly admitted to a VA facility (as described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(3)) for hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1710 or 1711(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was transferred or admitted to a non-VA facility (as described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(4)) for hospital care under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1703;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Was transferred or admitted to a nursing home for nursing home care at the expense of the U.S. under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1720;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Was transferred or admitted to a State nursing home for nursing home care for which payment is authorized under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1741;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Was traveling under proper prior authorization, and at VA expense, to or from a specified place for purpose of examination, treatment, or care; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Was hospitalized by VA pursuant to any of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section but was not at the facility at the time of death and was:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On authorized absence that did not exceed 96 hours at the time of death;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On unauthorized absence for a period not in excess of 24 hours at the time of death; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Absent from the facility for a period not in excess of 24 hours of combined authorized and unauthorized absence at the time of death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hospitalization in the Philippines.
