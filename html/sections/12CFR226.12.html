                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Issuance of credit cards. Regardless of the purpose for which a  credit card is to be used, including business, commercial, or  agricultural use, no credit card shall be issued to any person except--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In response to an oral or written request or application for the  card; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a renewal of, or substitute for, an accepted credit card.\21\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\21\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Liability of cardholder for unauthorized use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition  of unauthorized use. For purposes of this section, the term  ``unauthorized use'' means the use of a credit card by a person, other  than the cardholder, who does not have actual, implied, or apparent  authority for such use, and from which the cardholder receives no  benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on amount. The liability of a cardholder for  unauthorized use \22\ of a credit card shall not exceed the lesser of  $50 or the amount of money, property, labor, or services obtained by the  unauthorized use before notification to the card issuer under paragraph  (b)(3) of this section. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\22\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conditions of liability. A cardholder shall be liable for  unauthorized use of a credit card only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The credit card is an accepted credit card;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The card issuer has provided adequate notice \23\ of the  cardholder's maximum potential liability and of means by which the card  issuer may be notified of loss or theft of the card. The notice shall  state that the cardholder's liability shall not exceed $50 (or any  lesser amount) and that the cardholder may give oral or written  notification, and shall describe a means of notification (for example, a  telephone number, an address, or both); and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\23\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The card issuer has provided a means to identify the  cardholder on the account or the authorized user of the card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notification to card issuer. Notification to a card issuer is  given when steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the  ordinary course of business to provide the card issuer with the  pertinent information about the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized  use of a credit card, regardless of whether any particular officer,  employee, or agent of the card issuer does, in fact, receive the  information. Notification may be given, at the option of the person  giving it, in person, by telephone, or in writing. Notification in  writing is considered given at the time of receipt or, whether or not  received, at the expiration of the time ordinarily required for  transmission, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of other applicable law or agreement. If state law or an  agreement between a cardholder and the card issuer imposes lesser  liability than that provided in this paragraph, the lesser liability  shall govern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Business use of credit cards. If 10 or more credit cards are  issued by one card issuer for use by the employees of an organization,  this section does not prohibit the card issuer and the organization from  agreeing to liability for unauthorized use without regard to this  section. However, liability for unauthorized use may be imposed on an  employee of the organization, by either   the card issuer or the organization, only in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Right of cardholder to assert claims or defenses against card  issuer\24\--(1) General rule. When a person who honors a credit card  fails to resolve satisfactorily a dispute as to property or services  purchased with the credit card in a consumer credit transaction, the  cardholder may assert against the card issuer all claims (other than  tort claims) and defenses arising out of the transaction and relating to  the failure to resolve the dispute. The cardholder may withhold payment  up to the amount of credit outstanding for the property or services that  gave rise to the dispute and any finance or other charges imposed on  that amount.\25\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\24\ [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">\25\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adverse credit reports prohibited. If, in accordance with  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the cardholder withholds payment of  the amount of credit outstanding for the disputed transaction, the card  issuer shall not report that amount as delinquent until the dispute is  settled or judgment is rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. The rights stated in paragraphs (c)(1)  and (c)(2) of this section apply only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The cardholder has made a good faith attempt to resolve the  dispute with the person honoring the credit card; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of credit extended to obtain the property or services  that result in the assertion of the claim or defense by the cardholder  exceeds $50, and the disputed transaction occurred in the same state as  the cardholder's current designated address or, if not within the same  state, within 100 miles from that address.\26\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\26\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusion. The limitations stated in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of  this section shall not apply when the person honoring the credit card:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is the same person as the card issuer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is controlled by the card issuer directly or indirectly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is under the direct or indirect control of a third person that  also directly or indirectly controls the card issuer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Controls the card issuer directly or indirectly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Is a franchised dealer in the card issuer's products or  services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Has obtained the order for the disputed transaction through a  mail solicitation made or participated in by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Offsets by card issuer prohibited. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A card issuer may not  take any action, either before or after termination of credit card  privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a  consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against  funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph does not alter or affect the right of a card  issuer acting under state or federal law to do any of the following with  regard to funds of a cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer if  the same procedure is constitutionally available to creditors generally:  Obtain or enforce a consensual security interest in the funds; attach or  otherwise levy upon the funds; or obtain or enforce a court order  relating to the funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph does not prohibit a plan, if authorized in  writing by the cardholder, under which the card issuer may periodically  deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit  account held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations in  Sec. 226.13(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Prompt notification of returns and crediting of refunds. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  When a creditor other than the card issuer accepts the return of  property or forgives a debt for services that is to be reflected as a  credit to the consumer's credit card account, that creditor shall,  within 7 business days from accepting the return or forgiving the debt,  transmit a credit statement to the card issuer through the card issuer's  normal channels for credit statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The card issuer shall, within 3 business days from receipt of a  credit statement, credit the consumer's account with the amount of the  refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a creditor other than a card issuer routinely gives cash  refunds to consumers paying in cash, the creditor shall also give credit  or cash refunds to consumers using credit cards, unless it discloses at  the time the transaction is   consummated that credit or cash refunds for returns are not given. This  section does not require refunds for returns nor does it prohibit  refunds in kind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Discounts; tie-in arrangements. No card issuer may, by contract  or otherwise:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prohibit any person who honors a credit card from offering a  discount to a consumer to induce the consumer to pay by cash, check, or  similar means rather than by use of a credit card or its underlying  account for the purchase of property or services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Require any person who honors the card issuer's credit card to  open or maintain any account or obtain any other service not essential  to the operation of the credit card plan from the card issuer or any  other person, as a condition of participation in a credit card plan. If  maintenance of an account for clearing purposes is determined to be  essential to the operation of the credit card plan, it may be required  only if no service charges or minimum balance requirements are imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Relation to Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E. For  guidance on whether Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) or Regulation E (12  CFR part 205) applies in instances involving both credit and electronic  fund transfer aspects, refer to Regulation E, 12 CFR 205.12(a) regarding  issuance and liability for unauthorized use. On matters other than  issuance and liability, this section applies to the credit aspects of  combined credit/electronic fund transfer transactions, as applicable.  [75 FR 7812, Feb. 22, 2010]</p>
