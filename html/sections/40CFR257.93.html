                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The groundwater monitoring program must include consistent  sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure monitoring  results that provide an accurate representation of groundwater quality  at the background and downgradient wells required by Sec. 257.91. The  owner or operator of the CCR unit must develop a sampling and analysis  program that includes procedures and techniques for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sample collection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sample preservation and shipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Analytical procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Chain of custody control; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Quality assurance and quality control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The groundwater monitoring program must include sampling and  analytical methods that are appropriate for groundwater sampling and  that accurately measure hazardous constituents and other monitoring  parameters in groundwater samples. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 257.90  through 257.98, the term constituent refers to both hazardous  constituents and other monitoring parameters listed in either appendix  III or IV of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Groundwater elevations must be measured in each well immediately  prior to purging, each time groundwater is sampled. The owner or  operator of the CCR unit must determine the rate and direction of  groundwater flow each time groundwater is sampled. Groundwater  elevations in wells which monitor the same CCR management area must be  measured within a period of time short enough to avoid temporal  variations in groundwater flow which could preclude accurate  determination of groundwater flow rate and direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must establish background  groundwater quality in a hydraulically upgradient or background well(s)  for each of the constituents required in the particular groundwater  monitoring program that applies to the CCR unit as determined under  Sec. 257.94(a) or Sec. 257.95(a). Background groundwater quality may  be established at wells that are not located hydraulically upgradient  from the CCR unit if it meets the requirements of Sec. 257.91(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The number of samples collected when conducting detection  monitoring and assessment monitoring (for both downgradient and  background wells) must be consistent with the statistical procedures  chosen under paragraph (f) of this section and the performance standards  under paragraph (g) of this section. The sampling procedures shall be  those specified under Sec. 257.94(b) through (d) for detection  monitoring,   Sec. 257.95(b) through (d) for assessment monitoring, and Sec.  257.96(b) for corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> through (5) of this  section to be used in evaluating groundwater monitoring data for each  specified constituent. The statistical test chosen shall be conducted  separately for each constituent in each monitoring well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A parametric analysis of variance followed by multiple  comparison procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of  contamination. The method must include estimation and testing of the  contrasts between each compliance well's mean and the background mean  levels for each constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An analysis of variance based on ranks followed by multiple  comparison procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of  contamination. The method must include estimation and testing of the  contrasts between each compliance well's median and the background  median levels for each constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A tolerance or prediction interval procedure, in which an  interval for each constituent is established from the distribution of  the background data and the level of each constituent in each compliance  well is compared to the upper tolerance or prediction limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A control chart approach that gives control limits for each  constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Another statistical test method that meets the performance  standards of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a  certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the  selected statistical method is appropriate for evaluating the  groundwater monitoring data for the CCR management area. The  certification must include a narrative description of the statistical  method selected to evaluate the groundwater monitoring data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any statistical method chosen under paragraph (f) of this  section shall comply with the following performance standards, as  appropriate, based on the statistical test method used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The statistical method used to evaluate groundwater monitoring  data shall be appropriate for the distribution of constituents. Normal  distributions of data values shall use parametric methods. Non-normal  distributions shall use non-parametric methods. If the distribution of  the constituents is shown by the owner or operator of the CCR unit to be  inappropriate for a normal theory test, then the data must be  transformed or a distribution-free (non-parametric) theory test must be  used. If the distributions for the constituents differ, more than one  statistical method may be needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an individual well comparison procedure is used to compare an  individual compliance well constituent concentration with background  constituent concentrations or a groundwater protection standard, the  test shall be done at a Type I error level no less than 0.01 for each  testing period. If a multiple comparison procedure is used, the Type I  experiment wise error rate for each testing period shall be no less than  0.05; however, the Type I error of no less than 0.01 for individual well  comparisons must be maintained. This performance standard does not apply  to tolerance intervals, prediction intervals, or control charts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a control chart approach is used to evaluate groundwater  monitoring data, the specific type of control chart and its associated  parameter values shall be such that this approach is at least as  effective as any other approach in this section for evaluating  groundwater data. The parameter values shall be determined after  considering the number of samples in the background data base, the data  distribution, and the range of the concentration values for each  constituent of concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a tolerance interval or a predictional interval is used to  evaluate groundwater monitoring data, the levels of confidence and, for  tolerance intervals, the percentage of the population that the interval  must contain, shall be such that this approach is at least as effective  as any other approach in this section for evaluating groundwater data.  These parameters shall be determined after considering the number of  samples in the background data base, the data distribution, and the   range of the concentration values for each constituent of concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The statistical method must account for data below the limit of  detection with one or more statistical procedures that shall at least as  effective as any other approach in this section for evaluating  groundwater data. Any practical quantitation limit that is used in the  statistical method shall be the lowest concentration level that can be  reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy  during routine laboratory operating conditions that are available to the  facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If necessary, the statistical method must include procedures to  control or correct for seasonal and spatial variability as well as  temporal correlation in the data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must determine whether or  not there is a statistically significant increase over background values  for each constituent required in the particular groundwater monitoring  program that applies to the CCR unit, as determined under Sec.  257.94(a) or Sec. 257.95(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> to the background value of that constituent,  according to the statistical procedures and performance standards  specified under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 90 days after completing sampling and analysis, the owner  or operator must determine whether there has been a statistically  significant increase over background for any constituent at each  monitoring well.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must measure ``total recoverable metals''  concentrations in measuring groundwater quality. Measurement of total  recoverable metals captures both the particulate fraction and dissolved  fraction of metals in natural waters. Groundwater samples shall not be  field-filtered prior to analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the  recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. 257.105(h), the  notification requirements specified in Sec. 257.106(h), and the  Internet requirements specified in Sec. 257.107(h).</p>
