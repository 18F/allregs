                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The phrase to commence construction means to engage in a continuous program of on-site construction including site clearance, grading, dredging, or land filling specifically designed for a parking facility in preparation for the fabrication, erection, or installation of the building components of the facility. For the purpose of this paragraph, interruptions resulting from acts of God, strikes, litigation, or other matters beyond the control of the owner shall be disregarded in determining whether a construction or modification program is continuous.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The phrase to commence modification means to engage in a continuous program of on-site modification including site clearance, grading, dredging, or land filling in preparation for a specific modification of the parking facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The phrase commercial parking space means a space used for parking a vehicle in a commercial parking facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercial parking facility (also called facility) means any lot, garage, building or structure, or combination or portion thereof, on or in which motor vehicles are temporarily parked for a fee, excluding (i) a parking facility, the use of which is limited exclusively to residents (and guests of residents) of a residential building or group of buildings under common control, and (ii) parking on public streets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Freeze means to maintain at all times after October 15, 1973, the total quantity of commercial parking spaces available for use at the same amounts as were available for use prior to said date; Provided, That such quantity may be increased by spaces the construction of which commenced prior to October 15, 1973, or as specifically permitted by paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of this section; provided further that such additional spaces do not result in an increase of more than 10 percent in the total commercial parking spaces available for use on October 15, 1973, in any municipality within the freeze area or at Logan International Airport (``Logan Airport''). For purposes of the last clause of the previous sentence, the 10 percent limit shall apply to each municipality and Logan Airport separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> There is hereby established a freeze, as defined by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, on the availability of commercial parking facilities in the freeze area effective October 15, 1973. In the event construction in any municipality, commenced prior to October 15, 1973, results in a number of spaces which exceeds the 10 percent limit prescribed by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the Governor shall immediately take all necessary steps to assure that the available commercial

spaces within such municipality shall be reduced to comply with the freeze. In the event that such limit is exceeded at Logan Airport, then the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> After August 15, 1973, no person shall commence construction of any commercial parking facility or modification of any such existing facility in the freeze area unless and until he has obtained from the Governor or from an agency approved by the Governor a permit stating that construction or modification of such facility will be in compliance with the parking freeze established by paragraph (c) of this section. This paragraph shall not apply to any proposed parking facility for which a general construction contract was finally executed by all appropriate parties on or before August 15, 1973.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Governor shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 10 days of approval of any agency pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. In order for any agency to be approved by the Governor for purposes of issuing permits pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, such agency shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Governor that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for permit application and issuance have been established. Such requirements shall include but not be limited to a condition that before a permit may be issued the following findings of fact or factually supported projections must be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The location of the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total motor vehicle capacity before and after the proposed construction or modification of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Criteria for issuance of permits have been established and published. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full consideration of all facts contained in the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provisions that no permit will be issued if construction or modification of the facility will not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agency procedures provide that no permit for the construction or modification of a facility covered by this section shall be issued without notice and opportunity for public hearing. The public hearing may be of a legislative type; the notice shall conform to the requirements of 40 CFR 51.4(b); and the agency rules or procedures may provide that if no notice of intent to participate in the hearing is received from any member of the public (other than the applicant) prior to 7 days before the scheduled hearing date, no hearing need be held. If notice of intent to participate is required, the fact shall be noted prominently in the required hearing notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)-(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> On or before January 30, 1975, the Massachusetts Port Authority (``Massport'') shall prepare and submit to the Governor for his approval a plan showing the manner in which the number of commercial parking spaces at Logan Airport which exceeds the number of such spaces permitted under the freeze shall be removed from use. The Governor shall approve such plan if he determines that (1) implementation of such plan would result in reducing the aggregate number of commercial parking spaces to the level of such spaces permitted by this section, (2) Massport has adequate legal authority to implement such plan and (3) adequate commitments have been made by Massport to assure the Governor that such plan will be fully implemented and maintained on and after May 1, 1976. In the event that the Governor does not approve such plan by April 1, 1976, then the owner or operator of each commercial parking facility located at Logan Airport shall, on or before July 1, 1976, reduce the number of commercial parking spaces available for use at each such facility by an amount which bears the same proportion to the number of spaces exceeding the limit imposed by this section as the number of spaces available at such facility bears the total number of such spaces which were available for use at Logan Airport on April 1, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Where an agency approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of this section to issue permits for new construction in the City of Cambridge demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Governor that (1) specific on-street parking spaces in use as of October 15, 1973, were being legally and regularly

used as of such date for parking by commuters (as that term is defined in Sec. 52.1161(a)(6)) who are not residents of Cambridge and that (2) effective measures have been implemented (including adequate enforcement) to prevent such spaces from being used by such commuters, then such approved agency may issue permits for construction of additional new commercial parking spaces equal to one-half of the number of spaces removed from regular use by such commuters and the total quantity of commercial parking spaces allowable in Cambridge under this section shall be raised accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> On or before July 31, 1976, and on or before each succeeding July 31, the Governor and the chief executive officer of any agency approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of this section shall submit a report to the Regional Administrator setting forth:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The names and addresses of all persons who received permits during the previous twelve-month period ending June 30 and number of spaces allocated to each such person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of commercial parking spaces available for use as of the June 30 prior to the date of the report;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The number of commercial parking spaces which remain available for allocation by the Governor or such agency as of the June 30 prior to the date of the report, including those spaces made available because of retirement of existing commercial parking spaces as well as those spaces made available because of the effects of paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The location and capacity of any park-and-ride facility designated under paragraph (p) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> The Governor and any approved agency may issue a permit to construct a commercial parking facility which is designated by the Governor as a park-and-ride facility to be operated in conjunction with mass transit service without regard to the limitations on number of spaces imposed by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Where an agency approved by the Governor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Governor that there have been physically eliminated through permanent modification or demolition any legal on-street parking spaces within a municipality then such agency may issue permits for construction within that municipality of additional new commercial parking spaces equal to the number of spaces thus eliminated and the total quantity of commercial parking spaces allowable for such municipality under this section shall be increased accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> The provisions of this regulation shall cease to be effective as to that portion of the freeze area lying within the City of Boston and not included within Boston proper or Logan Airport at such time as the City of Boston implements a program, approved by the Governor, which shall include effective measures to control the construction of additional commercial parking spaces within that area, including procedures for issuance of conditional use permits under applicable zoning regulations and for assuring compliance with all air quality requirements under state and Federal law.
