In many cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such a guide is available. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor shall follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program-specific audit guide not available. (1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The auditee shall prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.315(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.315(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The auditor shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain an understanding of internal control and perform tests of internal control over the Federal program consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.500(c) for a major program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.500(d) for a major program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 99.500(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with the stated accounting policies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A report on compliance which includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with Sec. 99.505(d)(1), and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.505(d)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Report submission for program-specific audits. (1) The audit shall be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the Federal agency that provided the funding or a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, the audit shall be completed and the required reporting shall be submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or 13 months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.) Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make report copies available for public inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The audit shall be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the Federal agency that provided the funding or a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.

The data collection form prepared in accordance with Sec. 99.320(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and one copy of this reporting package shall be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by the OMB to be retained as an archival copy. Also, when the schedule of findings and

questioned costs disclosed audit findings or the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any audit findings, the auditee shall submit one copy of the reporting package to the Federal clearinghouse on behalf of the Federal awarding agency, or directly to the pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient. Instead of submitting the reporting package to the pass-through entity, when a subrecipient is not required to submit a reporting package to the pass-through entity, the subrecipient shall provide written notification to the pass-through entity, consistent with the requirements of Sec. 99.320(e)(2). A subrecipient may submit a copy of the reporting package to the pass-through entity to comply with this notification requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other sections of this part may apply.
