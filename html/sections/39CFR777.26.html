                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Moving Expenses. Displaced persons who are occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving expenses under Sec. 777.23 subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the person owns the mobile home, moving expenses may, at the owner's option, include any reasonable costs incurred to move the mobile home to a replacement site, plus the reasonable cost of disassembling, moving, and reassembling any attached appurtenances (such as porches, decks, skirting, and awnings) which were not acquired, anchoring of the unit, and utility ``hook-up charges.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the person rents the mobile home, the Postal Service may allow the person moving expense benefits for moving the mobile home as if the person were an owner of the mobile home under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If costs of moving a mobile home are paid as moving expenses under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the person may not receive housing assistance benefits hereunder, other than any benefits to which they are entitled that are limited to the site of the mobile home.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Displaced occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving expenses for personal property other than the mobile home and its appurtenances, but only to the extent the Postal Service does not pay the costs of moving the mobile home (either as moving expenses or replacement housing payments or, if it does pay such costs, the

personal property is of a type that is customarily moved separately from the mobile home.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Replacement Housing Payments. Displaced persons who are 180 day or 90 day occupants of mobile homes qualify for replacement housing payments under Sec. 777.24 subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the displaced person owns the mobile home and owns the site, the person is eligible for benefits under either Sec. 777.24 (b) or (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the displaced person rents the mobile home and rents the site the person is eligible for benefits under Sec. 777.24(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the displaced person rents the mobile home and owns the site the person is eligible for benefits under Sec. 777.24(e), with regard to the mobile home and to benefits under Sec. 777.24(b) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on the home and site benefits combined of $22,500. (Persons who voluntarily sell mobile home sites are not displaced persons and are not entitled to benefits under Subpart B. See Sec. 777.13(e)(2)(viii)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the displaced person owns the mobile home and rents the site the person is eligible for benefits under either Sec. 777.24 (b) or (e) with regard to the mobile home and to benefits as a tenant under Sec. 777.24(e) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on home and site benefits combined of $5,250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special Rules for Mobile Homes. (1) In computing replacement housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this section, apply the terms of Sec. 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In computing replacement housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this section, apply the terms of Sec. 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remainder that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. When the Postal Service determines that its acquisition of the real property has had this effect and that for this reason a mobile home occupant located on the remaining part of the property is required to move, such occupant shall be considered a displaced person under these regulations and shall be entitled to such benefits hereunder as the person would otherwise qualify.
