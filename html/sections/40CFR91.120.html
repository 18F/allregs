The  deterioration factors must be applied as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For marine spark-ignition engines not utilizing aftertreatment  technology (for example, catalytic converters), the official exhaust  emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test  point are adjusted by adding the appropriate deterioration factor to the  results.
