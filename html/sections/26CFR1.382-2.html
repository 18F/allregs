                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certain definitions for purposes of sections 382 and 383 and the regulations thereunder. The following definitions apply for purposes of sections 382 and 383 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Loss corporation--(i) In general. The term loss corporation means a corporation which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term loss corporation means a corporation which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is entitled to use a net operating loss carryforward, a capital loss carryover, a carryover of excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), a carryforward of a general business credit under section 39, or a carryover of a minimum tax credit under section 53,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the taxable year that includes a testing date, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section or Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i), whichever is applicable (determined for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1) without regard to whether the corporation is a loss corporation), has a net operating loss, a net capital loss, excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), unused general business credits under section 38, or an unused minimum tax credit under section 53, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1) by treating the date on which such determination is made as the change date). See section 382(h)(3) for the definition of net unrealized built-in loss.
See section 383 and Sec. 1.383-1 for rules relating to a loss corporation that has an ownership change and has capital losses, excess foreign taxes, general business credits or minimum tax credits. Any predecessor or successor to a loss corporation described in this paragraph (a)(1) is also a loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributor or transferor loss corporation in a transaction under section 381. Notwithstanding that a loss corporation ceases to exist under state law, if its net operating loss carryforwards, excess foreign taxes, or other items described in section 381(c) are succeeded to and taken into account by an acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a), such loss corporation shall be treated as continuing in existence until--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any pre-change losses (excluding pre-change credits described in Sec. 1.383-1(c)(3)), determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, are fully utilized or expire under either section 172 or section 1212,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any net unrealized built-in losses, determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, may no longer be treated as pre-change losses, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any pre-change credits (described in Sec. 1.383-1(c)(3)), determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, are fully utilized or expire under sections 39, 53, or 904(c).
Following a transaction described in the preceding sentence, the stock of the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the stock of the loss corporation for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs with respect to the pre-change losses and net unrealized built-in losses that may be treated as pre-change losses of the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Separate accounting required for losses and credits of an acquiring corporation and a distributor or transferor loss corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, pre-change losses (determined as if the testing date were the change date and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss), that are succeeded to and taken into account by an acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies must be accounted for separately from losses and credits of the acquiring corporation for purposes of applying this section. See Example (2) of Sec. 1.382-2T(e)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> End of separate accounting for losses and credits of distributor or transferor loss corporation. The separate tracking of owner shifts of the stock of an acquiring corporation required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the net operating loss carryovers and other attributes described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section ends when a fold-in event occurs. A fold-in event is either an ownership change of the distributor or transferor corporation in connection with, or after, the transaction to which section 381(a) applies, or a period of 5

consecutive years following the section 381(a) transaction during which the distributor or transferor corporation has not had an ownership change. Starting on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the day of the section 381(a) transaction) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period, the losses and other attributes of the distributor or transferor corporation are treated as losses and attributes of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs with respect to such losses. Also, for purposes of determining the beginning of the acquiring corporation's testing period, such losses are considered to arise either in a taxable year that begins not earlier than the later of the day following the change date or the day of the section 381(a) transaction, or in a taxable year that begins 3 years before the end of the 5 consecutive year period. Pre-change losses of a distributor or transferor corporation that are subject to a limitation under section 382 continue to be subject to the limitation notwithstanding the occurrence of a fold-in event. Any ownership change that occurs in connection with, or subsequent to, the section 381 transaction may result in an additional, lesser limitation with respect to such pre-change losses. This paragraph (a)(1)(iv) applies to any testing date occurring on or after January 29, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application to other successor corporations. This paragraph (a)(1) also applies, as the context may require, to successor corporations other than successors in section 381(a) transactions. For example, if a corporation receives assets from the loss corporation that have basis in excess of value, the recipient corporation's basis for the assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the loss corporation's basis, and the amount by which basis exceeds value is material, the recipient corporation is a successor corporation subject to this paragraph (a)(1). This paragraph (a)(1)(v) applies to any testing date occurring on or after January 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-change loss. The term pre-change loss means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any net operating loss carryforward of the old loss corporation to the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change date occurs,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any net operating loss of the old loss corporation for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs to the extent such loss is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any recognized built-in loss for any recognition period taxable year (within the meaning of 382(h)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any pre-change capital losses described in Sec. 1.383-1T(c)(2)(i) and (ii), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any pre-change credits described in 1.383-1T(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock--(i) In general. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(3)(i) and Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii), the term stock means stock other than stock described in section 1504(a)(4). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, stock that is not described in section 1504(a)(4) solely because it is entitled to vote as a result of dividend arrearages shall be treated as so described and thus shall not be considered stock. Stock described in section 1504(a)(4), however, is not excluded for purposes of determining the value of the loss corporation under section 382(e). The determination of the percentage of stock of any corporation owned by any person shall be made on the basis of the relative fair market value of the stock owned by such person to the total fair market value of the outstanding stock of the corporation. Solely for purposes of determining the percentage of stock owned by a person, each share of all the outstanding shares of stock that have the same material terms is treated as having the same value. Thus, for example, a control premium or blockage discount is disregarded in determining the percentage of stock owned by any person. The previous two sentences of this paragraph (a)(3)(i) apply to any testing date occurring on or after January 29, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The previous two sentences of this paragraph (a)(3)(i) apply to any testing date occurring on or after January 29, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Convertible stock. The term stock includes any convertible stock. For rules regarding the treatment of certain convertible stock as an option, see Sec. 1.382-4(d)(9)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Testing date--(i) In general.

this section, a loss corporation is required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after any owner shift, or issuance or transfer (including an issuance or transfer described in Sec. 1.382-4(d)(8)(i) or (ii)) of an option with respect to stock of the loss corporation that is treated as exercised under Sec. 1.382-4(d)(2). Each date on which a loss corporation is required to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date. All computations of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date and any transactions described in this paragraph (a)(4) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing date. See Sec. 1.382-2T(e)(1) for the definition of owner shift. The term option, as used in this paragraph (a)(4), includes interests that are treated as options under Sec. 1.382-4(d)(9).

A successor corporation is a distributee or transferee corporation that succeeds to and takes into account items described in section 381(c) from a corporation as the result of an acquisition of assets described in section 381(a). A successor corporation also includes, as the context may require, a corporation which receives an asset or assets from another corporation if the corporation's basis for the asset(s) is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the other corporation's basis and the amount by which basis differs from value is, in the aggregate, material. The previous sentence of this paragraph (a)(5) applies to any testing date occurring on or after January 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Predecessor corporation.

Sec. 1.382-2T  Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Ownership change--(1) In general. A corporation is a new loss corporation and thus subject to limitation under section 382 only if an ownership change has occurred with respect to such corporation. An ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if it is a loss corporation on a testing date and, immediately after the close of the testing date, the percentage of stock of the corporation owned by one or more 5-percent shareholders has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock of such corporation owned by such shareholders at any time during the testing period. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the definition of testing date. See paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of testing period. See Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1) and paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the respective definition of loss corporation and new loss corporation. See paragraph (g) of this section for the definition of 5-percent shareholder. See section 383 and Sec. 1.383-1 for rules relating to loss corporations that have an ownership change and have capital loss carryovers, excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c), carryovers of general business credits under section 39, or unused minimum tax credits under section 53.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A corporation is a new loss corporation and thus subject to limitation under section 382 only if an ownership change has occurred with respect to such corporation.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any transfer of stock of the loss corporation (or an option with respect to such stock) in any of the circumstances described in section 382(l)(3)(B), or any equity structure shift that is not also an owner shift, is not an event that requires the loss corporation to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred. For purposes of this section, each date on which a loss corporation is required to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date, all computations of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date, and any transactions described in this paragraph (a)(2)(i) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing date. See paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for the respective definitions of owner shift and equity structure shift.

In order to determine whether an ownership change has occurred on a testing date, the loss corporation must identify each 5-percent shareholder whose percentage of stock ownership in the loss corporation immediately after the close of the testing date has increased, compared to such shareholder's lowest percentage of stock ownership in such corporation at any time during the testing period. The amount of the increase in the percentage of stock ownership in the loss corporation of each 5-percent shareholder must be computed separately by comparing the percentage ownership of each such 5-percent shareholder immediately after the close of the testing date to such shareholder's lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period. Each such increase in the percentage ownership of a 5-percent shareholder is then added together with any other such increases of other 5-percent shareholders to determine whether an ownership change has occurred. Because only those 5-percent shareholders whose percentages of stock ownership have increased are taken into account, a 5-percent shareholder is disregarded if his percentage of stock ownership, immediately after the close of the testing date, has decreased (or has remained the same), compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest on any previous date during the testing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The determination whether an ownership change has occurred is made without regard to

whether the changes in stock ownership of the loss corporation (by one or more 5-percent shareholders) result from related or unrelated events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L has outstanding 200 shares of common stock. A, B and C respectively own 100, 50 and 50 shares of the L stock. On January 2, 1988, A sells 60 shares of L stock to B. Thus, B's percentage ownership interest in L increases by 30 percentage points, from 50 shares to 110 shares. On January 1, 1989, A purchases C's entire interest in L. Thus, A's percentage ownership interest in L increases by 25 percentage points, compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest in L, from 40 shares immediately following the January 2, 1988 sale to B to 90 shares. Even though A's ownership interest in L as of January 1, 1989 has decreased, compared to his 50 percent ownership interest at the beginning of the testing period, A is a 5-percent shareholder who must be taken into account for purposes of the computation required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section because his interest in L on that testing date (45 percent) has increased, compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest in L at any time during the testing period (20 percent following the sale to B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accordingly, although A and B jointly have increased their aggregate total ownership interest in L between January 2, 1988 and January 1, 1989 by only 25 percentage points (i.e., the total ownership interest in L held by A and B at all times is not less than a 75 percent interest), the total of their separate increases in the percentage stock ownership of L, compared to their respective lowest percentage ownership interests at any time during the testing period, is 55 percentage points. Thus, an ownership change occurs as a result of A's acquisition of L stock on January 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Testing period--(1) In general.

In determining if an ownership change occurs on the July 1, 1991 testing date, B's acquisition of L stock is disregarded because it occurred before the testing period that ends on such testing date.

Transfers of loss corporation stock between persons who are not 5-percent shareholders of such corporation (and between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3)(iii) of this section) are not owner shifts and thus are not taken into account. See paragraph (h)(4)(xi) of this section for a similar rule applicable to transfers of options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A has owned all 1000 shares of outstanding L stock for more than three years. On June 15, 1988, A sells 300 of his L shares to B. This transaction is an owner shift. No other 5-percent shareholder has increased his percentage ownership of L stock during the testing period. Thus, the owner shift resulting from B's acquisition does not result in an ownership change, because B has increased his stock ownership in L by only 30 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1). In addition, on June 15, 1989, L issues 100 shares to each of C, D and AA. The stock issuance is an owner shift. The transaction, however, does not result in an ownership change, because B, C, D and AA (the 5-percent shareholders whose stock ownership has increased as of the testing date, compared to any other time during the testing period) have increased their percentage of stock ownership in L by a total of only 46.2 percentage points during the testing period (by 23.1 percentage points [300 shares/1300 shares] for B, and 7.7 percentage points [100 shares/1300 shares] for each of C, D and AA).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. All 1000 shares of L stock are owned by a group of 100 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (``Public L''). Several of the members of Public L sell their L stock, amounting to a 30 percent ownership interest in L, to B on June 15, 1988. The sale of stock to B is an owner shift. Between June 16, 1988 and June 15, 1989, each of the remaining individuals in Public L sells his stock to another person who is not a 5-percent shareholder. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, trading activity among the members of Public L is disregarded and does not result in an owner shift. On June 15, 1989, L issues 100 shares to each of C, D and AA. The only sale transactions by members of Public L that are taken into account in determining whether an ownership change occurs on June 15, 1989 are the sales to B on June 15, 1988. Because B, C, D and AA together have increased their percentage ownership of L stock as a result of B's purchase and the stock issuance by an amount not in excess of 50 percentage points during the testing period ending on June 15, 1988, an ownership change does not occur on that date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (2). In addition, on December 15, 1989, L redeems 200 of the L shares from A. The redemption is an owner shift that results in an ownership change, because B, C, D and AA are 5-percent shareholders whose percentage ownership of L increase by a total of 54.6 percentage points during the testing period (by 27.3 percentage points [300 shares/1100 shares] for B and 9.1 percentage points [100 shares/1100 shares] for each of C, D and AA).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. L is owned entirely by 10,000 unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the stock of L (``Public L''). Accordingly, Public L is L's only 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (j)(1) of this section. There are one million shares of common stock outstanding. On December 1, 1988, L issues two million new shares of its common stock to members of the public, none of whom owned any L stock prior to the issuance. Following the public offering, no shareholder of L owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of L stock. Under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, however, all of the newly issued stock is treated as acquired by a 5-percent shareholder (``Public NL'') that is unrelated to Public L. Therefore, the public offering constitutes an owner shift that results in an ownership change because Public NL's percentage of stock ownership in L increased by 66\2/3\ percentage points (two million shares acquired in the public offering/three million shares outstanding following the offering) over its lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (0 percent prior to the offering).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example (5), except that L issues only 500,000 new shares of L stock on December 1, 1988, and Public NL's percentage ownership interest in L increases by only 33\1/3\ percentage points (500,000 shares acquired in the public offering/1.5 million shares outstanding following the offering). During the two years following December 2, 1988, 14 percent of the stock outstanding on that date is sold over a public stock exchange. On December 3, 1990, A purchases five percent of L stock (75,000 shares) over a public stock exchange. The purchase of five percent of L stock by A is an owner shift and is presumed to have been made proportionately from Public L and Public NL under paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, transfers of L stock in transactions not involving A (i.e., in transactions among or between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section) are not taken into account, and do not constitute owner shifts. (Transfers between members of Public NL and Public L, which are treated as separate 5-percent shareholders solely by virtue of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, are disregarded even if L has actual knowledge of any such transfers.) A and Public NL, the only 5-percent shareholders whose interests in L have increased during the testing period, have increased their respective stock ownership by only 36\2/3\ percentage points--five percentage points for A [75,000 shares/1.5 million shares outstanding] and 31\2/3\ percentage points for Public NL [((500,000 shares issued in the public offering)-(5 percent x 500,000 shares presumed to have been acquired by A)) /1.5 million shares outstanding]. Accordingly, there is no ownership change with respect to L notwithstanding that, taking into account the public trading, a change of more than 50 percentage points in the ultimate beneficial ownership of L stock occurred during the three-year period ending on the December 3, 1990 testing date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that five percent of the L stock has always been owned by P which, in turn, has always been owned by Public P. On December 6, 1990, P sells all of its L stock over a public stock exchange. Although the trading of P stock among persons that are not 5-percent share-holders (without regard to the segregation rules of paragraph (j) of this section) are disregarded under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the disposition of the L stock by P is not disregarded because the L stock is transferred in a transaction that is subject to paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Equity structure shift--(i) Tax-free reorganizations.

See paragraph (e)(i)(E) of this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owns all of the stock of L and B owns all of the stock of P. On October 13, 1988, L merges into P in a reorganization described in section 368a(1)(A). As a result of the merger, A and B own 25 and 75 percent, respectively, of the stock of P. The merger is an equity structure shift (and, because it affects the percentage of L stock owned by 5-percent shareholders, it also constitutes an owner shift). On the October 13, 1988 testing date, B is a 5-percent shareholder whose stock ownership in the loss corporation following the merger has increased by 75 percentage points over his lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger). Accordingly, an ownership change occurs as a result of the merger. P is thus a new loss corporation and L's pre-change losses are subject to limitation under section 382.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A owns 100 percent of L1 stock and B owns 100 percent of L2 stock. On January 1, 1988, L1 merges into L2 in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A). Immediately after the merger, A and B own 40 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the L2 stock. There is an equity structure shift (as well as an owner shift) with respect to both L1 and L2 on January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the percentage of L2 stock owned by B immediately after the merger (60 percent) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of L1 owned by B during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger), there is an ownership change with respect to L1. L2 is a new loss corporation and thus, under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(iii) of this section, the pre-change losses of L1 must be accounted for separately by L2 from the losses of L2 (immediately before the ownership change) and are subject to limitation under section 382. See Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(iv) of this section for rules that end separate accounting for L1's pre-change

losses on any testing date occurring on or after January 29, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> L2 is a new loss corporation because it is a successor corporation to L1. There is no ownership change with respect to L2, however, because A's stock ownership in L2 increased by only 40 percentage points (to 40 percent) over the amount owned by A prior to the merger (0 percent). Therefore, the pre-change losses of L2 are not limited under section 382 as a result of the merger.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The result in Example (2) would be the same if L1 had survived the merger (i.e., L2 merged into L1) with A and B owning 40 and 60 percent, respectively, of L1 stock. L1's pre-change losses would be accounted for separately and limited under section 382 and the pre-change losses of L2 would be accounted for separately under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(iii) of this section, but would not be limited under section 382. See Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) for the treatment of L2 following the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as Example (2), except, instead of acquiring L1 in a merger, L2 acquires all of the L1 stock from A on January 1, 1988, solely in exchange for stock representing a 40 percent interest in L2, in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B). The acquisition of stock by L2 is an equity structure shift (as well as an owner shift) with respect to L1 that results in an ownership change with respect to L1 because the percentage of L1 stock owned by B immediately after the reorganization (60 percent, by virtue of B's ownership of L2, through the operation of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of L1 stock owned by B at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the reorganization). The acquisition also results in an equity structure shift and an owner shift with respect to L2, but L2 incurs no ownership change, because A's stock ownership in L2 increased by only 40 percentage points over the percentage of L2 stock owned by A prior to the reorganization (0 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definitions.

P2 and P3, and P3, each of which has a direct ownership interest in a first tier entity (E) of five percent or more, are higher tier entities with respect to L and, because neither entity is owned at any time during the testing period by a higher tier entity, they

also are highest tier entities.

A purchases 5,000 shares of L stock over a public stock exchange on June 8, 1989. The purchase is an owner shift. When added to his ownership interest before that date (the testing date), A owns 7,500 shares of L stock (7.5 percent). Under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(A) of this section, L may treat A and Public L as having owned 0 percent and 100 percent, respectively, at all times prior to

June 8, 1989 (rather than having owned 2.5 percent by A and 97.5 percent by Public L, even if L has actual knowledge of A's less than five percent ownership interest). The increase in A's stock ownership of L as of June 8, 1989 thus would be 7.5 percentage points, rather than 5.0 percentage points, for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on that testing date and any subsequent testing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Constructive ownership of stock--(1) In general.

After the acquisition, P is a first tier entity and a higher tier entity of L. B and C are each 5-percent owners of P and also are 5-percent shareholders of L having a 42 percent and 18 percent stock ownership interest in L, respectively, through the operation of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section. Because B and C together have increased their ownership in L by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period ending on the testing date (60 percent on the testing date and 0 percent prior thereto), an ownership change occurs with respect to L on July 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The respective values of each share of HC stock, common and preferred, are equal. The stock of L is attributed to A through his interest in HC common stock, but not through his interest in HC preferred stock (see paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section). Thus, A is treated as owning indirectly only 40 percent of L. B and C are 5-percent shareholders of L having indirect ownership interests in L of 42 percent and 18 percent, respectively, through their ownership of HC common stock.

On July 30, 1990, A sells 41 shares of his L stock to BB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the date on which each option is acquired is a testing date. The issuance of options to acquire L stock to each of B, C, and D is not treated as an acquisition of the underlying stock on any such testing date since such treatment with respect to any one of the option owners (or any combination thereof) would not have resulted in an ownership change on any of those testing dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date on which BB acquires 41 shares also is a testing date. BB's acquisition of 41 percent of the L stock, taken together with the shift in ownership that would result if the options held by B, C and D were exercised, would result in an ownership change, because the stock owned or treated as owned by Public L (a group including only B, the sole shareholder who owns less than five percent of L stock), C, D and BB would have increased by 66 percentage points (four, six, 15, and 41 percentage points, respectively) during the testing period. Subject to paragraph (h)(4)(ix) of this section, the options are treated as exercised and an ownership change occurs on July 30, 1990, pursuant to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. Accordingly, no new testing period can begin before July 31, 1990. Under paragraph (h)(4)(x)(F) of this section, the option attribution rules of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall not be applicable with respect to any of the options owned by B, C, and D immediately before the ownership change until such time, if any, that such options are transferred to (or by) 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if such option were exercised). In addition, the subsequent exercise of any of those options by A, B, or C (the persons owning such options immediately before the ownership change) is disregarded. See paragraph (h)(4)(vi) of this section. Also see paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section for the treatment of options that lapse or are forfeited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The facts are the same as in (i), except that the sale of A's 41 shares of L stock to BB occurs on July 30, 1995.

On July 22, 1988, the value of A's stock in L is $500 and the following agreements are entered into: (i) A sells 40 shares of his L stock to B for $200, (ii) in exchange for $10, A grants B an option to acquire the balance of his L stock for $305 at

any time before July 22, 1992, and (iii) L grants A an option to acquire 100 shares of L stock at a price of $600 exercisable until such time as B's option is no longer outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the stock subject to the options owned by both A and B were treated as acquired on the July 22, 1988 testing date, B would have increased his ownership interest in L by only 50 percentage points to 50 percent ([40 shares purchased + 60 shares acquired pursuant to the option]/200 outstanding shares of L stock, including 100 shares deemed outstanding pursuant to the option issued to A by L) as compared with 0 percent prior to July 22, 1988. In determining whether the options with respect to the stock of L would, if exercised, result in an ownership change, paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section requires that such options be treated as exercised separately with respect to each 5-percent shareholder, each person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised or each combination of such persons. Therefore, by treating the option owned by A as not having been exercised and the option owned by B as having been exercised, B's interest in L increases by 100 percentage points during the testing period. An ownership change with respect to L therefore results from the transactions occurring on July 22, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contingencies.

The public owners, 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders and public shareholders in any public group, subject to paragraphs (j)(2)(iii), (k)(2) and (k)(4) of this section, are presumed not to be members of any other public group. It also is presumed that each such person is unrelated to all other shareholders (direct and indirect) of the loss corporation. See paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of this section. The members of a public group that exists by virtue of its direct ownership interest in an entity are presumed not to be members (and not to be related to a member) of any other public group that exists at any time by virtue of its direct ownership interest in any other entity. To the extent that the presumptions adopted in this paragraph (j)(1)(iii) are not applicable because the loss corporation has actual knowledge of facts to the contrary and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, public shareholders, public owners and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent

shareholders may be aggregated into additional public groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Identification of the public groups treated as 5-percent shareholders--(A) Analysis of highest tier entities. The loss corporation must identify first tier entities and higher tier entities in order to identify any highest tier entities that must be identified under paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The loss corporation must then identify any 5-percent owners of each such highest tier entity who indirectly own, at any time during the testing period, five percent or more of the loss corporation through the ownership interest in such highest tier entity. Under paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, any such 5-percent owner is a 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (k)(3) of this section for rules explaining the extent of the obligation of the loss corporation to determine the identity of its shareholders. Each person who has an ownership interest in any highest tier entity and who is not treated as a 5-percent shareholder (i.e., persons who are public owners or 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders) is a member of the public group of that highest tier entity. A public group, so identified, that indirectly owns five percent or more of the loss corporation on the testing date is treated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as a 5-percent shareholder. If the public group so identified owns less than five percent of the loss corporation on the testing date, such public group is treated as part of the public group of the next lower tier entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Analysis of highest tier entities. The loss corporation must identify first tier entities and higher tier entities in order to identify any highest tier entities that must be identified under paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The loss corporation must then identify any 5-percent owners of each such highest tier entity who indirectly own, at any time during the testing period, five percent or more of the loss corporation through the ownership interest in such highest tier entity. Under paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, any such 5-percent owner is a 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (k)(3) of this section for rules explaining the extent of the obligation of the loss corporation to determine the identity of its shareholders. Each person who has an ownership interest in any highest tier entity and who is not treated as a 5-percent shareholder (i.e., persons who are public owners or 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders) is a member of the public group of that highest tier entity. A public group, so identified, that indirectly owns five percent or more of the loss corporation on the testing date is treated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as a 5-percent shareholder.

The public shareholders are aggregated and, under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, are treated as a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder without regard to whether such group, at any time during the testing period, owns five percent or more of the loss corporation. For this purpose, if the public group of any first tier entity indirectly owns less than five percent of the loss corporation on the testing date, and is thus not treated as a 5-percent shareholder, but is treated as part of the public group of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the ownership interest of that group is included in the public group of the loss corporation referred to in the preceding sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Appropriate adjustments.

All of the stock of P is owned by 150,000 shareholders, none of whom own as much as five percent of P stock (``Public P''). Between July 12, 1988 and August 13, 1988, P purchases all of the L stock through a series of transactions on the public stock exchange. P's percentage of direct stock ownership in L increases from 4.9 percent to five percent on July 15, 1988, and from 50 percent to 51 percent on July 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Before July 15, 1988, P is a public shareholder of L. On and after July 15, 1988, P is a first tier entity (and a highest tier entity) of L. Accordingly, under the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, Public P, on and after July 15, 1988, is treated as a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder. Each acquisition by P on and after such date affects the percentage of L stock that is owned by Public P and thus constitutes an owner shift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Immediately after the transaction on July 30, 1988, P owns 51 percent of L stock. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, Public P thus owns 51 percent of L. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, Public L, the public group that includes the public

shareholders of L, is treated as a 5-percent shareholder that owns 49 percent of L. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, Public L and Public P are presumed not to have any common members and it is also presumed that no member of either public group is related to any other member of either of the two public groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assuming that the presumption provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section (i.e., that no person owns stock in both P and L) is not rebutted to any extent, Public P is treated as a 5-percent shareholder whose stock ownership in L, as of the July 30, 1988 testing date, has increased by 51 percentage points over its lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to July 12, 1988). Accordingly, an ownership change with respect to L occurs as a result of P's acquisition on July 30, 1988. L is thus a new loss corporation and its pre-change losses are subject to limitation under section 382.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of the stock of P is owned by 1,000 unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P stock. L1 is a wholly owned subsidiary of P. On January 2, 1988, P distributes all of the L1 stock pro rata to its shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to the stock distribution, the public owners of P are members of a public group (``Public P'') that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 100 percent of the stock of L1.</p><p class="depth0">See paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. Following the stock distribution to the P shareholders, L1 is owned by 1,000 public shareholders that are members of a public group (``Public L1'') that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 100 percent of the stock of L1. See paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Public P and Public L1 are treated as unrelated, individual 5-percent shareholders under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section. Although the members of one public group are presumed not to be members of any other public group under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, L1 has actual knowledge that all of its public shareholders immediately following the distribution (Public L1) received L1 stock pro rata in respect to the outstanding P stock and thus were also members of Public P. Applying paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the loss corporation may take into account the identity of ownership interests between Public L1 and Public P to establish that Public L1 did not increase its percentage ownership in L1. Accordingly, the transaction would not constitute an owner shift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 of paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Thus, 20 percent of L stock is owned by A, 10 percent is owned by P1, 20 percent is owned by E, a joint venture, and the remaining 50 percent of L stock is owned by Public L. P1 is owned 15 percent by B and 85 percent by Public P1. E is owned 30 percent by P2 and 70 percent by P3, which are owned by Public P2 and Public P3, respectively. See Example (1)(ii) of paragraph (g)(4) of this section for a chart illustrating this ownership structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The public owners of P2 and P3 (Public P2 and Public P3, respectively), are public groups that are treated as 5-percent shareholders of L, because each such public group indirectly owns five percent or more of L stock (six percent by Public P2 [(30 percent ownership of E)x(20 percent ownership of L)] and 14 percent by Public P3 [(70 percent ownership of E)x(20 percent ownership of L)]). The public owners of P1 (``Public P1''), who indirectly own 8.5 percent of L stock [(85 percent ownership of P1)x(10 percent ownership of L)] and B, who indirectly owns 1.5 percent of L and is thus included in Public P1 under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, are members of a public group that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder of L that owns ten percent of L stock. Finally, the public group of L (``Public L'') is a 5-percent shareholder that owns 50 percent of L. Accordingly, A, Public L, Public P1 (including B), Public P2, and Public P3 are the only 5-percent shareholders of L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 3 above, except that P3 is owned 60 percent by C, 30 percent by P4, and 10 percent by P3. The stock of P4 is publicly traded and is owned by Public P4. The facts are thus the same as in Example (2) in paragraph (g)(4) of this section. See Example (2)(ii) of paragraph (g)(4) of this section for a chart illustrating this ownership structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The public owners of P4 (a highest tier entity) are members of a public group that indirectly owns 4.2 percent of L ([30 percent ownership of P3]x[70 percent ownership of E]x[20 percent ownership of L]). For purposes of identifying public groups that are 5-.percent shareholders, L is not required to identify P4 as a highest tier entity under paragraph (k)(3) of this section because P4 does not own five percent or more of L stock. Moreover, under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, P4 generally is treated as an individual from which there is no attribution of loss corporation stock. The public group of P3 (including P4) indirectly owns 5.6 percent of L ([40 percent of P3]x[70 percent ownership of E]x[20 percent of L]), and is thus a 5-percent shareholder of L. The public groups of P2 and P1 (both Public P1 and B), respectively, also own five percent or more of L stock and are thus 5-percent shareholders of L. In addition, the public group of L is a 5-percent shareholder regardless of whether it owns five percent of L stock. Accordingly, A, Public L, Public P3 (including P4), Public P2, and Public P1 (including B), are the only 5-percent shareholders of L.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5(i) On September 4, 1987, L is owned 14 percent by each of A and B, 30 percent by each of P1 and P2, four percent by each of C and P3, and two percent by each of D and AA. P1 is owned 30 percent by each of A, B, and P4 and 10 percent by D. P2 is owned 70 percent by A, 10 percent by each of B and D, six percent by DD and four percent by C. AA owns 100 percent of the stock of P3. P4 is owned 60 percent by C and 20 percent by each of BB and CC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ownership structure of L is illustrated by the following chart:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17OC91.004</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In order to identify L's 5-percent shareholders and their respective ownership interests in L on September 4, 1987, the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section apply to identify the public groups that are treated as separate 5-percent shareholders. Analysis begins with any highest tier entity, such as P4. Each of P4's shareholders is a 5-percent owner of P4. C4 owns 5.4 percent of L in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P4 and therefore is a 5-percent shareholder. Notwithstanding that C actually owns, directly and by attribution, 10.6 percent of L (four percent directly, 5.4 percent indirectly through P4, and 1.2 percent through P2), C's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is presumed to include only the 5.4 percent indirect ownership through P4. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for C's direct and indirect ownership interests in determining whether an ownership change occurs

on any testing date if it has actual knowledge of such ownership on or berfore the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date). Although BB and CC are each 5-percent owners of P4, they are not 5-percent shareholders and therefore are members of the public group of P4. Because the public group of P4 indirectly owns only 3.6 percent of L, it is treated under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section as part of the public group of the next lower tier entity, P1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to P1, a first tier entity, each of its shareholders are 5-percent owners. Because A and B each indirectly own nine percent of L as 5-percent owners of P1 and A indirectly owns 21 percent of L as a 5-percent owner of P2, they are each 5-percent shareholders without regard to their direct ownership interests in L. A's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is 44 percent (14 percent directly, nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P1, and 21 percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P2). B's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is 23 percent (14 percent directly and nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent and nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P1). B's ownership interest as a 5-percent shareholder does not include the three percent interest he owns indirectly through P2. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for B's direct and indirect ownership interests, including his three percent interest through P2, in determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date if L has actual knowledge of such ownership on or before the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date.) D is a 5-percent owner of P1. Although D owns eight percent of L (two percent directly, three percent indirectly through P1, and three percent indirectly through P2), he is not a 5-percent shareholder because he does not own five percent or more of L stock either directly or in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of either P1 or P2. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for D's direct and indirect ownership interests in determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date to the extent L has actual knowledge of such ownership amounting to five percent or more of L stock before the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date.) The public group of P1 (comprised of the public group of P4 and D's direct ownership interest in P1) has a 6.6 percent interest in L and is therefore treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> With respect to highest tier entity P2, D is a 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder for the reason described in the preceding subdivision. DD is a 5-percent owner of P2, who is not a 5-percent shareholder, because DD indirectly owns only 1.8 percent of L. Assuming that L does not have actual knowledge of B's and C's direct ownership interest in P2, those interests are accounted for in computing the ownership interest are accounted for in computing the ownership interest of the public group of P2. Therefore, each of P2's shareholders, except A who is a 5-percent shareholder in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P2, are treated as members of the public group of P2 that owns nine percent of L and is thus treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Because the direct ownership interest of P3 is less than five percent, it is a public shareholder. Therefore, assuming that L does not have actual knowledge of C's, D's, or AA's direct and/or indirect ownership interests in L, the public group of L is a separate 5-percent shareholder owning 12 percent of L (comprised of the direct ownership interests of C, D, AA and P3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Segregation rules applicable to transactions involving the loss corporation--(i) In general.

See Sec. 1.382-3(j) for exceptions to the segregation rules of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P1 owns 60 percent of the stock of L. The remaining L stock (40 percent) is owned by Public L. A owns 40 percent of the P1 stock. The remaining P1 stock (60 percent) is owned by Public P1. P2 is a publicly traded corporation owned by shareholders who each own less than five percent of P2 stock (Public P2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On May 22, 1988, L merges into P2 in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A), with the shareholders of L receiving an amount of P2 stock equal to 70 percent of the value of P2 immediately after the reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Immediately before the merger, L's 5-percent shareholders were Public L (40 percent), Public P1 (36 percent), and A (24 percent). Although the shareholders of P2 (immediately before the merger) do not acquire any stock in the merger, they are treated as acquiring a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation in the reorganization because P2 succeeds to the pre-change losses of L in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies. As a result of the merger, which constitutes a transaction described in (j)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, L's direct public group, Public L, must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist after the transaction (Public L and Public P2). Public L, the direct public group that exists before the merger, has a continuing 28 percent interest in the loss corporation [70 percent of P2 shares received in the merger x 40 percent shares of L owned prior to the merger] that must be segregated from the interests acquired by Public P2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In addition, Public P1, which owns five percent or more of the stock of P2 through P1's ownership interest in P2, also is segregated from any other public group (i.e., both Public L and Public P2) under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Therefore, under paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section, Public P2 (excluding the members of Public L and Public P1 immediately before the merger) is treated as a separate public group and 5-percent shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The only 5-percent shareholder whose interest in the loss corporation, P2, has increased during the testing period is Public

P2. Its interest has increased by 30 percentage points. Accordingly, no ownership change results from the merger. For purposes of measuring the shift in ownership of P2 on any subsequent testing date with a testing period that includes May 22, 1988 (the date on which L merged into P2), Public P2 will continue to be treated as a direct public group, separate from Public L (the members of which own P2 stock as a result of the merger) and Public P1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P and L are each owned by 21 equal shareholders. Each of 14 of the shareholders of P and L are owners of both corporations (``common owners''). L has actual knowledge of this cross ownership. therefore, as a group, these persons own 66\2/3\ percent of each of P and L. P stock has a value of $600 and L stock has a value of $400.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P merges into L under section 368(a)(1)(A) on June 10, 1988. Ordinarily, the direct public group of L that exists immediately before the transaction would be segregated from the direct public group that acquires stock in the merger (the public group of P immediately before the merger). In view of the common ownership of P and L, however, a third group may be created under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) of this section so that L's owners following the merger would be: The common owners (66\2/3\ percent), Public L, less the common owners, 13\1/3\ percent), and Public P, less the common owners (20 percent). Accordingly, the only 5-percent shareholder increasing its ownership interest by 20 percentage points and no ownership change occurs as a result of the merger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L is entirely owned by Public L. L commences and completes a public offering of common stock on January 22, 1988, with the result that its outstanding stock increases from 100,000 shares to 300,000 shares. No person owns as much as five percent of L stock following the public offering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The public offering of L stock is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Immediately before the public offering, L's only 5-percent shareholder was Public L, a direct public group. Therefore, Public L (as in existence immediately before the transaction) must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist immediately after the transaction. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, the acquisition of 200,000 shares of L stock in the public offering must be treated as acquired by a direct public group (``New Public L'') that is separate from Public L. Each such public group is treated as an individual that is a separate 5-percent shareholder. See paragraphs (g)(1)(iv) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As a result of the public offering, L has two 5-percent shareholders, Public L and New Public L, which own 33\1/3\ percent and 66\2/3\ percent of the stock of L, respectively. Because the members of New Public L are presumed not to be members of Public L (and not to be related to any such members), the ownership interest of New Public L immediately prior to the offering of stock was 0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> New Public L is a 5-percent shareholder that has increased its ownership interest in L by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period (by 66\2/3\ percentage points). Thus, there is an ownership change with respect to L. For purposes of subsequent transactions, Public L and New Public L will not be segregated into two public groups because a new testing period commences on the day following the change date, January 23, 1988 (i.e., any subsequent testing date will not have a testing period that includes the date of the public offering).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, but L establishes that 60,000 shares of the newly issued L stock were acquired by its shareholders of record on the date of the stock issuance (i.e., members of Public L, referred to as Acquiring Public L) by persons owning 27 percent of the L stock immediately before the stock issuance. Accordingly, L has actual knowledge that New Public L acquired no more than 140,000 shares of L stock in the public offering. Under paragraphs (j)(2)(iii) and (k)(2) of this section, New Public L may be treated as having increased its ownership interest in L by 46\2/3\ percentage points (140,000 shares acquired in the offering/300,000 shares outstanding). L also has actual knowledge that the members of Public L owning 27 percent of L stock immediately before the stock issuance (27,000 shares/100,000 shares outstanding) own 29 percent of L stock immediately after such issuance ([27,000 shares + 60,000 shares acquired in the offering]/300,000 shares outstanding). Assuming that L chooses to take its actual knowledge into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on January 22, 1988, Public L is segregated into two direct public groups immediately before the stock issuance so that the two percentage point increase in the ownership interest in L by Acquiring Public L is taken into account. The total increased ownership interest in L by New Public L and Acquiring Public L on the testing date over their lowest ownership interest during the testing period is 48\2/3\ percent. Thus, no ownership change occurs with respect to L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L is owned entirely by 10,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (``Public L''). P is owned entirely by 1,500 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of P stock (``Public P''). On December 22, 1988, L acquires all of the P stock from Public P in exchange for L stock representing 25 percent of the value of L, in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, Public L, the direct public group that owns L stock immediately before and

after the transaction to which section 1032 applies, is treated separately from Public P, the direct public group that acquires L stock in the transaction. Because Public P's percentage ownership interest in L increases to only 25 percent (as compared with 0 percent before the acquisition), no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date with a testing period that includes December 22, 1988, Public L and Public P will continue to be treated as separate 5-percent shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> See Example (4) in paragraph (j)(3)(iv) of this section for the application of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section to a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B) in which the loss corporation is acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Redemption-type transactions--(1) In general. In the case of a transaction in which the loss corporation acquires its stock in exchange for property, each direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction shall be segregated at that time (and thereafter) so that the stock that is acquired in the transaction is treated as owned by a separate public group from each public group that owns the stock that is not acquired. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term property shall include stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and stock described in paragraph (f)(18)(ii) of this section. Each direct public group that owned the stock that is acquired in the transaction is presumed not to own any such stock immediately after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. L is entirely owned by Public L. There are 500,000 shares of L stock outstanding. On July 12, 1988, L acquires 150,000 shares of its stock for cash. Because L's acquisition is a redemption, Public L is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the redeemed interests (``Public RL'') are treated as part of a public group that is separate from the ownership interests that are not redeemed (``Public CL''). Therefore, as a result of the redemption, Public CL's interest in L increases by 30 percentage points (from 70 percent (350,000/500,000) to 100 percent) on the July 12, 1988 testing date. Because the resulting increase is not more than 50 percentage points, no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes such redemption, Public CL is treated as a 5-percent shareholder whose percentage ownership interests in L increased by 30 percentage points as a result of the redemption.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. L is entirely owned by Public L. There are 250,000 shares of L common stock outstanding. On April 22, 1988, L acquires 100,000 shares of its outstanding common stock in exchange for 100,000 shares of preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4). (The transaction thus constitutes a recapitalization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(E).) As a result of the recapitalization, which is a transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, Public L is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the stock acquired by L is treated as owned by a public group (``Public RL'') that is separate from the public group that owns the stock that is not so acquired (``Public CL''). Therefore, as a result of the transaction, Public CL's interest in L increases by 40 percentage points (from 60 percent to 100 percent). Because the resulting increase is not more than 50 percentage points, no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date with a testing period that includes the date of the recapitalization, Public CL is treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder whose percentage ownership interest increased by 40 percentage points as a result of the redemption type transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Acquisition of loss corporation stock as the result of the ownership of a right to acquire stock--(1) In general. In the case of a deemed acquisition of stock of the loss corporation as the result of the ownership of a right issued by the loss corporation to acquire such stock (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section), each direct public group that exists immediately after such acquisition shall be segregated so that each direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction is treated separately from the direct public group that is deemed to acquire stock of the loss corporation as a result of the ownership of the right to acquire such stock. The direct public group that is treated as acquiring stock of the loss corporation in the transaction is presumed not to include any members of any direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction. In applying the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the segregation rules of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D) shall apply before making the determination required under that paragraph (h)(4) of this section. See

Sec. 1.382-3(j)(9) for rules relating to this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L has 700,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Public L owns all of the outstanding L common stock. On May 20, 1988, L issues a class of debentures to the public that, in the aggregate, may be converted into 300,000 shares of L common stock. On September 7, 1988, P1 acquires 210,000 shares of L common stock over a public stock exchange. None of the L debentures have been converted as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By virtue of L's issuance of convertible debentures, May 20, 1988 is a testing date. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Immediately before the issuance of the convertible debentures, L's only 5-percent shareholder was Public L, a direct public group. Therefore, under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, Public L must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist immediately after the transaction for the purpose of applying paragraph (h)(4) of this section, so that any acquisition of L stock through the conversion of L's debentures is treated as made by a public group other than Public L (``New Public L''). Assuming the largest increase in the total percentage stock ownership of New Public L on the testing date (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section), New Public L would have increased its ownership interest in L by 30 percentage points. Therefore, the stock of L would not be treated as acquired pursuant to a deemed conversion of the L debentures on May 20, 1988, under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, because the conversion would not cause an ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> P1's acquisition of L common stock results in second testing date. For the purpose of applying paragraph (h)(4) of this section, Public L must again be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise result from conversion of the debentures, so that a deemed acquisition of L stock through the conversion of L's debentures on September 7, 1988 is treated as made by a public group other than Public L (``New Public L''). As on the previous testing date, New Public L would have increased its ownership interest in L by 30 percentage points if it were treated as having acquired L common stock pursuant to the conversion of the L debentures. The increase in New Public L's ownership, taken together with P1's 21 percentage point ownership increase in L during the testing period [210,000 shares deemed converted/(700,000 (actual) + 300,000 (deemed) shares outstanding)], results in an ownership change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Transactions identified in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Any transaction that is designated by the International Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin shall be subject to the rules, as provided in such bulletin, similar to the rules described in this paragraph (j)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Issuance of rights to acquire loss corporation stock--(1) In general. In the case of any transaction that is described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), (D) or (E) of this section in which the loss corporation issues rights to acquire its stock to the members of more than one public group, those rights shall be presumed to be exercised pro rata by each such public group as those rights are actually exercised. See Sec. 1.382-3(j)(10) for an exception to the application of the rule of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(F)(1) to stock issued on the exercise of a transferable option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L, which has six million shares outstanding, is owned entirely by Public L and P is owned entirely by Public P. On November 30, 1988, P merges into L in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(A) with Public P receiving four million shares of L stock as a result of the reorganization. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, Public L and Public P continue to be treated as separate public groups following the merger. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, L also issues an amount of warrants in L stock pro rata to Public L and Public P that, if exercised, would result in the issuance of an additional two million shares of L stock. On November 30, 1989, when only one-half of the outstanding warrants have been exercised, A acquires all of the unexercised warrants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Without regard to the warrants distributed in reorganization, Public P's ownership interest in L increases by 40 percentage points on November 30, 1988, relative to its lowest ownership interest in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger). For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on November 30, 1988, the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (D) of this section does not require that a third direct public group be separately identified and treated as acquiring the warrants, because L has actual knowledge that Public L and Public P acquired the distributed warrants in proportion to their respective ownership interests in L stock. Because the largest increase in the ownership of L on the testing date results from treating only Public P as exercising the distributing warrants, in which event, its ownership interest would increase by 44.4 percentage points ([four million shares acquired in the merger + 800,000 shares deemed acquired]/10.8 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding), the

issuance of the warrants by L does not cause an ownership change on November 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(F)(1) of this section, each actual exercise of warrants to acquire one million shares of L stock between November 30, 1988 and November 30, 1989 is treated as made pro rata by Public L and Public P (600,000 shares to Public L and 400,000 shares to Public P). Accordingly, as a result of the actual exercises of warrants during that period the ownership interests of the only 5-percent shareholders, Public L and Public P, are proportionately increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A's acquisition of the all of the outstanding warrants on November 30, 1989 requires the determination whether there has been an ownership change with respect to L, because A would be 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section owning 8\1/3\ percent of the L stock if the acquired warrants were exercised (one million shares deemed acquired/12 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding). See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, A is not treated as having exercised those warrants, because an ownership change would not results. (Public P's 36\2/3\ percentage point increase [(four million shares acquired in the merger + 400,000 shares deemed acquired)/12 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding] and A's 8\1/3\ percentage point increase is not greater than 50 percentage points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Combination of de minimis public groups--(A) In general.

L's taxable year ends on December 31. On January 1, 1989, L issues a class of debt maturing on December 31, 2019 (``Class A Debentures'') with respect to which it will semi-annually issue L stock in discharge of its interest obligation. In addition, L issues an amount of L stock to the public in two separate transactions during 1989. As a percentage of the L stock outstanding at the close of L's taxable year on December 31, 1989, L issued .45 percent of its stock on each of two dates in payment of interest with respect to the Class A Debentures, 4.5 percent of its stock in the first stock offering and six percent of its stock in the second stock offering. During 1990, L did not issue stock other than in payment of interest with respect to the Class A Debentures. As a percentage of L stock outstanding on December 31, 1990, L issued .41 percent of its stock on each of two dates during 1990 with respect to its outstanding debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (h)(4)(x)(E) of this section, L's obligation to issue stock in satisfaction of the interest with respect to the Class A Debentures until December 31, 2019, is not subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section and thus is taken into account only as such stock is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section require the identification of at least two additional, separate direct public groups during 1989. First, the persons who acquire six percent of L stock in a public offering to which section 1032 applies must be treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder (``Public 1L''). See paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Even though this group was first identified in 1989, it may not be combined with other public groups also first identified in 1989 because it owns five percent or more of L stock. Second, although each of the three other issuances of L stock during the year ordinarily result in the identification of an additional, separate direct public group, each such direct public group may be combined with the two other such groups into a single public group (``Public 2L''). As of the end of 1989, Public 2L would own a total of 5.4 percent of the stock of L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section require the identification of at least one additional, direct public group during 1990. Because each additional, direct public group first identified in 1990 acquires less than five percent of L stock, they may be combined into a single public group (``Public 3L'') owning .82 percent of the stock of L. Public 3L is treated as a five percent shareholder even though it owns less than five percent of the stock of L. See paragraph (j)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Multiple transactions--(A) In general. If a transaction (or any part thereof) is described by more than one subdivision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, each such subdivision shall apply to the transaction (or each part of the transaction) in the manner that results in the largest increase in the percentage stock ownership by the 5-percent shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a transaction (or any part thereof) is described by more than one subdivision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, each such subdivision shall apply to the transaction (or each part of the transaction) in the manner that results in the largest increase in the percentage stock ownership by the 5-percent shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of the common stock of L is owned by 1,000 unrelated persons, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the L

stock (``Public CL''). L has outstanding a class of preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4) that is owned in equal amounts by 500 unrelated persons (``Public PL'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On September 4, 1988, L rearranges its capital structure by redeeming 70 percent of the common stock owned by 700 of the shareholders in exchange for cash. In addition, all of the preferred stock is exchanged for a new class of common stock (nonvoting) representing 40 percent of the value of L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to the part of the transaction that is treated as a redemption under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section (the exchange of common stock for cash), Public CL is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the owners of the redeemed stock (``Public RCL'') are treated as part of a public group that is separate from the public group comprised of the owners of the stock that is not redeemed (``Public CCL''). As a result of the redemption, Public CCL's percentage ownership interest in L thus increases by 30 percentage points from 30 percent to 60 percent (taking into account all transactions occurring on the testing date, because the change in ownership is measured under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section by reference to each 5-percent shareholder's ownership interest immediately after the testing date). In addition, the exchange of preferred stock for nonvoting common stock is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Under paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section, the part of the transaction to which section 1032 applies is also subject to the segregation rules in the manner specified in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, Public PL, the direct public group that acquires L nonvoting common stock in exchange for L preferred stock, must be treated as a separate public group from the other direct public groups, Public CCL and Public RCL. As a separate public group, Public PL's percentage stock ownership in L increases by 40 points (as compared to 0 percent prior to the transaction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In summary, Public CCL increases its percentage ownership in L by 30 percentage points and Public PL increases its percentage ownership by 40 percentage points. Consequently, an ownership change occurs with respect to L on September 4, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Acquisitions made by either a 5-percent shareholder or the loss corporation following application of the segregation rules. Unless a different proportion is established by either the loss corporation or the Internal Revenue Service, the acquisition of loss corporation stock by either a 5-percent shareholder or the loss corporation on any date on which more than one public group of the loss corporation exists by virtue of the application of the rules of this paragraph (j)(2) shall be treated as being made proportionately from each public group existing immediately before such acquisition. See paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section for the application of this paragraph to the ownership interest of a 5-percent shareholder that owns less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation on the testing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Segregation rules applicable to transactions involving first tier entities or higher tier entities--(i) Dispositions. If a loss corporation is owned, in whole or in part, by a public group (or groups), the rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section shall apply to any transaction in which a first tier entity or an individual that owns a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation of five percent or more transfers a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation to public shareholders. Therefore, each direct public group that exists immediately after such a disposition shall be segregated so that the ownership interests of each public group that existed immediately before the transaction are treated separately from the public group that acquires stock of the loss corporation as a result of the disposition by the individual or first tier entity. The principles of this paragraph (j)(3)(i) shall also apply to transactions in which an ownership interest in a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) or a first tier entity is transferred to a public owner or 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dispositions. If a loss corporation is owned, in whole or in part, by a public group (or groups), the rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section shall apply to any transaction in which a first tier entity or an individual that owns a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation of five percent or more transfers a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation to public shareholders. Therefore, each direct public group that exists immediately after such a disposition shall be segregated so that the ownership interests of each public group that existed immediately before the transaction are treated separately from the public group that acquires stock of the loss corporation as a result of the disposition by the individual or first tier entity. The principles of this paragraph (j)(3)(i) shall also apply to transactions in which an ownership interest in a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) or a first tier entity is transferred to a public owner or 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> L is owned equally by Public L, P and E. Public L consists of 150 equal, unrelated shareholders. P is owned by Public P, a group consisting of 1,500 equal, unrelated shareholders. E is a partnership and none of its partners are 5-percent owners. On October 22, 1988, E sells its entire interest in L over a public stock exchange. No individual or entity acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as the result of E's disposition of the L stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The disposition of the L stock by E is a transaction that causes the segregation of L's direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction (Public L)

from the direct public group that acquires L stock in the transaction (Public EL). As a result, L has three 5-percent shareholders, Public L, Public P (through the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section) and Public EL, each of which owns 33\1/3\ percent of L stock. Therefore, Public EL is a 5-percent shareholder that has increased its ownership interest in L by 33\1/3\ percentage points during the testing period. For purposes of subsequent transactions, Public L and Public EL will continue to be treated as separate direct public groups until any subsequent testing date that does not have a testing period that includes E's disposition of L stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other transactions affecting direct public groups of a first tier entity or higher tier entity. The rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section shall apply to transactions described in such paragraphs that involve either a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) or a first tier entity. In applying those rules for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3)(iii), each direct public group of a first tier entity or a higher tier entity is any public group of any such entity identified in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section or resulting from the application of this paragraph (j)(3)(iii). The principles of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section also shall apply to any transaction that has the effect of a redemption-type transaction (e.g., an acquisition by the loss corporation of stock in a first tier entity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The facts are the same as in Example 1 of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, except that Public L and P1 own 40 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the stock of HC which, in turn, owns 100 percent of L and HC merges into P2. Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section apply to segregate HC's direct public group (Public L) immediately before the merger from the direct public group (Public P2) that acquires loss corporation stock in the merger. The consequences of the merger of HC into P2 are thus the same as in Example (1) of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Twenty-five individual shareholders each own four percent of L (``Public L''). Public L is therefore the only 5-percent shareholder of L. Each of the shareholders of L contribute their L stock to a newly formed corporation, HC. In exchange for their contribution of L stock, HC issues 100 percent of each of its two classes of common stock (voting and nonvoting).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The formation of HC, a first tier entity of L, is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) and (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are applied to this transaction with the result that the shareholders of HC, immediately after the issuance of HC stock, are presumed not to include any persons that previously had a direct or indirect ownership interest in L. The presumption underlying those rules, however, is rebutted by establishing that all of the HC stock outstanding immediately after the transaction was issued solely in exchange for L stock. Thus, Public HC (immediately after the transaction) and Public L (immediately before the transaction) would be treated owned by the same direct public group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of the stock of L is owned by unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of L stock. P also is owned by unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P stock. On November 22, 1988, P incorporates P1 with a contribution of P stock. Immediately thereafter, P1 acquires all of the properties of L in exchange for its P stock in a forward triangular merger qualifying under sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). The P stock transferred by P1 equals 45 percent of the total outstanding P stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Immediately before the merger of L into P1, P's only 5-percent shareholder was Public P, a direct public group of P. The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section thus apply to the transaction under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section since P, a first tier entity, is a party to the reorganization described in such paragraph. Although Public P does not acquire any stock in the merger, it is treated as acquiring stock in the loss corporation, P1, because such corporation succeeds to the pre-change losses of L in a transaction to which 381(a) applies. As a result of the merger, Public P, the direct public group of P that exists immediately before the merger, must be segregated from the direct public groups acquiring P stock in the reorganization. Public P is, therefore, treated as acquiring 55 percent of the outstanding stock of the loss corporation, P1, in the transaction. The transaction, therefore, results in an ownership change for P1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L is owned 20 percent by A and 80 percent by 1,000 unrelated individuals and entities, none of whom owns as much as five percent of L stock (``Public L''). P is owned 10 percent by B, 40 percent by E, and 50 percent by 5,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent

of P stock (``Public P''). E is owned 30 percent by C and 70 percent by 30 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of E (``Public E'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On October 31, 1987, P acquires all of the L stock from A and Public L in exchange for P stock representing 20 percent of the value of P (determined immediately after the acquisition) in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). After the acquisition, P is owned eight percent by B, 32 percent by E, four percent by A, and 56 percent by 6,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P. Because L is wholly owned by P immediately after the acquisition, L, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, is treated as owned as follows: Eight percent by B, 9.6 percent by C (through C's ownership interest in E, a highest tier entity, and E's ownership interest in P, a first tier entity), 22.4 percent by Public E (through its ownership interest in E and E's ownership interest in P), four percent by A, and 56 percent by the shareholders who each own less than five percent of L through their ownership interest in P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section apply to the reorganization since the transaction involved a first tier entity of L. Thus, the direct public group of P that exists immediately after the transaction must be segregated into two public groups--the direct public group of P that existed immediately before the acquisition (Public P) is treated separately from the direct public group consisting of the persons who acquire P stock in the transaction (Public L). Accordingly, immediately after the reorganization, Public P and Public L own 40 percent and 16 percent of L, respectively. See paragraph (h) of this section. (Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, L may treat the four percent of L stock owned by A immediately after the reorganization as the amount of L stock owned by A for each subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the reorganization.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In summary, after applying the rules of paragraphs (j)(1) and (3) of this section, L is treated as owned as follows:

With respect to loss corporation stock that is described in Rule 13d-1(d) of Regulation 13D-G (or any rule or regulation to generally the same effect), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``registered stock''), a loss corporation may rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedules 13D and 13G (or any similar schedules) as of any date to identify all of the corporation's shareholders who have a direct ownership interest of five percent or more (both individuals and first tier entities) on such date. A loss corporation may similarly rely on the existence and absence of such filings as of any date with respect to registered stock of any first tier entity or any higher tier entity to identify the 5-percent owners of any such entities on such date who indirectly own five percent or more of the loss corporation stock, and are thus 5-percent shareholders, and to identify any higher tier entities of such entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statements under penalties of perjury. A loss corporation may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of

A loss corporation may not rely on such a statement (A) that it knows to be false or (B) that is made by either a first tier entity or higher tier entity that owns 50 percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation.

the loss corporation must take such stock ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change has occurred on that testing date. If a loss corporation acquires such knowledge after such income tax return is filed, the loss corporation may take such ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on that testing date and, if appropriate, file an amended income tax return (subject to any applicable statute of limitations). To the extent the loss corporation has actual knowledge on or after any testing date regarding the ownership interest in the loss corporation by members of one public group (described in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section) and the ownership interest of those members in the loss corporation as members in another such public group, the loss corporation may take such ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on that testing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Duty to inquire as to actual stock ownership in the loss corporation.

On February 1, 1989, B acquires a 15 percent interest in L pursuant to a program in which each of four corporations, P1 through P4, each of which is wholly-owned by B, acquire a 3.75 percent interest in L. A principal purpose of acquiring the L stock through four corporations is to avoid treating B as owning any ownership interest in L amounting to as much as five percent, and thus to circumvent the section 382 limitation by avoiding an ownership change. Under paragraph (k)(4) of this section, the limitation on the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are disregarded and B is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 15 percent of the stock of L by virtue of his ownership interests in P1 through P4, notwithstanding paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section (and the application of those rules by virtue of paragraph (j)(3) of this section) shall not apply to a public offering of stock by a domestic building and loan association described in section 591 (or any corporation that owns stock in the association meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)) prior to January 1, 1989. In the case of any transaction described in the preceding sentence, any transitory ownership of stock by any entity that is an underwriter shall be disregarded so that the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall not apply to treat such stock as owned by the owners of the underwriter and thus the rules of paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to the disposition of such stock by the underwriter. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(7)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ownership shall be considered transitory only with respect to an underwriter acquiring stock in a firm commitment underwriting to the extent the stock is disposed of pursuant to the offer (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the initial offering) and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent a transaction may be described both by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and any other provision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) or (3) of this section, paragraph (j)(2)(v)(A) of this section shall not apply and the transaction shall be treated as described solely by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transactions not subject to section 382--(i) Application of old section 382. Old section 382 shall not apply to a loss corporation on or after the date on which an ownership change occurs, but only if such ownership change results in the application of the section 382 limitation (as defined in section 382(b)) with respect to the loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of old section 382. Old section 382 shall not apply to a loss corporation on or after the date on which an ownership change occurs, but only if such ownership change results in the application of the section 382 limitation (as defined in section 382(b)) with respect to the loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effect on testing period. The application of old section 382 to a transaction is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section unless the transaction that results in such application is the last component of an ownership change after May 5, 1986 that is not subject to section 382 under the effective date rules of this paragraph (m) (e.g., an ownership change occurring as the result of an individual's purchase of more than 50 percent of L stock on any date on or before December 31, 1986).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Termination of old section 382. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Options issued or transferred before January 1, 1987--(i) Options issued before May 6, 1986. An option issued before May 6, 1986, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section only if it is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised) on or after such date. In all other cases, such an option shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, but shall be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section. Thus, for example, a warrant to acquire stock of the loss corporation issued before May 6, 1986 shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4) of this section unless the warrant is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder. The exercise of such a warrant, however, would be taken into account as required by this paragraph (m)(8)(i) and paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Options issued before May 6, 1986.

In all other cases, such an option shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, but shall be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section.

An option issued or transferred on or after September 18, 1986, and before January 1, 1987, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, except that the option shall be treated

for purposes of this section as if it never had been issued in the event that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The option lapses unexercised or is irrevocably forfeited by the holder thereof, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On the date the option was issued, there was no significant likelihood that such option would be exercised within the five-year period from the date of such issuance and a purpose for the issuance of the option was to cause an ownership change prior to January 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (m) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A owns all 100 outstanding shares of L stock. A sells 11 shares to B on January 1, 1986. The January 1, 1986 testing date is disregarded under paragraph (m)(3) of this section. A sells another 40 shares to B on January 1, 1988. B's second stock purchase is an owner shift that does not result in an ownership change. B's percentage ownership interest on the testing date (51 percent) is only 40 percentage points greater than the lowest percentage of L stock owned by B at any time during the testing period (11 percent on and after May 6, 1986).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in (i). In addition A sells 20 shares of his L stock to C on July 1, 1990. C's stock purchase is an owner shift. Because B and C together have increased their respective ownership interests in L by 40 and 20 percentage points relative to their lowest percentage stock ownership interests in L at any time during the testing period, C's purchase causes an ownership change. The testing period for any subsequent ownership change begins on the first day following C's acquisition, July 2, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C has owned 100 percent of L since March 22, 1980. On October 13, 1986, P merges into L. As a result of the merger, 40 percent of L stock is acquired by A, the sole shareholder of P. The merger of P into L is both an equity structure shift and an owner shift. The transaction, however, is not an ownership change with respect to L, because A's percentage ownership interest has increased by only 40 percentage points. On August 22, 1987, B purchases 15 percent of the L stock from C. B's purchase constitutes an owner shift resulting in an ownership change that is subject to section 382 because the aggregate increases in percentage ownership by B and C (respectively 40 percent and 15 percent) is more than 50 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in (i), except that the plan of reorganization is adopted on October 13, 1986, and the merger is completed on July 22, 1987. The result is the same as in (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts are the same as in (ii), except that the reorganization is completed on August 22, 1987, and B's purchase of the L stock occurs one month earlier, on July 22, 1987. Assume that after the reorganization on August 22, 1987, A and B own 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of L stock. Although the merger occurred pursuant to a plan of reorganization adopted before 1987, L is subject to section 382 following the equity structure shift, because the merger would not have caused an ownership change if it had been completed in 1986 after the commencement of the L's testing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The facts are the same as in (ii), except that B's purchase occurs on June 7, 1986. Assume that immediately after the reorganization on August 22, 1987, A and B own 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of L stock. Since the reorganization pursuant to a plan adopted before 1987, taken together with the other shifts in the ownership of L's stock between May 5, 1986, and December 31, 1986, would have caused an ownership change, section 382 does not apply as a result of the merger. Since an ownership change occurs as a result of the merger, L's testing period for purposes of any subsequent ownership change begins on October 14, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The facts are the same as in (iv), except that B makes an additional purchase from C of one percent of L's stock on February 14, 1987. The result is the same as in (iv). B's additional purchase, however, is taken into account for the purpose of determining whether there is a second ownership change with respect to L.
