The components shall search all relevant record systems within their  cognizance and shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether a responsive record exists in a system of  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine whether access must be denied and on what legal basis.  An individual may be denied access to his records under the Privacy Act  only if an exemption has been properly claimed for all or part of the  records or information requested; or if the information was compiled in  reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approve the disclosure of records for which they are the  originator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Forward to the PA Coordinator all records approved for release  or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or  interested party as well as notification of the specific determination  for any denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When all records have been collected, the PA Coordinator shall  notify the individual of the determination and shall provide an exact  copy of records deemed to be accessible if a copy has been requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an original record is illegible, incomplete, or partially  exempt from release, the PA Coordinator shall explain in terms  understood by the requester the portions of a record that are unclear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If access to requested records, or any portion thereof, is  denied, the PA Coordinator shall inform the requester in writing of the  specific reason(s) for denial, including the specific citation to  appropriate sections of the Privacy Act or other statutes, this and  other NRO regulations, or the Code of Federal Regulations authorizing  denial, and the right to appeal this determination through the NRO  appeal procedure   within 60 calendar days. The denial shall include the date of denial,  the name and title/position of the denial authority, and the address of  the NRO Appeal Authority. Access may be refused when the records are  exempt by the Privacy Act. Usually an individual will not be denied  access to the entire record, but only to those portions to which the  denial of access furthers the purpose for which an exemption was  claimed.</p>
