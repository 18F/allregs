                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All ports that have export inspection facilities which the Administrator

has determined satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are hereby designated as ports of embarkation. A list of designated ports of embarkation can be viewed on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/regulations/vs/iregs/animals/ or obtained from a Veterinary Services area office. Information on area offices is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal--health/area--offices/. All animals, except animals being exported by land to Mexico or Canada, shall be exported through said ports or through ports designated in special cases under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In special cases, other ports may be designated as ports of embarkation by the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, when the exporter can show to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the animals to be exported would suffer undue hardship if they are required to be moved to a port listed as a designated port of embarkation in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Ports shall be designated in special cases as ports of embarkation only if the inspection facilities are approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards for export inspection facilities. Inspection facilities located at ports of embarkation designated under paragraph (a) of this section, and inspection facilities designated in special cases under paragraph (b) of this section, shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Materials. Floors of pens, alleys, and chutes shall be made of impervious materials and finished so as to be skid-resistant. Impervious floors are those constructed of a material that resists the absorption of fluids. Such materials include concrete, asphalt, brick, metal, or other synthetic material that may be cleaned and disinfected. Fences, gates, and other parts of the facility shall be constructed of wood, metal, or other material that will securely restrain the animals in a safe and humane manner. The facility shall have a roof adequate to protect the animals from inclement weather over at least three-fourths of the pens and alleys and over all of the inspection area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Size. The facility shall be large enough to accommodate all the animals in a single export shipment at one time. A minimum space twice the rate required per animal in Sec. 91.25(b) shall be provided for each animal. Facilities that inspect horses must have ceilings at least 12 feet high in any areas where horses are inspected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection implements. The facility shall have a separate area available for inspection and identification of the animals. Pens and animal restraining devices shall be provided in this area which are sufficient for the inspection and identification of each animal. Pens or yards shall be provided for appropriate segregation, treatment, or both, of animals of questionable health status apart from animals qualified for exportation under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cleaning and disinfection. The facility and equipment shall be cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant permitted under Sec. 71.10 of this chapter under the supervision of a Federal inspector prior to entry of each export shipment into the export inspection facility. Personnel tending the animals shall, if they come in contact with animals outside of the facility, be required to change or sanitize their outer clothing and footwear. All facilities must have running water available to wash and disinfect the facilities. On and after March 23, 1995, facilities to be approved must have a drainage system; and, on and after March 23, 1997, every facility approved before March 23, 1995, must have a drainage system. The drainage system must control surface drainage into or from the facility in a manner that prevents any significant risk of livestock diseases being spread into or from the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Feed and water. An ample supply of running, potable water shall be made available to the animals intended for export, and in cold weather such water shall be kept free of ice. Feed and feeding facilities appropriate for the animals intended for export shall be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Access; approval of arrangements. Access to all parts of the facility shall be allowed to an inspector at all times, day or night, and the arrangement for

handling the animals shall be subject to the approval of the inspector. Approval shall be granted by the inspector if he finds that such arrangements will not permit the dissemination of communicable diseases of livestock to the animals in the export shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Testing and treatment. Testing and treatment of animals in export inspection facilities shall be performed by an accredited veterinarian under the supervision of an APHIS veterinarian. Tests related to APHIS animal disease programs shall be performed in accordance with the Recommended Brucellosis Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Location. The arrangement and location of the facilities shall provide for the isolation of all animals in the facility from contact with any other animals. Isolation of separate export shipments in the facility shall be at the discretion of the inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Disposal of animal wastes. The application for approval of an export inspection facility shall be accompanied by a certification from the authorities having jurisdiction over environmental affairs in the locality of the facility stating that the facility complies with the applicable State and local regulations or ordinances and the requirements, if any, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, regarding disposal of animal wastes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Lighting. The facility shall be equipped with artifical lighting to provide not less than 70 foot candle power in the inspection area and not less than 40 foot candle power in the remainder of the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Office and rest room. A suitable office and adequate rest room facilities shall be provided at the export inspection facility site for use of the inspectors. The facility must have a working telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Walkways. Facilities where horses are inspected must have walkways in front of horse stalls wide enough to allow APHIS personnel to safely remove horses from the stalls for inspection, if necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval and denial or revocation of approval. Approval of each export inspection facility for designation under paragraph (a) of this section, and in special cases under paragraph (b) of this section, shall be obtained from the Administrator. Approval of an export inspection facility under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section will be denied or revoked for failure to meet the standards in paragraph (c) of this section. Designated ports of embarkation and export facilities shall be reevaluated annually, by means of an APHIS site inspection, for continued compliance with the standards contained in paragraph (c) of this section. If the port or facility fails to pass the annual inspection, its designation will be revoked, and it will be removed from the list of designated ports and facilities. A written notice of any proposed denial or revocation shall be given to the operator of the facility, and he or she will be given an opportunity to present his or her views thereon. Such notice shall list in detail the deficiencies concerned. After remedying the deficiencies, an operator may request another inspection. Approval of a port of embarkation in connection with the designation of an export inspection facility in special cases shall be limited to the special case for which the designation was made.
