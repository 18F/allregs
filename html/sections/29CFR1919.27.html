                                Sec. 1919.27  Unit proof tests--winches, derricks and gear accessory thereto.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Winches, with the whole of the gear accessory thereto (including  derricks, goosenecks, eye plates, eye bolts, or other attachments),  shall be tested with a proof load which shall exceed the safe working  load as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Safe working load                        Proof load ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Up to 20 tons............................  25 percent in excess. 20-50 tons...............................  5 tons in excess. Over 50 tons.............................  10 percent in excess. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The proof load shall be lifted with the vessel's normal tackle  with the derrick at an angle not more than 15 degrees to the horizontal,  or, at the designed minimum angle when this is greater, or, when this is  impracticable, at the lowest practicable angle. The angle at which the  test was made shall be stated in the certificate of test. After the  proof load has been lifted, it shall be swung as far as possible in both  directions. In applying the proof load, the design factors of the gear  concerned will determine whether the load is applied with a single part  fall or with a purchase and the certificate of test shall state the  means used. Where winches are fitted with mechanical brakes for manual  operation they shall be demonstrated to be in satisfactory operating  condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of heavy lift derrick barges, proof loads shall be  applied, except as limited by design and stability considerations, at  the maximum and minimum radii for which designed, as well as at any  intermediate radius which the surveyor may deem necessary, and shall be  swung as far as possible in both directions. Data with   respect to each proof load applied shall be entered in the test  certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No items of cargo gear furnished by outside sources shall be  used as a part of the vessel's gear for the purpose of accomplishing the  proof test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All tests prescribed by this section should in general be  carried out by dead load, except that in the case of quadrennial tests,  replacements, or renewals, spring or hydraulic balances may be used  where dead loads are not reasonably available. However, no exception  shall be allowed in the case of gear on new vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The test shall not be regarded as satisfactory unless the  indicator remains constant under the proof load for a period of at least  5 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The safe working load, determined pursuant to the  requirements of this section, shall be applicable only to a swinging  derrick. When using two fixed derricks in ``union purchase'' rigs, the  safe working load should generally be reduced. It is recommended that  owners obtain union purchase safe working load certification based upon  design study and analysis by, or acceptable to, a qualified technical  office of an accredited gear certification agency, with the recognition  that such determinations are valid only for the conditions contemplated  in the analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where both guys and preventers are fitted, union purchase  certification shall state whether the guy or the preventer is the  working strength member, when the guy is for slewing only, and when the  guy and preventer should share working loads as far as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When necessary in the proof testing of heavy derricks, the  appropriate shrouds and stays shall be rigged.</p>
