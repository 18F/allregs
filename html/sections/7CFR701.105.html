Further, in making such determinations, information may be obtained and used from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or any other Federal, State (including State agencies or political subdivisions), or other entity or individual providing information regarding, for

example, flood susceptibility for the land, soil surveys, aerial photographs, or flood plain data or other relevant information.
