                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Historical data. Carriers and conferences shall maintain the data that appeared in their tariff publication systems for a period of five (5) years from the date such information is superseded, canceled or withdrawn, and shall provide on-line access to such data for two (2) years. After two (2) years, such data may be retained on-line or in other electronic form, and shall be made available to any person or the

Commission upon request in a reasonable period of time. Carriers and conferences may charge a reasonable fee for the provision of historical data, not to exceed the fees for obtaining such data on-line. No fee shall apply to federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access date capability. Each tariff shall provide the capability for a retriever to enter an access date, i.e., a specific date for the retrieval of tariff data, so that only data in effect on that date would be directly retrievable. This capability would also align any rate adjustments and assessorial charges that were effective on the access date for rate calculations and designation of applicable surcharges. The access date shall also apply to the alignment of tariff objects for any governing tariffs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic review. The Commission will periodically review published tariff systems and will prohibit the use of any system that fails to meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to systems. Carriers and conferences shall provide the Commission reasonable access to their automated systems and records in order to conduct reviews.</p>
