Equity interests acquired to  prevent a loss upon a debt previously contracted in good faith are not  subject to the limitations or procedures of this subpart; however, they  must be disposed of promptly but in no event later than two years after  their acquisition, unless the FDIC authorizes retention for a longer  period.</p>
