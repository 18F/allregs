                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon his or her own initiative, or upon the request of any party  on grounds of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a  determination of fact, the district director may, at any time before one  year from the date of the last payment of benefits, or at any time  before one year after the denial of a claim, reconsider the terms of an  award or denial of benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modification proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with  the provisions of this part as appropriate, except that the claimant and  the operator, or group of operators or the fund, as appropriate, shall  each be entitled to submit no more than one additional chest X-ray  interpretation, one additional pulmonary function test, one additional  arterial blood gas study, and one additional medical report in support  of its affirmative case along with such rebuttal evidence and additional  statements as are authorized by paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of  Sec. 725.414. Modification proceedings shall not be initiated before an  administrative law judge or the Benefits Review Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At the conclusion of modification proceedings before the  district director, the district director may issue a proposed decision  and order (Sec. 725.418) or, if appropriate, deny the claim by reason  of abandonment (Sec. 725.409). In any case in which the district  director has initiated modification proceedings on his own initiative to  alter the terms of an award or denial of benefits issued by an  administrative law judge, the district director shall, at the conclusion  of modification proceedings, forward the claim for a hearing (Sec.  725.421). In any case forwarded for a hearing, the administrative law  judge assigned to hear such case shall consider whether any additional  evidence submitted by the parties demonstrates a change in condition  and, regardless of whether the parties have submitted new evidence,  whether the evidence of record demonstrates a mistake in a determination  of fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An order issued following the conclusion of modification  proceedings may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase or decrease  benefit payments or award benefits. Such order shall not affect any  benefits previously paid, except that an order increasing the amount of  benefits payable based on a finding of a mistake in a determination of  fact may be made effective on the date from which benefits were  determined payable by the terms of an earlier award. In the case of an  award which is decreased, no payment made in excess of the decreased  rate prior to   the date upon which the party requested reconsideration under paragraph  (a) of this section shall be subject to collection or offset under  subpart H of this part, provided the claimant is without fault as  defined by Sec. 725.543. In the case of an award which is decreased  following the initiation of modification by the district director, no  payment made in excess of the decreased rate prior to the date upon  which the district director initiated modification proceedings under  paragraph (a) shall be subject to collection or offset under subpart H  of this part, provided the claimant is without fault as defined by Sec.  725.543. In the case of an award which has become final and is  thereafter terminated, no payment made prior to the date upon which the  party requested reconsideration under paragraph (a) shall be subject to  collection or offset under subpart H of this part. In the case of an  award which has become final and is thereafter terminated following the  initiation of modification by the district director, no payment made  prior to the date upon which the district director initiated  modification proceedings under paragraph (a) shall be subject to  collection or offset under subpart H of this part.</p>
