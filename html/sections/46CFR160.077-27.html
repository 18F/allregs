                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each recreational hybrid PFD sold or offered for sale must be  provided with a pamphlet that a prospective purchaser can read prior to  purchase. The required pamphlet text must be printed verbatim and in the  sequence set out in paragraph (e) of this section. Additional  information, instructions, or illustrations must not be included within  the required text. The type size shall be no smaller than 8-point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each pamphlet must be prominently marked ``Seller, do not remove  pamphlet.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No person may sell or offer for sale any recreational hybrid PFD  unless the pamphlet required by this section is provided with it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The text specified in paragraphs (e)(2) of this section must be  accompanied by illustrations of the types of devices being described.  The illustrations provided must be either photographs or drawings of the  manufacturer's own products or illustrations of other Coast Guard- approved PFDs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For a Type I hybrid PFD intended for recreational use or a Type  II, III, or V recreational hybrid PFD, the pamphlet contents must be as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The text in UL 1517, Section 39, item A;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following text and illustrations:</p><p class="depth3">There Are Five Types of Personal Flotation Devices</p><p class="depth3">This is a Type [insert approved Type] Hybrid Inflatable PFD.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The following types of PFDs are designed to perform as  described in calm water and when the wearer is not wearing any other  flotation material (such as a wetsuit).</p><p class="depth3">Type I--A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and  turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face down position to  a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore greatly increasing  one's chances of survival. The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters,  especially for cruising on waters where rescue may be slow coming, such  as large bodies of water where it is not likely that boats will be  nearby. This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water.  It is reversible and available in only two sizes--Adult (over 40 kg (90  lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes  (designed for all persons in the appropriate category).  [Insert illustration of Type I PFD]</p><p class="depth3">Type II--A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly  backward position in the water. The turning action of a Type II PFD is  less noticeable than the turning action of a Type I PFD and the Type II  PFD will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type  I. The Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I.  This type of PFD is designed to fit a wide range of people for easy  emergency use, and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40  kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23-40 kg (50-90 lb)), and two categories of  Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb).  Additionally, some models are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to  use the Type II where there is a good chance of fast rescue, such as  areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating,  fishing and other water activities.  [Insert illustration of Type II PFD]</p><p class="depth3">Type III--The Type III PFD allows the wearer to tilt backwards in  the water, and the device will maintain the wearer in that position and  will not turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the  wearer   face up. A Type III is generally more comfortable than a Type II, comes  in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use,  and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting,  fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This type PFD normally comes in many  chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are  available. You may also prefer to use the Type III where there is a  probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other  persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.  [Insert illustration of Type III PFD]</p><p class="depth3">Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III--A Type I, II, or III Hybrid  PFD is an inflatable device which is the most comfortable PFD to wear  and has a minimal amount of buoyancy when deflated and significantly  increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual  buoyancy for your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer  with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label.  Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs  must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should  test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions  to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy.  Approximately 90 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type II  or III hybrid inflatable PFD when it is not inflated. However, hybrid  inflatable PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with  enough additional inflation to float the wearer. Almost all boaters will  float while wearing a Type I hybrid inflatable PFD that is not inflated.  The PFD's `performance type' indicates whether it should be used only  where help is nearby, or if it also may be used where help may be slow  coming. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming,  while Types II and III are good only when there is a chance of fast  rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for  persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23-40  kg (50-90 lb); and small child, for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50  lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I  hybrids but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal  adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult and youth sizes  but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal  adult sizes.  [For a pamphlet provided with a Type I, II or III hybrid PFD, insert  illustration of the Type Hybrid PFD being sold]</p><p class="depth3">Type IV--A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who  has fallen overboard so that the person can grasp and hold the device  until rescued. Until May 15, 1995 (or May 1, 1996 at commercial  liveries), the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in  certain instances. However, this type is suitable only where there is a  good chance of quick rescue, such as areas where it is common for other  persons to be nearby engaged in boating, fishing, and other water  activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.  [Insert illustration of Type IV PFD]</p><p class="depth3">Type V (General)--A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses  or activities such as boardsailing, or commercial white water rafting.  These PFDs are not suitable for other boating activities. The label on  the PFD indicates the kinds of activities for which the PFD may be used  and whether there are limitations on how it may be used.</p><p class="depth3">Type V Hybrid--A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can  be the most comfortable and has very little buoyancy when it is not  inflated, and considerably more buoyancy when it is inflated. In order  for the device to count toward carriage requirements on recreational  boats, it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the  user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar to the  action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is  indicated on the label). This type of PFD is more comfortable because it  is less bulky when it is not inflated. Boaters taking advantage of the  extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must take additional care in the  use of these devices. Boaters should test their hybrid PFDs in the  water, under safe, controlled conditions to know how well the devices  float them with limited buoyancy. Approximately 70 percent of boaters  will float while wearing a Type V hybrid PFD when the device is not  inflated. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn  with enough additional inflation to float the wearer. The PFD's  ``performance type'' indicates whether it should be used only where help  is nearby, or if it may also be used where help may be slow coming. This  type of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over  40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb), and  may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult  sizes.
