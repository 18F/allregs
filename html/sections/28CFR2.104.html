                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any adverse witness (i.e., a person who has given  information upon which revocation may be based) refuses, upon request by  the Commission, to appear at a probable cause hearing or local  revocation hearing, a Commissioner may issue a subpoena for the  appearance of such witness. Such subpoena may also be issued at the  discretion of a Commissioner in the event such adverse witness is judged  unlikely to appear as requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, a Commissioner may, upon a showing by the parolee  that a witness whose testimony is necessary to the proper disposition of  his case will not appear voluntarily at a local revocation hearing or  provide an adequate written statement of his testimony, issue a subpoena  for the appearance of such witness at the revocation hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such subpoenas may also be issued at the discretion of a  Commissioner if deemed necessary for the orderly processing of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A subpoena issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may  require the production of documents as well as, or in lieu of, a  personal appearance. The subpoena shall specify the time and the place  at which the person named therein is commanded to appear, and shall  specify any documents required to be produced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A subpoena may be served by any Federal or District of Columbia  officer authorized to serve criminal process. The subpoena may be served  at any place within the judicial district in which the place specified  in the subpoena is located, or any place where the witness may be found.  Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by  delivering a copy thereof to such a person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a person refuses to obey such subpoena, the Commission may  petition a court of the United States for the judicial district on which  the parole proceeding is being conducted, or in which such person may be  found, to require such person to appear, testify, or produce evidence.  If the court issues an order requiring such person to appear before the  Commission, failure to obey such an order is punishable as contempt. 18  U.S.C. 4214 (1976).
