                                Sec. 400.1-1  Refiling of notice of tax lien.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Federal Tax Lien Act of  1966 (80 Stat. 1125), effective after November 2, 1966.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirement to refile. In order to continue the effect of a  notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in  paragraph (c) of this section during the required refiling period  (described in paragraph (d) of this section). In the event that two or  more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax  assessment, the failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs  (c)(1)(i) and (d) of this section in respect of one of the notices of  lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of the other  notice or notices of lien. Thus, except for the filing of a notice of  lien required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section relating to a  change of residence, the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is  not affected by the refiling or non-refiling of any other notice of  lien. The effectiveness of a timely refiled notice of lien relates back  to the date on which the notice of lien was effective before the  refiling. If the district director fails to refile a notice of lien in  the manner described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the  notice of lien is not effective, after the expiration of the required  refiling period, as against any person without regard to when the  interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was acquired.  However, the failure of the district director to refile a notice of lien  during the required refiling period will not affect the effectiveness of  the notice with respect to (1) property which is the subject matter of a  suit, to which the United States is a party, commenced prior to the  expiration of the required refiling period, or (2) property which has  been levied upon by the United States prior to the expiration of the  required refiling period. Failure to refile a notice of lien does not  affect the existence of the lien. If a notice of lien is not refiled,  and if the lien is still in existence, the Internal Revenue Service may  nevertheless file a new notice of lien either on the form prescribed for  the filing of a notice of lien or on the form prescribed for refiling a  notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of section  6323(f) and is effective from the date on which such filing is made.  Upon written request of any person who has a proper interest, any  district director may issue a certificate of release of lien if notice  of the lien has not been refiled within the required refiling period and  the entire liability for the tax has been satisfied or has become  unenforceable as a matter of law. Such request should be sent to the  district director for the internal revenue district shown on the notice  of lien. For provisions relating to certificates of release of lien, see  section 6325.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Place for refiling notice of lien--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A notice of  lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph  (d) of this section) shall be effective only--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the  prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the  provisions of section 6323; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> in the State in which such new residence is located  (or, if such new residence is located without the United States, in the  District of Columbia). If on or before such 90th day more than one  written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's  residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed  only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received  on the most recent date. This subdivision is applicable regardless of  whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the  refiling of notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is  completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of change of taxpayer's residence--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except  as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of  this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be  effective only if it is received, in writing, by the Internal Revenue  Service from the taxpayer or his representative, relates to an unpaid  tax liability of the taxpayer, and states the taxpayer's name and  address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary that a  written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by  section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. For purposes  of this subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown  on a return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax)  will not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By return or amended return. For purposes of this section, in  the case of a notice of lien which relates to an assessment of tax made  after December 31, 1966, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence  will also be effective if it is contained in a return or amended return  of the same type of tax filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the  taxpayer which on its face indicates that there is a change in the  taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's name, address of  his new residence, and his identifying number required by section 6109.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other rules applicable. Other than the means specified in  subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, no communication (either  written or oral) to the Internal Revenue Service will be considered  effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this  section, whether or not the Service has actual notice of the taxpayer's  residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of  change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the  notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received  by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of  section 7502.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and  owns real property in N State. Notices of lien are properly filed in M  and N States. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien  filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the  required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office  in M State but is not required to refile the notice of lien with the  appropriate office in N State. Similarly, in order to continue the  effect of the notice of lien filed in N State, the Internal Revenue  Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of  lien with the appropriate office in N State but is not required to  refile the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M State.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State.  Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. One year before the  required refiling period, B establishes his residence in N State, and B  immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in  residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in  M State, the Internal Revenue   Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of  lien with (i) the appropriate office in M State, and (ii) the  appropriate office in N State because B properly notified the Internal  Revenue Service of his change in residence to N State more than 89 days  prior to the date refiling of the notice of lien in M State is  completed. If B did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his  change in residence to N State in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service would not  be required to file a notice of lien in N State, even if the Internal  Revenue Service had actual notice of B's change in residence to N State.  In this latter case, in order to continue the effect of the notice of  lien filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during  the required refiling period, the notice of lien only with the  appropriate office in M State.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of O State.  Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. Four years before the  required refiling period, C establishes his residence in P State, and C  immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in  residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. Three years before the required refiling period, C establishes  his residence in R State, and again C immediately notifies the Internal  Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In order to continue the  effect of the notice of lien filed in O State, the Internal Revenue  Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of  lien with (i) the appropriate office in O State, and (ii) the  appropriate office in R State since the notice received by the Service  of C's change in residence to R State was the most recent notice  received more than 89 days prior to the date refiling in O State is  completed. The notice of lien is not required to be filed in P State,  even though C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his  change in residence to P State, because such notice is not the most  recent one received.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does  not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R  State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in  O State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required  refiling period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O  State, and (ii) the appropriate office in P State because C properly  notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P  State, even though C is not a resident of P State on the date refiling  of the notice of lien in O State is completed. The Internal Revenue  Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R State because C  did not properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R  State.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and  owns real property in N and O States. The Internal Revenue Service  properly files notices of lien in M, N, and O States. Five years and 6  months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, D  establishes his residence in P State, and at that time the Internal  Revenue Service received from D a notification of his change in  residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. On a date which is 5 years and 7 months after the date of the  assessment shown on the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service  properly refiles notices of lien in M, N, and O States which refilings  continue the effect of each of the notices of lien. The Internal Revenue  Service is not required to file a notice of lien in P State because D  did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence  to P State more than 89 days prior to the date each of the refilings in  M, N, and O States was completed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the  refiling of the notice of lien in O State occurs 100 days after D  notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P  State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in  O State, in addition to refiling the notice of lien in O State, the  Internal Revenue Service must also file, during the required refiling  period, a notice of lien in P State because D properly notified the  Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P State more than  89 days prior to the date the refiling in O State was completed.  However, in order to maintain the effect of the refilings in M and N  States, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to file, during the  required refiling period, the notice of lien in P State since D did not  notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P  State more than 89 days prior to the date the refilings in M and N  States were completed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 7. E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of T State.  Because T State has not designated one office in the case of personal  property for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of  section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service properly files a  notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district  court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for those who may have  occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a matter of legal  effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files notice of lien  with the recorder of deeds of the county in T State where E resides. In  addition, the Internal Revenue Service sent a copy of the notice of lien  to the X Life Insurance Company to give the Company actual notice of the  notice of   lien. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien, the  Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling  period, the notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate U.S.  district court. It is not necessary in order to continue the effect of  the notice of the lien to refile the notice of lien with the recorder of  deeds of the county where E resides because the refiling of the notice  of lien with the recorder of deeds does not constitute a proper filing  for the purposes of section 6323(f). In addition, it is not necessary to  continue the effect of the notice of lien under this section to send a  copy of the notice of lien to the X Life Insurance Company because the  sending of a notice of lien to an insurance company does not constitute  a filing for the purposes of section 6323 and, thus, a refiling with an  insurance company is not required under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required refiling period--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For the purpose of  this section, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  (d), the term ``required refiling period'' means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 6 years  after the date of the assessment of the tax, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after  the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of  lien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tax assessments made before January 1, 1962. If the assessment  of the tax is made before January 1, 1962, the first required refiling  period shall be the calendar year 1967. Thus, to maintain the  effectiveness of any notice of lien on file which relates to a lien  which arose before January 1, 1962, the Internal Revenue Service will  refile the notice of lien during the calendar year 1967. The second  required refiling period for any such notice of lien is the calendar  year 1973.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On March 1, 1963, an assessment of tax is made against B,  a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment  arises on that date. On July 1, 1963, a notice of lien is properly  filed. The notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, is effective up to and  including March 31, 1969. The first required refiling period for the  notice of lien begins on April 1, 1968, and ends on March 31, 1969. A  refiling of the notice of lien during that period will extend the  effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, up to and  including March 31, 1975. The second required refiling period for the  notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends on March 31, 1975.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the  Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien during the  first required refiling period (Apr. 1, 1968, through Mar. 31, 1969).  However, a notice of lien which meets the requirements of section  6323(f) is filed on June 2, 1971. Because of this filing, the notice of  lien filed on June 2, 1971, is effective as of June 2, 1971. That notice  must itself be refiled during the 1-year period ending on March 31,  1975, if it is to continue in effect after March 31, 1975. As in example  1, the second required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on  April 1, 1974, and ends on March 31, 1975.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. On April 1, 1960, an assessment of tax is made against B,  a delinquent taxpayer, and a tax lien for the amount of the assessment  arises on that date. On June 1, 1962, a notice of lien is properly  filed. Because the assessment of tax was made before January 1, 1962,  the notice of lien filed on June 1, 1962, is effective up to and  including December 31, 1967. The first required refiling period for the  notice of lien is the calendar year 1967. A refiling of the notice of  lien during 1967 will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien  filed on June 1, 1962, up to and including December 31, 1973. The second  required refiling period for the notice of lien is the calendar year  1973.  [T.D. 6932, 32 FR 14835, Oct. 18, 1967]</p>
