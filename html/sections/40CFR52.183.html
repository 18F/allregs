                            <p class="depth0">The Governor of Arkansas submitted on November 6, 1992, a plan revision to develop and implement a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM) to meet the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan commits to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for small businesses, and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise the program and report to the EPA on the program's effectiveness. On April 23, 1993, the Governor submitted Act 251 of 1993 which establishes the Compliance Advisory Panel for the PROGRAM.
