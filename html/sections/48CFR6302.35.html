                            <p class="depth0">When the Board is unable to proceed with disposition of an appeal  for reasons not within its control, such appeal is placed in a suspense  status. In any case where such suspension has continued, or it appears  that it may continue for a period in excess of one year, the Board may  dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its restoration to the Board's  docket when the cause of suspension has been eliminated. Unless either  party or the Board acts to reinstate any appeal so dismissed within  three years from the date of dismissal, the dismissal is automatically  converted to a dismissal with prejudice without further action by the  parties or the Board.</p>
