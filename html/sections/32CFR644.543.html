                                Sec. 644.543  Determination of acceptable offers after advertising.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally an acceptable offer is one which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is submitted by a responsible bidder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conforms to the Invitation for Bids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Equals or exceeds the appraised fair market value of the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Was independently arrived at in open competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A formal appraisal is not required where real property  components:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are to be offered on a competitive sale basis that will  adequately test the market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are at the same location and are to be sold under a single  advertisement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have a total estimated fair market value of $10,000 or less for  all property to be sold.  The determination as to necessity for a formal appraisal because of the  $10,000 limitation may be made by an experienced real estate employee  who need not be a real estate appraiser. This determination may be in  the form of a simple written statement that in the judgment of the  signer the property is not considered to exceed $10,000 in value. In  these cases, awards will be supported by a determination by the DE that  the market was adequately tested, and the price bid reasonable. For the  purpose of records and reports, the sale price will be recorded as the  fair market value. If it appears the market was not adequately tested,  bids   will be rejected and the property readvertised, or, if time does not  permit readvertising, a sale may be consummated using the procedure  provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All land, irrespective of estimated value, and all other real  property and components with an estimated value in excess of $10,000  will be appraised. Where an acceptable offer, as defined in paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this section, is not received for such property as a  result of public advertising, it will be readvertised unless the  responsible DE determines, based upon written findings which shall be  preserved as part of the permanent file, that further public advertising  will serve no useful purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where no acceptable bid is received as a result of the second  advertising, or a determination was made that further advertising would  serve no useful purpose or is not feasible, the DE may negotiate a sale  at the highest price obtainable, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All bids are first rejected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total of the appraised value for all property included in  any single sales contract does not exceed $1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All past bidders, on any of the items, and any other known  interested parties are afforded a fair opportunity to participate in the  negotiations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The sale price is in excess of the highest bid received as a  result of advertising.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In his opinion the price is reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where the appraised or estimated value of all items to be  included in a single sales contract exceeds $1,000, and no acceptable  bid is received, the high bidder may at the discretion of the DE be  given a reasonable period, not to exceed five working days, to increase  his bid. At the same time all other bids shall be rejected and bid  deposits returned. If the high bidder increases his offer to an amount  equal to the total appraised or estimated value of the items involved,  the DE may consummate the sale. All other cases will be forwarded to  DAEN-REM together with an opinion as to whether the market was  adequately tested and the highest price offered is reasonable, and with  recommendations as to the course of action to be followed. If a  negotiated sale to other than the highest bidder is recommended,  information for preparation of a report to the Government Operations  Committees of Congress will be included, as required in paragraph (c)(2)  of Sec. 644.544.</p>
