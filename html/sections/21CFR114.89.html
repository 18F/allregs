                            <p class="depth0">Whenever any process operation deviates from the scheduled process  for any acidified food and/or the equilibrium pH of the finished product  is higher than 4.6, the commercial processor of the acidified food shall  either: (a) Fully reprocess that portion of the food by a process  established by a competent processing authority as adequate to ensure a  safe product; (b) thermally process it as a low-acid food under part 113  of this chapter; or (c) set aside that portion of the food involved for  further evaluation as to any potential public health significance. The  evaluation shall be made by a competent processing authority and shall  be in accordance with procedures recognized by competent processing  authorities as being adequate to detect any potential hazard to public  health. Unless the evaluation demonstrates that the food has undergone a  process that has rendered it safe, the food set aside shall either be  fully reprocessed to render it safe, or be destroyed. A record shall be  made of the procedures used in the evaluation and the results. Either  upon completion of full reprocessing and the attainment of a safe food,  or after the determination that no significant potential for public  health hazard exists, that portion of the food involved may be shipped  in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the food involved  shall be destroyed.</p>
