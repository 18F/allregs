                                Sec. 821.54  Petition for review of Administrator's determination
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time within which to file petition. A respondent may, within 2  days after the date of receipt of an emergency or other immediately  effective order of the Administrator, file with the Board a petition for  review of the Administrator's determination that an emergency, requiring  the order to be effective immediately, exists. This 2-day time limit is  statutory and the Board has no authority to extend it. If the respondent  has not previously filed an appeal from the Administrator's emergency or  other immediately effective order, the petition shall also be considered  a simultaneously filed appeal from the order under Sec. 821.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form, content and service of petition. The petition may be in  letter form. A copy of the Administrator's order, from which review of  the emergency determination is sought, must be attached to the petition.  If a copy of the order is not attached, the petition will be dismissed.  While the petition need only request that the Board review the  Administrator's determination as to the existence of an emergency  requiring the order be effective immediately, it may also enumerate the  respondent's reasons for believing that the Administrator's emergency  determination is not warranted in the   interest of aviation safety. The respondent may include attachments to  the petition for review (e.g., affidavits, other documents or records)  limited to evidence the respondent believes supports the reasons  enumerated in the petition for why the Administrator's emergency  determination is not warranted in the interest of aviation safety. The  petition must be filed with the Board by overnight delivery service or  facsimile and simultaneously served on the Administrator by the same  means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reply to petition. If the petition enumerates the respondent's  reasons for believing that the Administrator's emergency determination  is unwarranted, the Administrator may, within 2 days after the date of  service of the petition, file a reply, which shall be strictly limited  to matters of rebuttal. No submissions other than the respondent's  petition and the Administrator's reply in rebuttal will be accepted,  except in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hearing. No hearing shall be held on a petition for review of an  emergency determination. However, the law judge may, on his or her own  initiative, and strictly in keeping with the prohibition on ex parte  communications set forth in Sec. 821.61, solicit from the parties  additional information to supplement that previously provided by the  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disposition. Within 5 days after the Board's receipt of the  petition, the chief law judge (or, if the case has been assigned to a  law judge other than the chief law judge, the law judge to whom the case  is assigned) shall dispose of the petition by written order, and, in so  doing, shall consider whether, based on the acts and omissions alleged  in the Administrator's order, and assuming the truth of such factual  allegations, the Administrator's emergency determination was appropriate  under the circumstances, in that it supports a finding that aviation  safety would likely be compromised by a stay of the effectiveness of the  order during the pendency of the respondent's appeal. In making this  determination, however, the law judge is not so limited to the order's  factual allegations themselves, but also shall permit evidence, if  appropriate, pertaining to the propriety of the emergency determination,  presented by the respondent with the petition and the Administrator with  the reply to the petition. This evidence can include affidavits or other  such records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of law judge's ruling. If the law judge grants the  petition, the effectiveness of the Administrator's order shall be stayed  until final disposition of the respondent's appeal by a law judge or by  the Board. In such cases, the remaining provisions of this subpart  (Sec. Sec. 821.55-821.57) shall continue to apply, unless the  respondent, with the Administrator's consent, waives their  applicability. If the petition is denied, the Administrator's order  shall remain in effect, and the remaining provisions of this subpart  shall continue to apply, unless their applicability is waived by the  respondent. The law judge's ruling on the petition shall be final, and  is not appealable to the Board. However, in the event of an appeal to  the Board from a law judge's decision on the merits of the emergency or  other immediately effective order, the Board may, at its discretion,  note, in its order disposing of the appeal, its views on the law judge's  ruling on the petition, and such views shall serve as binding precedent  in all future cases.
