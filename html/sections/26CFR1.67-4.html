                                Sec. 1.67-4  Costs paid or incurred by estates or non-grantor trusts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 67(e) provides an exception to the 2-percent  floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions for costs that are paid or  incurred in connection with the administration of an estate or a trust  not described in Sec. 1.67-2T(g)(1)(i) (a non-grantor trust) and that  would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such  estate or trust. A cost is subject to the 2-percent floor to the extent  that it is included in the definition of miscellaneous itemized  deductions under section 67(b), is incurred by an estate or non-grantor  trust, and commonly or customarily would be incurred by a hypothetical  individual holding the same property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Commonly'' or ``Customarily'' Incurred--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In  analyzing a cost to determine whether it commonly or customarily would  be incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property, it is  the type of product or service rendered to the estate or non-grantor  trust in exchange for the cost, rather than the description of the cost  of that product or service, that is determinative. In addition to the  types of costs described as commonly or customarily incurred by  individuals in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section,  costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals also  include, for example, costs incurred in defense of a claim against the  estate, the decedent, or the non-grantor trust that are unrelated to the  existence, validity, or administration of the estate or trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership costs. Ownership costs are costs that are chargeable  to or incurred by an owner of property simply by reason of being the  owner of the property. Thus, for purposes of section 67(e), ownership  costs are commonly or customarily incurred by a hypothetical individual  owner of such property. Such ownership costs include, but are not  limited to, partnership costs   deemed to be passed through to and reportable by a partner if these  costs are defined as miscellaneous itemized deductions pursuant to  section 67(b), condominium fees, insurance premiums, maintenance and  lawn services, and automobile registration and insurance costs. Other  expenses incurred merely by reason of the ownership of property may be  fully deductible under other provisions of the Code, such as sections  62(a)(4), 162, or 164(a), which would not be miscellaneous itemized  deductions subject to section 67(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax preparation fees. Costs relating to all estate and  generation-skipping transfer tax returns, fiduciary income tax returns,  and the decedent's final individual income tax returns are not subject  to the 2-percent floor. The costs of preparing all other tax returns  (for example, gift tax returns) are costs commonly and customarily  incurred by individuals and thus are subject to the 2-percent floor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Investment advisory fees. Fees for investment advice (including  any related services that would be provided to any individual investor  as part of an investment advisory fee) are incurred commonly or  customarily by a hypothetical individual investor and therefore are  subject to the 2-percent floor. However, certain incremental costs of  investment advice beyond the amount that normally would be charged to an  individual investor are not subject to the 2-percent floor. For this  purpose, such an incremental cost is a special, additional charge that  is added solely because the investment advice is rendered to a trust or  estate rather than to an individual or attributable to an unusual  investment objective or the need for a specialized balancing of the  interests of various parties (beyond the usual balancing of the varying  interests of current beneficiaries and remaindermen) such that a  reasonable comparison with individual investors would be improper. The  portion of the investment advisory fees not subject to the 2-percent  floor by reason of the preceding sentence is limited to the amount of  those fees, if any, that exceeds the fees normally charged to an  individual investor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appraisal fees. Appraisal fees incurred by an estate or a non- grantor trust to determine the fair market value of assets as of the  decedent's date of death (or the alternate valuation date), to determine  value for purposes of making distributions, or as otherwise required to  properly prepare the estate's or trust's tax returns, or a generation- skipping transfer tax return, are not incurred commonly or customarily  by an individual and thus are not subject to the 2-percent floor. The  cost of appraisals for other purposes (for example, insurance) is  commonly or customarily incurred by individuals and is subject to the 2- percent floor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certain fiduciary expenses. Certain other fiduciary expenses are  not commonly or customarily incurred by individuals, and thus are not  subject to the 2-percent floor. Such expenses include without limitation  the following: Probate court fees and costs; fiduciary bond premiums;  legal publication costs of notices to creditors or heirs; the cost of  certified copies of the decedent's death certificate; and costs related  to fiduciary accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bundled fees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If an estate or a non-grantor  trust pays a single fee, commission, or other expense (such as a  fiduciary's commission, attorney's fee, or accountant's fee) for both  costs that are subject to the 2-percent floor and costs (in more than a  de minimis amount) that are not, then, except to the extent provided  otherwise by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the  single fee, commission, or other expense (bundled fee) must be  allocated, for purposes of computing the adjusted gross income of the  estate or non-grantor trust in compliance with section 67(e), between  the costs that are subject to the 2-percent floor and those that are  not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. If a bundled fee is not computed on an hourly basis,  only the portion of that fee that is attributable to investment advice  is subject to the 2-percent floor; the remaining portion is not subject  to that floor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenses not subject to allocation. Out-of-pocket expenses  billed to the estate or non-grantor trust are treated as separate from  the bundled fee. In addition, payments made from the bundled fee to  third parties that would have been subject to the 2-percent floor if   they had been paid directly by the estate or non-grantor trust are  subject to the 2-percent floor, as are any fees or expenses separately  assessed by the fiduciary or other payee of the bundled fee (in addition  to the usual or basic bundled fee) for services rendered to the estate  or non-grantor trust that are commonly or customarily incurred by an  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable method. Any reasonable method may be used to allocate  a bundled fee between those costs that are subject to the 2-percent  floor and those costs that are not, including without limitation the  allocation of a portion of a fiduciary commission that is a bundled fee  to investment advice. Facts that may be considered in determining  whether an allocation is reasonable include, but are not limited to, the  percentage of the value of the corpus subject to investment advice,  whether a third party advisor would have charged a comparable fee for  similar advisory services, and the amount of the fiduciary's attention  to the trust or estate that is devoted to investment advice as compared  to dealings with beneficiaries and distribution decisions and other  fiduciary functions. The reasonable method standard does not apply to  determine the portion of the bundled fee attributable to payments made  to third parties for expenses subject to the 2-percent floor or to any  other separately assessed expense commonly or customarily incurred by an  individual, because those payments and expenses are readily identifiable  without any discretion on the part of the fiduciary or return preparer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2014.
