With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a  combined license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement  activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with design,  procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though  the NRC may not have found that any one of the prescribed acceptance  criteria are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Licensee notifications--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ITAAC closure notification. The  licensee shall notify the NRC that prescribed inspections, tests, and  analyses have been performed and that the prescribed acceptance criteria  are met.

Following the licensee's ITAAC  closure notifications under paragraph (c)(1) of this section until the  Commission makes the finding under 10 CFR 52.103(g), the licensee shall  notify the NRC, in a timely manner, of new information that materially  alters the basis for determining that either inspections, tests, or  analyses were performed as required, or that acceptance criteria are  met.

If the licensee has not  provided, by the date 225 days before the scheduled date for initial  loading of fuel, the notification required by paragraph (c)(1) of this  section for all ITAAC, then the licensee shall notify the NRC that the  prescribed inspections, tests, or analyses for all uncompleted ITAAC  will be performed and that the prescribed acceptance criteria will be  met prior to operation. The notification must be provided no later than  the date 225 days before the scheduled date for initial loading of fuel,  and must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the  prescribed inspections, tests, or analyses will be performed and the  prescribed acceptance criteria for the uncompleted ITAAC will be met,  including, but not limited to, a description of the specific procedures  and analytical methods to be used for performing the prescribed  inspections, tests, and analyses and determining that the prescribed  acceptance criteria are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All ITAAC complete notification. The licensee shall notify the  NRC that all ITAAC are complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Licensee determination of non-compliance with ITAAC. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the  event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC derived from a referenced  standard design certification and the licensee has not demonstrated that  the prescribed acceptance criteria are met, the licensee may take  corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC or request an  exemption from the standard design certification ITAAC, as applicable. A  request for an exemption must also be accompanied by a request for a  license amendment under 10 CFR 52.98(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC not derived  from a referenced standard design certification and the licensee has not  demonstrated that the prescribed acceptance criteria are met, the  licensee may take corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC  or request a license amendment under 10 CFR 52.98(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NRC inspection, publication of notices, and availability of  licensee notifications. The NRC shall ensure that the prescribed  inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC are performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At appropriate intervals until the last date for submission of  requests for hearing under 10 CFR 52.103(a), the NRC shall publish  notices in the Federal Register of the NRC staff's determination of the  successful completion of inspections, tests, and analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NRC shall make publicly available the licensee notifications  under paragraph (c) of this section. The NRC shall, no later than the  date of publication of the notice of intended operation required by 10  CFR 52.103(a), make publicly available those licensee notifications  under paragraph (c) of this section that have been submitted to the NRC  at least seven (7) days before that notice.
