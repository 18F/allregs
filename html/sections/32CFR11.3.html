                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background. The following crimes and elements thereof are intended for use by military commissions established pursuant to 32 CFR part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' the jurisdiction of which extends to offenses or offenders that by statute or the law of armed

conflict may be tried by military commission as limited by Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism.'' No offense is cognizable in a trial by military commission if that offense did not exist prior to the conduct in question. These crimes and elements derive from the law of armed conflict, a body of law that is sometimes referred to as the law of war. They constitute violations of the law of armed conflict or offenses that, consistent with that body of law, are triable by military commission. Because this document is declarative of existing law, it does not preclude trial for crimes that occurred prior to its effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of other laws. No conclusion regarding the applicability or persuasive authority of other bodies of law should be drawn solely from the presence, absence, or similarity of particular language in this part as compared to other articulations of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-exclusivity. This part does not contain a comprehensive list of crimes triable by military commission. It is intended to be illustrative of applicable principles of the common law of war but not to provide an exclusive enumeration of the punishable acts recognized as such by that law. The absence of a particular offense from the corpus of those enumerated herein does not preclude trial for that offense.</p>
