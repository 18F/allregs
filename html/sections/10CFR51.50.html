                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction permit stage. Each applicant for a permit to  construct a production or utilization facility covered by Sec. 51.20  shall submit with its application a separate document, entitled  ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Construction Permit Stage,'' which  shall contain the information specified in Sec. Sec. 51.45, 51.51, and  51.52. Each environmental report shall identify procedures for reporting  and keeping records of environmental data, and any conditions and  monitoring requirements for protecting the non-aquatic environment,  proposed for possible inclusion in the license as environmental  conditions in accordance with Sec. 50.36b of this chapter. As stated in  Sec. 51.23, no discussion of the environmental impacts of the continued  storage of spent fuel is required in this report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Early site permit stage. Each applicant for an early site permit  shall submit with its application a separate document, entitled  ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Early Site Permit Stage,'' which  shall contain the information specified in Sec. Sec. 51.45, 51.51, and  51.52, as modified in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The environmental report must include an evaluation of  alternative sites to determine whether there is any obviously superior  alternative to the site proposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The environmental report may address one or more of the  environmental effects of construction and operation of a reactor, or  reactors, which have design characteristics that fall within the site  characteristics and design parameters for the early site permit  application, provided however, that the environmental report must  address all environmental effects of construction and operation  necessary to determine whether there is any obviously superior  alternative to the site proposed. The environmental report need not  include an assessment of the economic, technical, or other benefits (for  example, need for power) and costs of the proposed action or an  evaluation of alternative energy sources. As stated in Sec. 51.23, no  discussion of the environmental impacts of the continued storage of  spent fuel is required in this report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For other than light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors, the  environmental report must contain the basis for evaluating the  contribution of the environmental effects of fuel cycle activities for  the nuclear power reactor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each environmental report must identify the procedures for  reporting and keeping records of environmental data, and any conditions  and monitoring requirements for protecting the non-aquatic environment,  proposed for possible inclusion in the license as environmental  conditions in accordance with Sec. 50.36b of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Combined license stage. Each applicant for a combined license  shall submit with its application a separate document, entitled  ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Combined License Stage.'' Each  environmental report shall contain the information specified in  Sec. Sec. 51.45, 51.51, and 51.52, as modified in this paragraph. For  other than light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors, the environmental  report shall contain the basis for evaluating the contribution of the  environmental effects of fuel cycle activities for the nuclear power  reactor. Each environmental report shall identify procedures for  reporting and keeping records of environmental data, and any conditions  and monitoring requirements for protecting the non-aquatic environment,  proposed for possible inclusion in the license as environmental  conditions in accordance with Sec. 50.36b of this chapter. The combined  license environmental report may reference information contained in a  final environmental document previously prepared by the NRC staff. As  stated in Sec. 51.23, no discussion of the environmental impacts of the  continued storage of spent fuel is required in this report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application referencing an early site permit. If the combined  license application references an early site permit, then the  ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Combined License Stage'' need not  contain information or analyses submitted to the Commission in  ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Early Site Permit Stage,'' or  resolved in the Commission's early site permit environmental impact  statement, but must   contain, in addition to the environmental information and analyses  otherwise required:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information to demonstrate that the design of the facility falls  within the site characteristics and design parameters specified in the  early site permit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information to resolve any significant environmental issue that  was not resolved in the early site permit proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any new and significant information for issues related to the  impacts of construction and operation of the facility that were resolved  in the early site permit proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the process used to identify new and  significant information regarding the NRC's conclusions in the early  site permit environmental impact statement. The process must use a  reasonable methodology for identifying such new and significant  information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A demonstration that all environmental terms and conditions that  have been included in the early site permit will be satisfied by the  date of issuance of the combined license. Any terms or conditions of the  early site permit that could not be met by the time of issuance of the  combined license, must be set forth as terms or conditions of the  combined license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application referencing standard design certification. If the  combined license references a standard design certification, then the  combined license environmental report may incorporate by reference the  environmental assessment previously prepared by the NRC for the  referenced design certification. If the design certification  environmental assessment is referenced, then the combined license  environmental report must contain information to demonstrate that the  site characteristics for the combined license site fall within the site  parameters in the design certification environmental assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application referencing a manufactured reactor. If the combined  license application proposes to use a manufactured reactor, then the  combined license environmental report may incorporate by reference the  environmental assessment previously prepared by the NRC for the  underlying manufacturing license. If the manufacturing license  environmental assessment is referenced, then the combined license  environmental report must contain information to demonstrate that the  site characteristics for the combined license site fall within the site  parameters in the manufacturing license environmental assessment. The  environmental report need not address the environmental impacts  associated with manufacturing the reactor under the manufacturing  license.
