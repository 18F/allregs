                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An FFI agreement will be in effect in accordance with section 1471(b) if an FFI registers with the IRS pursuant to procedures prescribed by the IRS and agrees to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement. The FFI agreement will incorporate the requirements set forth in this section, any modifications set forth in an applicable Model 2 IGA, and any provisions applicable to a reporting Model 1 FFI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Withholding. A participating FFI is required to deduct and withhold tax

with respect to payments made to recalcitrant account holders and nonparticipating FFIs to the extent required under paragraph (b) of this section. A participating FFI that is prohibited by foreign law from withholding as required under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an account must close such account within a reasonable period of time or must otherwise block or transfer such account as described in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification and documentation of account holders. A participating FFI is required to obtain such information regarding each holder of each account maintained by the participating FFI to determine whether each account is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI in accordance with the due diligence procedures for identifying and documenting account holders described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expanded affiliated group. Except as otherwise provided in Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA, in order for any FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group to be a participating FFI, each FFI that is a member of the expanded affiliated group must be a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI as described in paragraph (e) of this section. For a limited period described in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, however, a branch of an FFI or an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group and is unable under foreign law to satisfy the requirements of this section may instead obtain status as a limited branch of a participating FFI or limited FFI if the branch or FFI meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section (as applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Verification. A participating FFI is required to adopt a compliance program as described in paragraph (f) of this section under the authority of the responsible officer, who will be required to certify periodically to the IRS on behalf of the FFI regarding the participating FFI's compliance with the requirements of the FFI agreement. If the IRS identifies concerns about the participating FFI's compliance, the IRS may request additional information to verify compliance with the requirements of the FFI agreement as described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Event of default. A participating FFI is required to cure an event of default with respect to the FFI agreement as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the IRS will deliver to a participating FFI a notice of default and will allow the FFI an opportunity to cure the event of default as described in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Refunds. A participating FFI may file a collective refund on behalf of certain account holders and payees for amounts withheld by the participating FFI or its withholding agent under chapter 4 in excess of the account holder or payee's U.S. tax liability to the extent permitted in paragraph (h) of this section. A participating FFI may also make an adjustment for overwithholding using either the reimbursement procedure described in Sec. 1.1474-2(a)(3) or the set-off procedure described in Sec. 1.1474-2(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Withholding requirements--(1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign passthru payments. A participating FFI is not required to deduct and withhold tax on a foreign passthru payment made by such participating FFI to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or to a nonparticipating FFI before the later of January 1, 2017, or the date of publication in the Federal Register of final regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Withholding on limited FFIs and limited branches--(i) Limited FFIs. A participating FFI is required to withhold on a withholdable payment made to a

limited FFI identifying itself as a nonparticipating FFI. A participating FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more limited FFIs will also be required to treat any such limited FFI as a nonparticipating FFI with respect to withholdable payments made to such limited FFI. A participating FFI will be considered to have made a withholdable payment to a limited FFI if such participating FFI receives a withholdable payment with respect to a security or instrument held on behalf of a limited FFI (or an account maintained by the limited FFI). A participating FFI will also be considered to have made a withholdable payment to a limited FFI when the limited FFI receives a payment with respect to a transaction between the limited FFI and such participating FFI that is in the same expanded affiliated group and such transaction hedges or otherwise provides total return exposure to another transaction between such participating FFI and a third party that gives rise to a withholdable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limited FFIs. A participating FFI is required to withhold on a withholdable payment made to a

limited FFI identifying itself as a nonparticipating FFI. A participating FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more limited FFIs will also be required to treat any such limited FFI as a nonparticipating FFI with respect to withholdable payments made to such limited FFI. A participating FFI will be considered to have made a withholdable payment to a limited FFI if such participating FFI receives a withholdable payment with respect to a security or instrument held on behalf of a limited FFI (or an account maintained by the limited FFI). A participating FFI will also be considered to have made a withholdable payment to a limited FFI when the limited FFI receives a payment with respect to a transaction between the limited FFI and such participating FFI that is in the same expanded affiliated group and such transaction hedges or otherwise provides total return exposure to another transaction between such participating FFI and a third party that gives rise to a withholdable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limited branches. A participating FFI is required to withhold on a withholdable payment made to a limited branch identifying itself as a nonparticipating FFI. A branch of the participating FFI other than the limited branch is also required to withhold on a withholdable payment when it receives the payment on behalf of a limited branch of the participating FFI. A branch of the participating FFI other than a limited branch will be considered to have received a withholdable payment on behalf of a limited branch when such other branch receives a withholdable payment with respect to a security or instrument it holds on behalf of a limited branch (or an account maintained by the limited branch). A branch of a participating FFI other than a limited branch will be considered to hold a security or instrument on behalf of a limited branch when it executes a transaction with a limited branch that hedges or otherwise provides total return exposure to another transaction between such other branch and a third party that gives rise to a withholdable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Withholding requirements for U.S. branches of participating FFIs (and reporting Model 1 FFIs) that are treated as U.S. persons. A U.S. branch of a participating FFI (and reporting Model 1 FFI) that is treated as a U.S. person and that satisfies its backup withholding obligations under section 3406(a) with respect to accounts held at the U.S. branch by account holders that are payees treated as other than exempt recipients under chapter 61 will be treated as satisfying its withholding obligation with respect to such accounts under section 1471(b)(1) and this paragraph (b). See paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for the special reporting requirements applicable to U.S. branches of participating FFIs (and reporting Model 1 FFIs) that are treated as U.S. persons. See paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(4) of this section for the reporting requirements of U.S. branches of participating FFIs (and reporting Model 1 FFIs) with respect to payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Due diligence for the identification and documentation of account holders and payees--(1) Scope of paragraph. Except to the extent that a participating FFI relies on the due diligence procedures set forth in an applicable Model 2 IGA, a participating FFI must follow this paragraph (c) to identify and document the chapter 4 status of each holder of an account maintained by the participating FFI to determine if the account is a U.S. account, non-U.S. account, or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides the general rules for identification and documentation of account holders and payees, and paragraph (c)(2)(v) provides special documentation requirements for certain U.S. branches of participating FFIs. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides the rules for documenting entity accounts and payees. Paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides the general rules for documenting individual accounts other than preexisting accounts. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section provides the identification

and documentation procedure for preexisting individual accounts. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the documentation exceptions for entity accounts and individual accounts. Paragraph (c)(7) of this section outlines the certification requirement relating to the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) with respect to preexisting accounts within the specified periods of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope of paragraph. Except to the extent that a participating FFI relies on the due diligence procedures set forth in an applicable Model 2 IGA, a participating FFI must follow this paragraph (c) to identify and document the chapter 4 status of each holder of an account maintained by the participating FFI to determine if the account is a U.S. account, non-U.S. account, or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides the general rules for identification and documentation of account holders and payees, and paragraph (c)(2)(v) provides special documentation requirements for certain U.S. branches of participating FFIs.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section (documentation exceptions for certain preexisting accounts), a participating FFI is required to identify among accounts maintained by the participating FFI each account that is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI, and to report information about such accounts in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). See Sec. 1.1471-5(a)(3) for rules to determine the holder of an account. The participating FFI is also required to retain a record of the documentation collected or otherwise maintained that meets the requirements described in this paragraph (c) when making certain payments to an account holder or payee (if other than an account holder) to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section or whether reporting applies under Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii)(C) and any payee for which it provides the certification described in Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(9)(iii)(A) to another withholding agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Overview. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section (documentation exceptions for certain preexisting accounts), a participating FFI is required to identify among accounts maintained by the participating FFI each account that is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI, and to report information about such accounts in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). See Sec. 1.1471-5(a)(3) for rules to determine the holder of an account. The participating FFI is also required to retain a record of the documentation collected or otherwise maintained that meets the requirements described in this paragraph (c) when making certain payments to an account holder or payee (if other than an account holder) to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section or whether reporting applies under Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii)(C) and any payee for which it provides the certification described in Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(9)(iii)(A) to another withholding agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Standards of knowledge--(A) In general. A participating FFI may rely on valid documentation that is collected pursuant to the due diligence procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) or that is otherwise maintained in the participating FFI's files, unless the participating FFI knows or has reason to know that such documentation is unreliable or incorrect. For purposes of a participating FFI documenting an account holder under this paragraph (c), the requirements for the validity of withholding certificates, written statements, and documentary evidence provided in Sec. 1.1471-3(c) shall apply regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. Except as otherwise provided paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (certain mergers or bulk acquisitions) and in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section (preexisting individual accounts), to determine whether a participating FFI knows or has reason to know that the documentation collected or otherwise maintained with respect to the account holder is unreliable or incorrect, the standards of knowledge provided in Sec. 1.1471-3(e) shall apply regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account.

A participating FFI that acquires accounts of another financial institution either in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value (other than a related party transaction described in Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(9)(v)) may apply the limitations on reason to know provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(1) or (2) of this section (as applicable and subject to the conditions therein), or the rules of Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(9)(v) to rely upon documentation collected by another financial institution for an account acquired either in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The participating FFI may treat accounts acquired in a transaction described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) as preexisting accounts for purposes of applying the identification and documentation procedures of this paragraph (c) by substituting the date of acquisition of such accounts for the effective date of the FFI agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Participating FFIs and certain deemed-compliant FFIs that apply the due diligence rules, and U.S. financial institutions. If a participating FFI (transferee FFI) acquires accounts of another participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (including a U.S. branch of either such FFI) that applies the due diligence requirements of this paragraph

(c) as a condition of its status (as described in Sec. 1.1471-5(f)), or of a U.S. financial institution (transferor FI), the transferee FFI may rely on the chapter 4 status determination made by the transferor FI for an account holder and will not be subject to the standards of knowledge set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section until there is a change in circumstances with respect to the account if the following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferee FFI does not have actual knowledge that the chapter 4 status determination provided by the transferor FI is unreliable or incorrect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the certification period following the acquisition of such accounts (described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section), the transferee FFI acquiring the accounts tests a sample of the acquired accounts to determine if the chapter 4 status determinations made by the transferor FI are reliable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a transferor FI that is a branch of a participating FFI or of a registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person) or that is a deemed-compliant FFI that applies the requisite due diligence rules of this paragraph (c) as a condition of its status, the transferor FI provides a written representation to the transferee FFI acquiring the accounts that the transferor FI has applied the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) with respect to the transferred accounts and, in the case of a transferor FI that is a participating FFI, has complied with the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transferor FI that is a U.S. financial institution or that is a U.S branch of a participating FFI or of a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is treated as a U.S. person, the transferee FFI may rely on the chapter 4 status determinations for a payee that is an entity only if prior to the date of transfer the U.S. financial institution or U.S. branch made a withholdable payment to the payee or, for a payee that is an individual, only if the U.S. financial institution or U.S. branch made a reportable payment (as defined under section 3406(b)) to the payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Change in circumstances--(A) Obligation to identify a change in circumstances. A participating FFI is required to institute procedures to ensure that any change in circumstances, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, is identified by the participating FFI, including procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances with respect to an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the account holder has a mailing address in the United States when there was no U.S. address previously associated with the account, the participating FFI will be required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and will be required to retain a record of the appropriate documentation from the account holder as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Obligation to identify a change in circumstances. A participating FFI is required to institute procedures to ensure that any change in circumstances, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, is identified by the participating FFI, including procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances with respect to an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the account holder has a mailing address in the United States when there was no U.S. address previously associated with the account, the participating FFI will be required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and will be required to retain a record of the appropriate documentation from the account holder as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of change in circumstances. For purposes of this section, a change in circumstances (as defined in Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)) includes any change or addition of information to the account holder's account (including the addition, substitution, or other change of an account holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such account (applying the account aggregation rules described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) or by treating the accounts as consolidated obligations) if such change or addition of information affects the chapter 4 status of the account holder. For example, if a holder of an account (including a preexisting account) opens another account that is linked to such account in the participating FFI's computerized system as described under Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) and as part of the participating FFI's account opening procedures the account holder provides a U.S. telephone number for such other account, this is a change in circumstances with respect to the first mentioned account. With respect to a preexisting account that meets a documentation exception described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section, a change in circumstances also includes a change in account balance or value as of the end of the first subsequent year that

causes the account no longer to meet the documentation exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Requirements following a change in circumstances. With respect to an individual account or an account held by a passive NFFE for which there is a change in circumstances with respect to the information regarding its owners, following a change in circumstances the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(5)(iv)(B)(2) of this section within the time period provided by Sec. 1.1471-5(g)(3)(iii) or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a recalcitrant account holder. With respect to an account held by an entity other than a passive NFFE described in the preceding sentence, following a change in circumstances, the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the date that is 90 days after the change in circumstances or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a nonparticipating FFI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Record retention. A participating FFI must retain a record of the documentation collected (or otherwise maintained) to establish the chapter 4 status of an account holder or payee pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). A participating FFI will be treated as having retained a record of a withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence if the participating FFI retains either an original, certified copy, or photocopy (including a microfiche, scan, or similar means of record retention) of the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence collected to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder for six calendar years following the year in which the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) were performed for the account. With respect to documentary evidence for an offshore obligation, however, a participating FFI that is not required to retain copies of documentation reviewed pursuant to its AML due diligence will be treated as having retained a record of such documentation if the participating FFI retains a record in its files noting the date the documentation was reviewed, each type of document, the document's identification number (if any) (for example, passport number), and whether any U.S. indicia were identified. The previous sentence applies with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation, except, in such case, the requirement to record whether the documentation contained U.S. indicia does not apply. A participating FFI must also retain a record of any searches, including search results provided by third-party credit agencies as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, results from electronic searches, and requests made and responses to relationship manager inquiries for six calendar years following the year in which the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) were performed for the account. A participating FFI may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such extension prior to the end of the six year retention period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, a participating FFI must retain a record of the chapter 4 status of an account holder or payee for as long as the FFI maintains the account or obligation. See Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(6)(iii)(A) for the record retention period applicable to a participating FFI that is a withholding agent with respect to documentation collected (or otherwise maintained) for a payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for U.S. branches of participating FFIs (and reporting Model 1 FFIs) that are treated as U.S. persons. A U.S. branch of a participating FFI (and reporting Model 1 FFI) that is treated as a U.S. person shall apply, in lieu of the due diligence requirements of this paragraph (c), the due diligence requirements of Sec. 1.1471-3 to determine the chapter 4 status of account holders and payees that are entities and shall apply the documentation requirements of chapter 3 or 61 (as applicable) with respect to individual account holders. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section for special withholding rules and paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for special reporting rules applicable to such U.S. branches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identification and documentation procedure for entity accounts and payees--(i) In general. With respect to accounts held by entities, unless the documentation exception described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section applies, a participating FFI must determine if the account is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI by applying the principles of Sec. 1.1471-3(b), (c), and (d) to establish the chapter 4 status of each account holder and each payee regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. If an account holder receiving a payment is not the payee of the payment under Secs. 1.1471-3(a) and 1.1472-1(d)(3), the participating FFI is also required to establish the chapter 4 status of the payee or payees in order to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. With respect to accounts held by entities, unless the documentation exception described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section applies, a participating FFI must determine if the account is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI by applying the principles of Sec. 1.1471-3(b), (c), and (d) to establish the chapter 4 status of each account holder and each payee regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. If an account holder receiving a payment is not the payee of the payment under Secs. 1.1471-3(a) and 1.1472-1(d)(3), the participating FFI is also required to establish the chapter 4 status of the payee or payees in order to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Timeframe for applying identification and documentation procedure for entity accounts and payees. For preexisting entity accounts, a participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures within six months of the effective date of the FFI agreement for any account holder that is a prima facie FFI, as defined in Sec. 1.1471-2(a)(4)(ii)(B), and within two years of the effective date of the FFI agreement for all other entity accounts, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. For accounts that are not preexisting accounts, the participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures by the earlier of the date a withholdable payment or a foreign passthru payment is made with respect to the account or within 90 days of the date the participating FFI opens the account. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), with respect to a preexisting obligation issued in nonregistered (bearer) form by an investment entity, the investment entity is required to perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures at the time a payment is collected by the beneficial owner of the payment (including a beneficial owner that collects the payment through an intermediary or agent).

A participating FFI is not required to apply the enhanced review of paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(3) and may instead rely on the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section to identify U.S. indicia to the extent the following information is available in the FFI's electronically searchable information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The account holder's nationality and/or residence status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The account holder's current residence address and mailing address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The account holder's current telephone number(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there are standing instructions to pay amounts to another account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whether there is a current ``in-care-of'' address or ``hold mail'' address for the account holder if no other residence or mailing address is found for the account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(c)(5)(iv)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the documentation exceptions provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Aggregation rules applicable to preexisting individual accounts. U, a U.S. resident individual, holds 100 shares of common stock of FFI1, an investment entity. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, the common stock held by U is worth $45,000. U also holds shares of preferred stock of FFI1. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, U's preferred stock in FFI1 is worth $35,000. Neither FFI1's common stock nor FFI1's preferred stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. U also holds debt instruments issued by FFI1 that are not regularly traded on an established securities market. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, U's FFI1 debt instruments are worth $15,000. U's common and preferred equity interests are associated with U and with one another by reference to U's foreign tax identification number in FFI1's computerized information management system. However, U's debt instruments are not associated with U's equity interests in FFI1's computerized information management system. None of these accounts are managed by a relationship manager. Previously, FFI1 was not required to and did not obtain a Form W-9 from U for purposes of chapter 3 or 61. U's FFI1 debt interests are eligible for the paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) documentation exception because that account does not exceed the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, taking into account the aggregation rule described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(2) of this section. However, U's common and preferred equity interests are not eligible for the paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) documentation exception because the accounts exceed the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, taking into account the aggregation rules described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Aggregation rules for owners of entity accounts. In Year 1, U, a U.S. resident individual, maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB, a commercial bank. The balance in U's depository account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $20,000. U also owns 100% of Entity X, which maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB, and 50% of Entity Y, which maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB. The balance in Entity X's account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $130,000, and the balance in Entity Y's account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $110,000. All three accounts are associated with one another in CB's computerized information management system by reference to U's foreign tax identification number. None of the accounts are managed by a relationship manager. Previously, CB was not required to and did not obtain a Form W-9 from U for purposes of chapter 3 or 61. U's depository account qualifies for the Sec. 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) exception to U.S. account status because it does not exceed the $50,000 threshold, taking into account the aggregation rule described in Sec. 1.1471-5(a)(4)(iii)(A). Entity X's account and Entity Y's account both qualify for the paragraph (c)(3)(iii) documentation exception because the accounts do not exceed the $250,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(1) of this section taking into account the aggregation rules described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Certifications of responsible officer. In order for a participating FFI to comply with the requirements of an FFI agreement with respect to its identification procedures for preexisting accounts, a responsible officer of the participating FFI must certify to the IRS regarding the participating FFIs

compliance with the diligence requirements of this paragraph (c). Such certification must be made no later than 60 days following the date that is two years after the effective date of the FFI agreement. The responsible officer must certify that the participating FFI has completed the review of all high-value accounts as required under paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(D) and (E) of this section and treats any account holder of an account for which the participating FFI has not retained a record of any required documentation as a recalcitrant account holder as required under this section and Sec. 1.1471-5(g). The responsible officer must also certify that the participating FFI has completed the account identification procedures and documentation requirements of this paragraph (c) for all other preexisting accounts or, if it has not retained a record of the documentation required under this paragraph (c) with respect to an account, treats such account in accordance with the requirements of this section and Sec. 1.1471-5(g). The responsible officer must also certify that the participating FFI has completed the account identification procedures and documentation requirements of this paragraph (c) for all other preexisting accounts or, if it has not retained a record of the documentation required under this paragraph (c) with respect to an account, treats such account in accordance with the requirements of this section and Sec. 1.1471-5(g) or Sec. 1.1471-3(f) (as applicable). A reasonable inquiry for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7) is a review of the participating FFI's procedures and a written inquiry, such as email requests to relevant lines of business, that requires responses from relevant customer on-boarding and management personnel as to whether they engaged in any such practices during that period. Practices or procedures that assist account holders in the avoidance of chapter 4 include, for example, suggesting that account holders split up accounts to avoid classification as a high-value account; suggesting that account holders of U.S. accounts close, transfer, or withdraw from their account to avoid reporting; intentional failures to disclose a known U.S. account; suggesting that an account holder remove U.S. indicia from its account information; or facilitating the manipulation of account balances or values to avoid thresholds. If the responsible officer is unable to make any of the certifications described in this paragraph (c)(7), the responsible officer must make a qualified certification to the IRS stating that such certification cannot be made and that corrective actions will be taken by the responsible officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Account reporting--(1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting requirements in general--(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Financial institution required to report an account--(A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(2)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4T(d)(2)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special reporting of account holders of territory financial institutions.

For purposes of reporting under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the amount and character of payments made with respect to an account may be determined under the same principles that the participating FFI uses to report information on its resident account holders to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the FFI (or branch thereof) is located. Thus, the amount and character of items of income described in paragraphs (d)(4)(iv)(A), (B), and (C) need not be determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. If any of the types of payments described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section are not reported to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the participating FFI (or branch thereof) is located, such amounts may be determined in the same manner as is used by the participating FFI for purposes of reporting to the account holder. If any of the types of payments described in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) is neither reported to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the FFI (or branch thereof) is located nor reported to the account holder for the year for which reporting is required under paragraph (d) of this section, such item must be determined and reported either in accordance with U.S. federal tax principles or in accordance with any reasonable method of reporting that is consistent with the accounting principles generally applied by the participating FFI. Once a participating FFI (or branch thereof) has applied a method to determine such amounts, it must apply such method consistently for all account holders and for all subsequent years unless the Commissioner consents to a change in such method. Consent will be automatically granted for a change to rely on U.S. federal income tax principles to determine such amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Currency translation. A payment described in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) may be reported in the currency in which the payment is denominated or in U.S. dollars. In the case of payments denominated in one or more foreign currencies, a participating FFI may elect to report the payments in a currency in which payments are denominated and is required to identify the currency in which the account is reported. If such a payment is reported in

U.S. dollars, the participating FFI must calculate the amount in the manner described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Record retention requirements. A participating FFI that produces, in the ordinary course of its business, account statements that summarize the activity (including withdrawals, transfers, and closures) of an account for any calendar year in which the account was required to be reported under paragraph (d)(3) of this section must retain a record of such account statements. The record must be retained for the longer of six years or the retention period under the FFI's normal business procedures. A participating FFI may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such an extension prior to the expiration of the six year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Election to perform chapter 61 reporting--(i) In general--(A) Election under section 1471(c)(2). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5), a participating FFI may elect under section 1471(c)(2) and this paragraph (d)(5) to report under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, and 6049, as appropriate, with respect to any account required to be reported under this paragraph (d). Such reporting must be done as if such participating FFI were a U.S. payor and each holder of an account that is a specified U.S. person, U.S. owned foreign entity, or owner-documented FFI were a payee who is an individual and citizen of the United States. If a participating FFI makes such an election, the FFI is required to report the information required under this paragraph (d)(5) with respect to each such U.S. account or account held by an owner-documented FFI, regardless of whether the account holder of such account qualifies as a recipient exempt from reporting by a payor or middleman under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, or 6049, including the reporting of payments made to such account of amounts that are subject to reporting under any of these sections. A participating FFI that elects to report an account under the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) is required to report the information described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section for a calendar year regardless of whether a reportable payment was made to the U.S. account during the calendar year. A participating FFI that reports an account under the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) is not required to report the information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to the account. The election under section 1471(c)(2) described in this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A) does not apply to cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts that are financial accounts described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iv). See paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section for an election to report cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts that are U.S. accounts held by specified U.S. persons in a manner similar to section 6047(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) Election under section 1471(c)(2). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5), a participating FFI may elect under section 1471(c)(2) and this paragraph (d)(5) to report under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, and 6049, as appropriate, with respect to any account required to be reported under this paragraph (d).

Except as otherwise provided under Sec. 1.1471-2 and, with respect to certain preexisting accounts, under paragraph (c) of this section, a participating FFI is required to determine whether withholding applies at the time a payment is made by reliably associating the payment with valid documentation described in paragraph (c) of this section for the payee of the payment. For a payment made to an account, if the account is held by one or more individuals, the payee is each individual account holder. For a payment made to an account held by an entity, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1471-3(a)(3), the payee is the account holder. If the participating FFI makes a withholdable payment to a payee that is an entity and the payment is made with respect to an obligation that is not an account, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1471-3(a)(3), the payee is the person to whom the payment is made. See Sec. 1.1473-1(a) to determine when a payment is made in the case of a withholdable payment. If a participating FFI cannot reliably associate a payment (or any portion of a payment) with valid documentation, the rules described in paragraph (c) of

this section shall apply to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder (and payee if other than the account holder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating FFI may establish after the date of payment that withholding was not required to the extent permitted under Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(7) or may apply the procedures provided in Sec. 1.1474-2 when overwithholding occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Satisfaction of withholding requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A participating FFI that complies with the withholding obligations of this paragraph (b) with respect to accounts held by recalcitrant account holders and payees that are nonparticipating FFIs shall be deemed to satisfy its withholding obligations under sections 1471(a) and 1472 with respect to such account holders and payees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withholding not required. A participating FFI that is an NQI, NWP, NWT, or that is a QI that elects under section 1471(b)(3) not to assume withholding responsibility for a payment and that provides its withholding agent with the information necessary to allocate all or a portion of the payment to each payee as part of a withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii) will generally not be required to withhold under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. See Sec. 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii), however, for the circumstances under which a participating FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT has a residual withholding responsibility. See also Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(9)(iii)(B) for the circumstances under which a participating FFI that is a broker has a residual withholding responsibility as an intermediary of the payment and may also be liable for any underwithholding that occurs. See Secs. 1.1471-2(a) and 1.1472-1(a)(2)(i) and the QI, WP, or WT agreement for the withholding requirements of a participating FFI that is a QI, WP, or WT for purposes of chapter 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Election to withhold under section 3406. A participating FFI may elect to satisfy its withholding obligation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to recalcitrant account holders that are also U.S. non-exempt recipients subject to backup withholding under section 3406 receiving withholdable payments, to the extent that the payments also constitute reportable payments, by applying withholding under section 3406 at the backup withholding rate to such withholdable payments. A participating FFI may make the election described in this paragraph only if it complies with the information reporting rules under chapter 61 with respect to payments to which backup withholding applies. Nothing in this paragraph relieves a participating FFI of its requirement to backup withhold under section 3406 with respect to reportable payments that are not also withholdable payments. See Sec. 1.1474-6(f) for the general rule that satisfying withholding requirements under chapter 4 will satisfy backup withholding requirements under section 3406 for a payment that is both a withholdable payment and a reportable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> through (5)(ii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(b)(4) through (b)(5)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for dormant accounts. A participating FFI that makes a withholdable payment not otherwise subject to withholding under chapter 3 or backup withholding under section 3406 to a recalcitrant account holder of a dormant account that it maintains must withhold on the account for purposes of chapter 4. However, the participating FFI may, in lieu of depositing the tax withheld, set aside the amount withheld in escrow until the date that the account ceases to be a dormant account. In such case, the tax withheld becomes due 90 days following the date that the account ceases to be a dormant account if the account holder does not provide the documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section or becomes refundable to the account holder if the account holder provides the documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section establishing that withholding does not apply. A participating FFI that maintains a dormant account of a recalcitrant account holder and that elects to escrow withheld tax pursuant to this paragraph (b)(6) may not delegate the responsibility to escrow withheld tax to the withholding agent from which it is receiving payment. Once a dormant

account escheats irrevocably to a foreign government under the relevant laws in the jurisdiction in which the participating FFI (or branch thereof) operates, the participating FFI is no longer required to deposit with the IRS the amount held in escrow with respect to the account. See paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section for the definition of dormant account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (4)(iii)(B) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(1) through (c)(4)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (iii)(C) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (1)(vii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B)(1) through (c)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(vii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (v) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(i) through (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Standing instructions to pay amounts.

A participating FFI that has previously obtained documentation from an account holder to establish the account holder's status as a foreign individual in order to meet its obligations under its QI, WP, or WT agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its reporting obligations as a U.S. payor under chapter 61, is not required to perform the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section or the enhanced review described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(3) of this section for such account. Additionally, a participating FFI with a U.S. payor as its paying agent is not required to perform the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section or the enhanced review described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(3) of this section for an account for which its paying agent that is a U.S. payor has previously obtained documentation to establish the account holder's status as a foreign individual under chapter 61. The participating FFI is required, however, to perform the relationship manager inquiry described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(2) of this section if the account is a high-value account described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(1) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(E), a participating FFI has documented an account holder's foreign status under chapter 61 if the participating FFI (or its paying agent that is a U.S. payor) has retained a record of the documentation required under chapter 61 to establish the foreign status of an individual and the account received a reportable payment as defined under section 3406(b) in any prior year that was properly reported in that year. In the case of a participating FFI that is a QI, WP, or WT, the participating FFI has documented an account holder's foreign status under its QI, WP, or WT agreement (as applicable) if the participating FFI has met the relevant documentation and reporting requirements of its agreement with respect to an account holder that received a reportable amount in any year in which its agreement was in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> through (7) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(6) through (7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope of paragraph.

Paragraph (d)(3) of this section describes the information required to be reported and the manner of reporting by a participating FFI under section 1471(c)(1) with respect to a U.S. account or an account held by an owner-documented FFI. Paragraph (d)(4) of this section provides definitions of terms applicable to paragraph (d)(3). Paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes the conditions for a participating FFI to elect to report its U.S. accounts and accounts held by owner-documented FFIs under section 1471(c)(2) and the information required to be reported under such election. Paragraph (d)(6) of this section provides rules for a participating FFI to report its recalcitrant account holders.

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(1) or paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, each FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group must have the chapter 4 status of a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner as a condition for any member of such group to obtain the status of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in published guidance, each FFI other than a certified deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner in an expanded affiliated group must submit a registration form to the IRS in such manner as the IRS may prescribe requesting an FFI agreement, registered deemed-compliant status, or limited FFI status as a condition for any member to become a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each FFI other than a certified deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner that is a member of such group must also agree to all of the requirements for the status for which it applies with respect to all accounts maintained at all of its branches, offices, and divisions. For the withholding requirements of a participating FFI with respect to its limited branches and its affiliates that are limited FFIs, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an FFI (or branch thereof) that is treated as a participating FFI or a deemed-compliant FFI pursuant to a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA will maintain such status provided that it meets the terms for such status pursuant to such agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> through (C) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(e)(2)(i)(A) through (C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Branch defined. For purposes of this section, a branch is a unit, business, or office of an FFI that is treated as a branch under the regulatory regime of a country or that is otherwise regulated under the laws of a country as separate from other offices, units, or branches of the FFI and also includes an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from an FFI (including

branches maintained by such disregarded entity). For purposes of this section, a branch includes a unit, business, or office of an FFI located in a country in which it is resident, and a unit, business, or office of an FFI located in the country in which the FFI is created or organized. All units, businesses, and offices of a participating FFI located in a single country, and all entities disregarded as entities separate from a participating FFI and located in a single country, shall be treated as a single branch and may use the same GIIN. An account will be treated as maintained by a branch or disregarded entity if the rights and obligations of the account holder and the participating FFI with regard to such account (including any assets held in the account) are governed by the laws of the country of the branch or disregarded entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> through (v) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(e)(2)(iii) through (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> through (4) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(e)(3) through (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (3)(iv)(C) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(f)(1) through (f)(3)(iv)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General inquiries.

The IRS may request, for example, a description or copy of the participating FFI's policies and procedures for fulfilling the requirements of the FFI agreement, a description of the participating FFI's procedures for conducting its periodic review, or a copy of any written reports documenting the findings of such review in order to evaluate the sufficiency of the participating FFI's compliance program and review of such program. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the facts and circumstances surrounding the FFI's potential failure to comply with the FFI agreement. The IRS may make these requests to a sponsoring entity with respect to any sponsored FFI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Defined.

The participating FFI must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the participating FFI does not agree that an event of default has occurred. Taking into account the terms of any applicable Model 2 IGA, if the participating FFI does not provide a response within the specified time period, the IRS may, at its sole discretion, deliver a notice of termination that terminates the FFI's participating FFI status. A participating FFI may request, within a reasonable period of time, reconsideration of a notice of default or notice of termination by written request to the Deputy Commissioner (International), LB&I.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> through (j) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1471-4(h) through (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Expiration date.
