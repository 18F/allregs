Intermediate credit institutions (``ICIs'') shall be subject to either the procedures applicable to foreign government entities or those applicable to non-governmental entities, depending on the nature of the specific entity. The Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs or the Assistant Secretary's designee, in consultation with the agency proposing the assistance and other appropriate bureaus and agencies, shall determine (consistent with the definition of ``foreign state'' set forth in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. 1603(a) and made applicable by Sec. 140.5) whether the ICI will be treated as a non-governmental entity or a foreign government entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refunds. In addition to measures required as a consequence of an ICI's treatment as a non-governmental entity or a foreign government entity, a clause shall be included in agreements with all ICIs requiring that any loan greater than $1,000 provided by the ICI to an individual or entity subsequently found to have been convicted of a narcotics offense or engaged in drug trafficking, as defined in this part, shall be subject to refund or recall.</p>
