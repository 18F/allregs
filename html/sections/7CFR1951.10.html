                                Sec. 1951.10  Application of payments on production type loan accounts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Employees receiving payments on OL, EO, SW codes ``24,'' EM for  subtitle B purposes, EE operating-type, and other production-type loan  accounts will select, in accordance with the provisions of this section,  the account(s) to which such payment will be applied. All payments on OL  and EM loans approved on or before December 31, 1971, will be credited  first to any administrative costs, then to noncapitalized interest, then  to the amount of accrued deferred interest, and then to principal. All  payments on all other loans including OL and EM loans approved after  December 31, 1971, will be credited first to any administrative costs,  then to noncapitalized interest, then to the amount of accrued deferred  interest, then to interest accrued to the date of the payment and then  to principal, in accordance with the terms of the note. This section  only applies after the County Supervisor determines the amount of  proceeds that will be released for other purposes in accordance with the  annual plan (Form FmHA or   its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 431-2) and Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1962-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rules for selection of accounts. The following rules will govern  the selection of accounts and installments to which payments will be  applied. As used in this section, ``recoverable costs'' are those which  the loan agreement documents say the borrower is primarily responsible  for paying and which the government can charge to the borrower's  account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payments from farm income or from assignments of income will be  applied first to accounts with small balances, including recoverable  costs, to remove such accounts from the records. Any balance will be  applied on debts secured by the lien in the following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To amounts due or falling due on loans made in connection with  the current year's operations, except:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When funds loaned for the purchase of capital goods were used to  meet the current year's operating expenses, payments will be applied  first to the final unpaid installments to the extent of the loan funds  so used. These payments will be treated as extra payments.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When installments on loans previously made fall due before the  installment on the loan for the current year's operations or when such  loans are delinquent and it is anticipated that sufficient income will  be received to meet the installment on the current year's operations  when due, collections may be applied first to installments on loans made  in previous years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To accounts having the oldest delinquencies, or if no  delinquencies, to the oldest unpaid account, except that the amount  available for payment on OL and EM loan accounts will be prorated  between the two accounts on the basis of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The delinquent amount owed on each, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The total amount owed on each if there are no delinquencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-farm income and payments derived from the sale of real  estate security, will be applied to the earliest account secured by the  earliest lien covering such security. The amount to be applied to  principal will be applied to the final unpaid installment(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On partial refunds of loan advances, the amount to be applied to  the principal will be applied to the final unpaid installment on the  note which evidences such advance; however, a refund of an advance for  current farm and home expenses repayable within the year may be applied  to the principal on the first unpaid installment on such note as a  regular payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total refunds of loan advances will be applied to the notes  which evidence such advances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In applying payments from sources other than those in paragraphs  (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section the borrower has the right to  select the loan account or accounts on which such payments will be  applied. In the absence of the borrower's selection, such payments  generally will be applied in the following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To accounts with small balances, including recoverable costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To accounts with the oldest unsecured note(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To accounts with the oldest delinquencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To accounts with the oldest secured note or notes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> of this section when it is  necessary to apply a part of a payment to delinquent accounts to prevent  the Federal Statute of Limitations from being asserted as a defense in  suits on FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payments in full. Errors of a significant amount in computation  or collection will be called to the attention of the collection official  by the Finance Office. The borrower's note will not be returned until  the balance on the loan account is paid in full. Claims by or on behalf  of the borrowers that the amounts owed have been computed incorrectly  will be referred to the Finance Office.
