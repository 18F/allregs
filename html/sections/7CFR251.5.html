                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for determining eligibility of organizations. Prior to  making commodities or administrative funds available, State agencies, or  eligible recipient agencies to which the State agency has delegated  responsibility for the distribution of TEFAP commodities or  administrative funds, must ensure that an organization applying for  participation in the program meets the definition of an ``eligible  recipient agency'' under Sec. 251.3(d). In addition, applicant  organizations must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies distributing to households. Organizations distributing  commodities to households for home consumption must limit the  distribution of commodities provided under this part to those households  which meet the eligibility criteria established by the State agency in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies providing prepared meals. Organizations providing  prepared meals must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the State  agency, or eligible recipient agency to which they have applied for the  receipt of commodities or administrative funds, that they serve  predominantly needy persons. State agencies may establish a higher  standard than ``predominantly'' and may determine whether organizations  meet the applicable standard by considering socioeconomic data of the  area in which the organization is located, or from which it draws its  clientele. State agencies may not, however, require organizations to  employ a means test to determine that recipients are needy, or to keep  records solely for the purpose of demonstrating that its recipients are  needy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax-exempt status. Private organizations must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be currently operating another Federal program requiring tax- exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Possess documentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  recognizing tax-exempt status under the IRC, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If not in possession of such documentation, be automatically  tax exempt as ``organized or operated exclusively for religious  purposes'' under the IRC, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If not in possession of such documentation, but required to  file an application under the IRC to obtain tax-exempt status, have made  application for recognition of such status and be moving toward  compliance with the requirements for recognition of tax-exempt status.  If the IRS denies a participating organization's application for  recognition of tax-exempt status, the organization must immediately  notify the State agency or the eligible recipient agency, whichever is  appropriate, of such denial, and that agency will terminate the  organization's agreement and participation immediately upon receipt of  such notification. If documentation of IRS recognition of tax-exempt  status has not been obtained and forwarded to the appropriate agency  within 180 days of the effective date of the organization's approval for  participation in TEFAP, the State agency or eligible recipient agency  must terminate the organization's participation until such time as  recognition of tax-exempt status is actually obtained, except that the  State agency or eligible recipient agency may grant a single extension  not to exceed 90 days if the organization can demonstrate, to the State  agency's or eligible recipient agency's satisfaction, that its inability  to obtain tax-exempt status within the 180 day period is due to  circumstances beyond its control. It is the responsibility of the  organization to document that it has complied with all IRS requirements  and has provided all information requested by IRS in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for determining recipient eligibility. Each State  agency must establish uniform Statewide criteria for determining the  eligibility of households to receive commodities provided under this  part for home consumption. The criteria must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enable the State agency to ensure that only households which are  in need of food assistance because of inadequate household income  receive TEFAP commodities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include income-based standards and the methods by which  households may demonstrate eligibility under such standards; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include a requirement that the household reside in the  geographic location served by the State agency at the time of applying  for assistance, but length of residency shall not be used as an  eligibility criterion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delegation of authority. A State agency may delegate to one or  more eligible recipient agencies with which the State agency enters into  an agreement the responsibility for the distribution of commodities and  administrative funds made available under this part. State agencies may  also delegate the authority for selecting eligible recipient agencies  and for determining the eligibility of such organizations to receive  commodities and administrative funds. However, responsibility for  establishing eligibility criteria for organizations in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section, and for establishing recipient  eligibility criteria in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section,  may not be delegated. In instances in which State agencies delegate  authority to eligible recipient agencies to determine the eligibility of  organizations to receive commodities and administrative funds,  eligibility must be determined in accordance with the provisions  contained in this part and the State plan. State agencies will remain  responsible for ensuring that commodities and administrative funds are  distributed in accordance with the provisions contained in this part.
