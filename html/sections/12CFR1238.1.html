This part is issued by the Federal Housing Finance  Agency (FHFA) under section 165(i) of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) (Pub. L. 111- 203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1423-32 (2010), 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)), the Federal  Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as  amended (12 U.S.C. 4513, 4526, 4612), and the Federal Home Loan Bank  Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1426).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This part implements section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd- Frank Act, which requires all large financial companies that have total  consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, and are regulated by a  primary federal financial regulatory agency, to conduct annual stress  tests. To ensure the safety and soundness of the regulated entities, the  Director reserves and retains the discretion to apply this part to any  regulated entity with less than $10 billion total consolidated assets in  a particular year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This part establishes requirements that apply to each regulated  entity's performance of annual stress tests. The purpose of the annual  stress test is to provide the regulated entities, FHFA, and the FRB with  additional, forward-looking information that will help them to assess  capital adequacy at the regulated entities under various scenarios; to  review the regulated entities' stress test results; and to increase  public disclosure of the regulated entities' capital condition by  requiring broad dissemination of the stress test scenarios and results.</p>
