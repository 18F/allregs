Each such Form 2-FR or such other information must be furnished within the time specified in the written notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The reports provided for in this section will be considered filed when received by the regional office of the Commission with jurisdiction over the state wherein the principal place of business of the leverage transaction merchant is located, in accordance with Sec. 140.2 of this chapter, and by the designated self-regulatory organization, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each Form 2-FR filed pursuant to this section which is not required to be certified by an independent public accountant must be completed in accordance with the instructions to the form and contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of financial condition as of the date for which the report is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of changes in ownership equity for the period between the date of the most recent statement of financial condition filed with the Commission and the date for which the report is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of changes in liabilities subordinated to claims of general creditors for the period between the date of the most recent statement of financial condition filed with the Commission and the date for which the report is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to Sec. 31.9, a schedule of coverage requirements and coverage provided, and a schedule of segregation requirements and funds on deposit in segregation, as of the date for which the report is made; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition to the information expressly required, such further information as may be necessary to make the required statements and schedules not misleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each Form 2-FR filed pursuant to this Sec. 31.13 which is required to be certified by an independent public accountant must be completed in accordance with the instructions to the form and contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of financial condition as of the date for which the report is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statements of: income (loss); cash flows; changes in ownership equity; and changes in liabilities subordinated to claims of general creditors, for the period between the date of the most recent statement of financial condition filed with the Commission and the date for which the report is made: Provided, however, That for an applicant filing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the period must be the year ending as of the date of the statement of financial condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to Sec. 31.9, a schedule of coverage requirements and coverage provided, and a schedule of segregation requirements and funds on deposit in segregation, as of the date for which the report is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appropriate footnote disclosures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition to the information expressly required, such further information as may be necessary to make the required statements and schedules not misleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The statements required by paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section may be presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the certified reports filed as of the close of the registrant's fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or accompanying the application for registration pursuant to paragraph

(a) of this section, rather than in the format specifically prescribed by these regulations: Provided, however, That the statement of financial condition is presented in a format as consistent as possible with the Form 2-FR and a reconciliation is provided reconciling such statement of financial condition to the statement of the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to Sec. 31.9.

If the leverage transaction merchant is a sole proprietorship, then the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; or, if a corporation, by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Any leverage transaction merchant wishing to establish a fiscal year other than the calendar year may do so by notifying the National Futures Association of its election of such fiscal year in writing, concurrently with the filing of Form 2-FR pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but in no event may such fiscal year end more than one year from the date of the Form 2-FR filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. A leverage transaction merchant which does not so notify the National Futures Association will be deemed to have elected the calendar year as its fiscal year. A leverage transaction merchant must continue to use its elected fiscal year, calendar or otherwise, unless a change in such fiscal year is approved upon written application to the designated self-regulatory organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In the event any leverage transaction merchant finds that it cannot file its report for any period within the time specified in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the designated self-regulatory organization an application for an extension of time to a specified date which may not be more than 90 days after the date as of which the financial report was to have been filed. The application must state the reasons for the requested extension and must contain an agreement to file the report on or before the specified date. The application must be received by the designated self-regulatory organization before the time specified in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section for filing the report. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the application for an extension of time, the designated self-regulatory organization shall: (1) Notify the leverage transaction merchant of the grant or denial of the requested extension; or (2) indicate that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)(1)</em> In the event a leverage transaction merchant finds that it cannot file its certified financial report and schedules for any year within the time specified in paragraph (b) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the designated self-regulatory organization an application for an extension of time to a specified date not more than 90 days after the date as of which the certified financial report and schedules were to have been filed.

The other financial statements (including the statement of income (loss)), footnote disclosures and schedules of Form 2-FR, trade secrets and certain other commercial or financial information on such other statements and schedules, will be treated as nonpublic for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act and parts 145 and 147 of this chapter.

The independent public accountant's opinion filed pursuant to this section will be deemed to be public information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)(1)</em> Until such time as the Commission orders, otherwise, the Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or his designee the authority to perform all functions reserved to the Commission in this section.
