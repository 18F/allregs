                            <p class="depth0">Each carrier shall maintain at its operating company headquarters a  master index of records. The master index shall identify the records  retained, the related retention period, and the locations where the  records are maintained. The master index shall be subject to review by  Commission staff and the Commission shall reserve the right to add  records, or lengthen retention periods upon finding that retention  periods may be insufficient for its regulatory purposes. When any  records are lost or destroyed before expiration of the retention period  set forth in the master index, a certified statement shall be added to  the master index, as soon as practicable, listing, as far as may be  determined, the records lost or destroyed and describing the  circumstances of the premature loss or destruction. At each office of  the carrier where records are kept or stored, the carrier shall arrange,  file, and currently index the records on site so that   they may be readily identified and made available to representatives of  the Commission.</p>
