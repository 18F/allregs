                            <p class="depth0">A miscellaneous unit that is a disposal unit must be maintained in a manner that complies with Sec. 264.601 during the post-closure care period. In addition, if a treatment or storage unit has contaminated soils or ground water that cannot be completely removed or decontaminated during closure, then that unit must also meet the requirements of Sec. 264.601 during post-closure care. The post-closure plan under Sec. 264.118 must specify the procedures that will be used to satisfy this requirement.
