Knowingly  making a false statement on a credit application is a crime</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The creditor has not determined, pursuant to the optional  verification procedures in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, that  any such applicant is a covered borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The creditor may, but is not required to, verify the status of  an applicant as a covered borrower by requesting the applicant to  provide a current (previous month) military leave and earning statement,  or a military identification card (DD Form 2 for members, DD Form 1173  for dependents), as described in DoD Instruction 1003.1, Identification  (ID) Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Dependents, and  Other Eligible Individuals, December 5, 1997. Upon such request,  activated members of the National Guard or Reserves shall also provide a  copy of the military orders calling the covered member to military  service and any orders further extending military service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The creditor may, but is not required to, verify the status of  an applicant as a covered borrower by accessing the information  available at http://www.dmdc.osd.mil/mla/owa/home.
