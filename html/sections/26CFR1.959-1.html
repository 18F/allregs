                                Sec. 1.959-1  Exclusion from gross income of United States persons
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, to United  States shareholders or to such shareholders' successors in interest. The  exclusion also applies to amounts taxed to United States shareholders as  income of one controlled foreign corporation and later distributed to  another controlled foreign corporation in such a chain of ownership  where such amounts would otherwise be again included in the income of  such shareholders or their successors in interest as subpart F income of  the controlled foreign corporation to which they are   distributed. Section 959 also provides rules for the allocation of  distributions to earnings and profits and for the non-dividend treatment  of actual distributions which are excluded from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Actual distributions to United States persons. The earnings and  profits for a taxable year of a foreign corporation attributable to  amounts which are, or have been, included in the gross income of a  United States shareholder of such corporation under section 951(a) shall  not, when such amounts are distributed to such shareholder directly, or  indirectly through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a), be  again included in the gross income of such United States shareholder.  See section 959(a)(1). Thus, earnings and profits attributable to  amounts which are, or have been, included in the gross income of a  United States shareholder of a foreign corporation under section 951  (a)(1)(A)(i) as subpart F income, under section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii) as  previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less  developed countries, under section 951(a)(1)(A)(iii) as previously  excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in foreign base  company shipping operations, or under section 951(a)(1)(B) as earnings  invested in United States property, shall not be again included in the  gross income of such shareholder when such amounts are actually  distributed, directly or indirectly, to such shareholder. See paragraph  (d) of this section for exclusion applicable to such shareholder's  successor in interest. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A, a United States shareholder, owns 100 percent of the  only class of stock of R Corporation, a corporation organized on January  1, 1963, which is a controlled foreign corporation throughout the period  here involved. Both A and R Corporation use the calendar year as a  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During 1964, R Corporation derives $100 of subpart F income, and  A includes such amount in his gross income under section  951(a)(1)(A)(i). Corporation R's current and accumulated earnings and  profits (before taking into account distributions made during 1964) are  $150. Also, during 1964, R Corporation distributes $50 to A. The $50  distribution is excludable from A's gross income for 1964 under this  paragraph and Sec. 1.959-3 because such distribution represents earnings  and profits attributable to amounts which are included in A's gross  income for such year under section 951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If instead of deriving the $100 of subpart F income in 1964, R  Corporation derives such amount during 1963 and has earnings and profits  for 1963 in excess of $100, A must include $100 in his gross income for  1963 under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). However, the $50 distribution made  by R Corporation to A during 1964 is excludable from A's gross income  for such year under this paragraph and Sec. 1.959-3 because such  distribution represents earnings and profits attributable to amounts  which have been included in A's gross income for 1963 under section  951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, with respect to 1964--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Instead of owning the stock of R Corporation directly, A owns  such stock through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a),  that is, A owns 100 percent of M Corporation which owns 100 percent of N  Corporation which owns 100 percent of R Corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Both M and N Corporations use the calendar year as a taxable  year and are controlled foreign corporations throughout the period here  involved,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corporation R derives $100 of subpart F income and has earnings  and profits in excess of $100,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Neither M Corporation nor N Corporation has earnings and profits  or a deficit in earnings and profits, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The $50 distribution is from R Corporation to N Corporation to M  Corporation to A,  A must include $100 in his gross income for 1964 under section  951(a)(1)(A)(i) by reason of his indirect ownership of R Corporation.  However, the $50 distribution is excludable from A's gross income for  1964 under this paragraph and Sec. 1.959-3 because such distribution  represents earnings and profits attributable to amounts which are  included in A's gross income for such year under section 951(a) and are  distributed indirectly to A through a chain of ownership described in  section 958(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excludable investment of earnings in United States property. The  earnings and profits for a taxable year of a foreign corporation  attributable to amounts which are, or have been, included in the gross  income of a United States shareholder of such corporation under section  951(a)(1)(A) shall not, when such amounts would, but for section  959(a)(2) and this paragraph, be included under section 951(a)(1)(B) in  the gross income of such shareholder directly, or indirectly through a  chain of ownership described in section 958(a), be again included in the  gross income   of such United States shareholder. Thus, earnings and profits  attributable to amounts which are, or have been, included in the gross  income of a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation under  section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) as subpart F income, under section  951(a)(1)(A)(ii) as previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from  investment in less developed countries, or under section  951(a)(1)(A)(iii) as previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from  investment in foreign base company shipping operations, may be invested  in United States property without being again included in such  shareholder's income under section 951 (a). Moreover, the first amount  deemed invested in United States property are amounts previously  included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under  section 951(a)(1)(A). See paragraph (d) of this section for exclusion  applicable to such shareholder's successor in interest. The application  of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A, a United States shareholder, owns 100 percent of the  only class of stock of R Corporation, a corporation organized on January  1, 1963, which is a controlled foreign corporation throughout the period  here involved. Both A and R Corporation use the calendar year as a  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2))</em> located in  the United States. Corporation R makes no distributions during the year,  and its current earnings and profits are in excess of $50. Of the $50  investment of earnings in United States property, $35 is excludable from  A's gross income for 1964 under section 959(a)(2) because such amount  represents earnings and profits which are attributable to amounts which  are included in A's gross income for such year under section  951(a)(1)(A)(i) and therefore may be invested in United States property  without again being included in A's gross income. The remaining $15 is  includible in A's gross income for 1964 under section 951(a)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If, instead of deriving $35 of subpart F income in 1964, R  Corporation has no subpart F income for 1964 but derives the $35 of  subpart F income during 1963 and has earnings and profits for such year  in excess of $35, A must include $35 in his gross income for 1963 under  section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). However, of the $50 investment of earnings in  United States property made by R Corporation during 1964, $35 is  excludable from A's gross income for 1964 under section 959(a)(2)  because such amount represents earnings and profits attributable to  amounts which have been included in A's gross income for 1963 under  section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). The remaining $15 is includible in A's gross  income for 1964 under section 951(a)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application of exclusions to shareholder's successor in  interest. If a United States person (as defined in Sec. 1.957-4)  acquires from any person any portion of the interest in the foreign  corporation of a United States shareholder referred to in paragraph (b)  or (c) of this section, the rules of such paragraph shall apply to such  acquiring person but only to the extent that the acquiring person  establishes to the satisfaction of the district director his right to  the exclusion provided by such paragraph. The information to be  furnished by the acquiring person to the district director with his  return for the taxable year to support such exclusion shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and taxable year of the foreign corporation  from which the distribution is received and of all other corporations,  partnerships, trusts, or estates in any applicable chain of ownership  described in section 958(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, and (in the case of information required to  be furnished after June 20, 1983) taxpayer identification number of the  person from whom the stock interest was acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of the stock interest acquired and its relation,  if any, to a chain of ownership described in section 958(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The amount for which an exclusion under section 959(a) is  claimed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Evidence showing that the earnings and profits for which an  exclusion is claimed are attributable to amounts which were included in  the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a),  that such amounts were not previously excluded from the gross income of  a United States person, and the identity of the United States  shareholder including such amounts.  The acquiring person shall also furnish to the district director such  other information as may be required by the   district director in support of the exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A, a United States shareholder, owns 100 percent of the  only class of stock of R Corporation, a corporation organized on January  1, 1964, and a controlled foreign corporation throughout the period here  involved. Both A and R Corporation use the calendar year as a taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During 1964, R Corporation has $100 of subpart F income and  earnings and profits in excess of $100. A includes $100 in his gross  income for 1964 under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i). During 1965, A sells 40  percent of his stock in R Corporation to B, a United States person who  uses the calendar year as a taxable year. In 1965, R Corporation has no  earnings and profits and experiences no increase in earnings invested in  United States property. Corporation R distributes $40 to B on December  1, 1965. If B establishes his right to the exclusion to the satisfaction  of the district director, he may exclude $40 from his gross income for  1965 under section 959(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If, instead of selling his 40-percent interest directly to B, A  sells on February 1, 1965, 40 percent of his stock in R Corporation to  C, a nonresident alien, and on October 1, 1965, B acquires the 40- percent interest in R Corporation from C, the result is the same as in  paragraph (b) of this example, if B establishes his right to the  exclusion to the satisfaction of the district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, instead of acquiring 40 percent, B acquires only 5 percent  of A's stock in R Corporation and R Corporation distributes $5 to B  during 1965, B is not a United States shareholder (within the meaning of  section 951(b)) with respect to R Corporation since he owns only 5  percent of the stock of R Corporation. Notwithstanding, B may exclude  the $5 distribution from his gross income for 1965 under section  959(a)(1) if he establishes his right to the exclusion to the  satisfaction of the district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the facts are assumed to be the same as in paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this example except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A owns the stock of R Corporation indirectly through a chain of  ownership described in section 958(a), that is, A owns 100 percent of M  Corporation which owns 100 percent of N Corporation which owns 100  percent of R Corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> B acquires from N Corporation 40 percent of the stock in R  Corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Both M Corporation and N Corporation are controlled foreign  corporations which use the calendar year as a taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Neither M Corporation nor N Corporation has any amount in 1964  or 1965 which is includible in gross income of United States  shareholders under section 951(a), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Neither M Corporation nor N Corporation has a deficit in  earnings and profits for 1964;  the result is the same as in paragraph (b) of this example if B  establishes his right to the exclusion to the satisfaction of the  district director.
