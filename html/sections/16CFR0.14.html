The administrative law judges also serve as presiding officers assigned to conduct rulemaking proceedings under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act as amended and other rulemaking proceedings as directed. The Chief Administrative Law Judge also serves as the Chief Presiding Officer. Administrative law judges are appointed under the authority and subject to the prior approval of the Office of Personnel Management.
