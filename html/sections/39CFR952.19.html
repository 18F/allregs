To the extent that the courts of the United States may assert jurisdiction over such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Service on business persons.

Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punishable as contempt.</p>
