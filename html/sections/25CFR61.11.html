                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director or Superintendent shall consider each application,  all documentation, and when applicable, tribal recommendations or  determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director or Superintendent, when tribal recommendations or  determinations are applicable, shall accept the recommendations or  determinations of the Tribal Committee unless clearly erroneous.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Director or Superintendent does not accept the tribal  recommendation or determination, the Tribal Committee shall be notified  in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal  delivery, of the action and the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Tribal Committee may appeal the decision of the Director or  Superintendent not to accept the tribal recommendation or determination.  Such appeal must be in writing and must be filed pursuant to part 62 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise specified by law or in a tribal governing  document, the   determination of the Director or Superintendent shall only affect the  individual's eligibility to share in the distribution of judgment funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director or Superintendent, upon determining an individual's  eligibility, shall notify the individual, parent or guardian having  legal custody of a minor, or sponsor, as applicable, in writing of the  decision. If an individual files applications on behalf of more than one  person, one notice of eligibility or adverse action may be addressed to  the person who filed the applications. However, the notice must list the  name of each person involved. Where an individual is represented by a  sponsor, notification of the sponsor of eligibility or adverse action  shall be considered to be notification of the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Director or Superintendent determines that the individual  is eligible, the name of the individual shall be placed on the roll.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Director or Superintendent determines that the individual  is not eligible, he/she shall notify the individual's parent or guardian  having legal custody of a minor, or sponsor, as applicable, in writing  by certified mail, to be received by the addressee only, return receipt  requested, and shall explain fully the reasons for the adverse action  and the right to appeal to the Secretary.

If a certified or  registered notice is returned as ``Unclaimed'' the Director or  Superintendent shall remail the notice by regular mail together with an  acknowledgment of receipt form to be completed by the addressee and  returned to the Director or Superintendent. If the acknowledgment of  receipt is not returned, computation of the appeal period shall begin on  the date the notice was remailed. Certified or registered notices  returned for any reason other than ``Unclaimed'' need not be remailed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a notice  of adverse action is considered to have been made and computation of the  appeal period shall begin on the earliest of the following dates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of delivery indicated on the return receipt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Of acknowledgment of receipt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Of personal delivery; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Of the return by the post office of an undelivered certified or  registered letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In all cases where an applicant is represented by an attorney,  the attorney shall be recognized as fully controlling the application on  behalf of the applicant and service on the attorney of any document  relating to the application shall be considered to be service on the  applicant. Where an applicant is represented by more than one attorney,  service upon one of the attorneys shall be sufficient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To avoid hardship or gross injustice, the Director or  Superintendent may waive technical deficiencies in applications or other  submissions. Failure to file by the deadline does not constitute a  technical deficiency.</p>
