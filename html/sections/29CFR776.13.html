                            <p class="depth0">Under the Act, as amended, an employee engaged in ``trade commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication'' between any State and any place outside thereof is covered by the Act regardless of whether the ``place outside'' is another State or is a foreign country or is some other place. Before the amendment to section 3(b) which became effective January 25, 1950, employees whose work related solely to the flow of commerce into a State from places outside it which were not ``States'' as defined in the Act were not employees engaged in ``commerce'' for purposes of the Act, although employees whose work was concerned with the flow of commerce out of the State to such places were so engaged. \49\ This placed employees of importers in a less favorable position under the Act than the employees of exporters. This inequality was removed by the amendment to section 3(b). \50\ Accordingly, employees performing work in connection with the importation of goods from foreign countries are engaged ``in commerce'' and covered by the Act, as amended. The coverage of such employees, as of those performing work in connection with the exportation of goods to foreign countries, is determined by the same principles as in the case of employees whose work is connected with goods procured from or sent to other States.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\49\ The definition of ``commerce'' previously referred to commerce ``from any State to any place outside thereof.'' The amendment substituted ``between'' for ``from'' and ``and'' for ``to'' in this clause.</p><p class="depth0">\50\ H. Mgrs. St., 1949, pp. 13, 14.
