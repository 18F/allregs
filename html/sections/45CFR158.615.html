The issuer has no right to appeal a penalty with respect to  which it has not requested a hearing in accordance with Sec. 150.405 of  this subchapter, unless the responsible entity can show good cause, as  determined at Sec. 150.405(b) of this subchapter, for failing to timely  exercise its right to a hearing.</p>
