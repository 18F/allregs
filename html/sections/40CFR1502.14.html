Based on the information and analysis presented in the sections on the Affected Environment (Sec.  1502.15) and the Environmental Consequences (Sec.  1502.16), it should present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decisionmaker and the public. In this section agencies shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Include the alternative of no action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identify the agency's preferred alternative or alternatives, if one or more exists, in the draft statement and identify such alternative in the final statement unless another law prohibits the expression of such a preference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.</p>
