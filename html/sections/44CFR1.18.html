                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any interested person may petition the Administrator for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. For purposes of this section the term person includes a Federal, State or local government or government agency. Each petition shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be submitted to the Rules Docket Clerk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set forth the substance of the rule or amendment proposed or specify the rule sought to be repealed or amended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Explain the interest of the petitioner in support of the action sought; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Set forth all data and arguments available to the petitioner in support of the action sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No public procedures will be held directly on the petition before its disposition. If the Administrator finds that the petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated or a final rule will be issued as appropriate. If the Administrator finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Administrator may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.</p>
