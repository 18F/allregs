                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In lieu of requiring monitoring for TTO, the permitting  authority (or, in the case of indirect dischargers, the control  authority) may allow dischargers to make the following certification  statement: ``Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly  responsible for managing compliance with the permit limitation [or  pretreatment standard] for total toxic organics (TTO), I certify that,  to the best of my knowledge and belief, no dumping of concentrated toxic  organics into the wastewaters has occurred since filing of the last  discharge monitoring report. I further certify that this facility is  implementing the toxic organic management plan submitted to the  permitting [or control] authority.'' For direct dischargers, this  statement is to be included as a ``comment'' on the Discharge Monitoring  Report required by 40 CFR 122.44(i), formerly 40 CFR 122.62(i). For  indirect dischargers, the statement is to be included as a comment to  the periodic reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e). If monitoring is  necessary to measure compliance with the TTO standard, the industrial  discharger need analyse for only those pollutants which would reasonably  be expected to be present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In requesting the certification alternative, a discharger shall  submit a solvent management plan that specifies to the satisfaction of  the permitting authority (or, in the case of indirect dischargers, the  control authority) the toxic organic compounds used; the method of  disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling,  or incineration; and procedures for ensuring that toxic organics do not  routinely spill or leak into the wastewater. For direct dischargers, the  permitting authority shall incorporate the plan as a provision of the  permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Self-monitoring for cyanide must be conducted after cyanide  treatment and before dilution with other streams. Alternatively, samples  may be taken of the final effluent, if the plant limitations are  adjusted based on the dilution ratio of the cyanide waste stream flow to  the effluent flow.
