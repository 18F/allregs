section and the name of the packing medium specified in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, preceded by ``In'' or ``Packed in'' or the words ``Solid pack'', where applicable, shall be included as part of the name or in close proximity to the name of the food, except that ``Halves'' may be alternately designated as ``Halved'', ``Halves and pieces'' as ``Halved and pieces'', ``Quarters'' as ``Quartered'', ``Slices'' as ``Sliced'', and ``Dice'' as ``Diced''.

Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Quality. (1) The standard of quality for canned peaches is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of quality for canned peaches is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maturity. All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by weight of not more than 300 grams (10.6 ounces).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum size. In the case of halves and quarters styles, the weight of each unit is not less than 17 grams (0.6 ounce) and 8.5 grams (0.3 ounce), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Uniformity of size--(a) Whole, halves, and quarters. In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, the diameter (width) of the largest unit is not more than 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inch) greater than the diameter (width) of the smallest unit. In containers with more than 20 units, 2 units may be disregarded in making the determination. Where a unit has broken in the container, the combined broken pieces are to be reassembled to approximate a single unit of the appropriate style.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Chunky. In the case of chunky style, not more than 25 percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists of units that will pass through an opening 13 millimeters (0.5 inch) wide or that are more than 44 millimeters (1.75 inches) along the longest cut edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Peel. Not more than 15 square centimeters aggregate area of peel per 1,000 grams (1.05 square inches per 16 ounces) of net weight. Include any peel adhering to the peach or loose in the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Blemished units. Not more than 20 percent by count of the units in the container are blemished, e.g., with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormalities. Blemished units

are units which contain surface discolorations that definitely contrast with the overall color and may penetrate into the flesh.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Trimmed units. In the case of whole, halves, quarters, and slices styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Crushed or broken units. In the case of whole, halves, halves and pieces, quarters, slices, dice and chunky styles, not more than 5 percent by count of the units in containers of 20 or more units and not more than 1 unit in containers of fewer than 20 units are crushed or broken. A unit that has lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered crushed or broken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Pits and pieces of pit. In the case of all styles, except whole peaches and when whole peach pits or peach kernels are used as seasoning ingredients, there is not more than one loose pit or one loose large hard piece of pit (10 millimeters (\3/8\ inch) or larger) or one unit of peach (e.g., peach half or peach slice) to which one or more large hard pieces of pit are attached per 5.67 kilograms (200 ounces) net weight. In addition, there is not more than three of any one or any combination of two or more, per 2.83 kilograms (100 ounces) net weight of the following: (a) A unit to which one or more small hard pieces of pit less than 10 millimeters (\3/8\ inch) but not less than 1.6 millimeters (\1/16\ inch) are attached, (b) a unit to which three or more small pieces of pit less than 1.6 millimeters (\1/16\ inch) are attached, or (c) a loose small hard piece of pit less than 10 millimeters (\3/8\ inch).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Canned peaches shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 29 millimeters (1.125 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with a rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by a support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.53 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.45 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less, except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random, in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine compliance as specified in Sec. 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel, pits, and pieces of pit based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in Sec. 145.3(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the quality of canned peaches falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality defined in Sec. 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned peaches falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i)

through (viii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (``Good Food--Not High Grade'') a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned peaches fail to meet, as follows: (i) ``Not tender''; (ii) ``Small halves'' or ``Small quarters'' as the case may be; (iii) (a) ``Mixed sizes''; (b) ``Undersized and/or oversized pieces'', (iv) ``Excess peel''; (v) ``Blemished''; (vi) ``Unevenly trimmed''; (vii) ``Partly crushed or broken''; (viii) ``Contains pits or pit fragments''. Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name ``peaches'' and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fill of container. (1) The standard of fill of container for canned peaches is the maximum quantity of the optional peach ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of fill of container for canned peaches is the maximum quantity of the optional peach ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If canned peaches fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in Sec. 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
