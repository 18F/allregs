                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are also different rules for instructional employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules apply except in circumstances when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An instructional employee begins leave more than five weeks before the end of a term. The employer may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if --</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The leave will last at least three weeks, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee would return to work during the three-week period before the end of the term.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee begins leave during the five-week period before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered servicemember. The employer may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The leave will last more than two weeks, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee would return to work during the two-week period before the end of the term.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee begins leave during the three-week period before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered servicemember. The employer may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more than five working days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of these provisions, academic term means the school semester, which typically ends near the end

of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or semesters each year for purposes of FMLA. An example of leave falling within these provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of leave to care for a family member which will begin three weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the employer could require the employee to stay out on leave until the end of the term.</p>
