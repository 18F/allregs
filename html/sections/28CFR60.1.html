                            <p class="depth0">This regulation authorizes certain categories of federal law  enforcement officers to request the issuance of search warrants under  Rule 41, Fed. R. Crim. P., and lists the agencies whose officers are so  authorized. Rule 41(a) provides in part that a search warrant may be  issued ``upon the request of a federal law enforcement officer,'' and  defines that term in Rule 41(h) as ``any government agent, * * * who is  engaged in the enforcement of the criminal laws and is within the  category of officers authorized by the Attorney General to request the  issuance of a search warrant.'' The publication of the categories and  the listing of the agencies is intended to inform the courts of the  personnel who are so authorized. It should be noted that only in the  very rare and emergent case is the law enforcement officer permitted to  seek a search warrant without the concurrence of the appropriate U.S.  Attorney's office. Further, in all instances, military agents of the  Department of Defense must obtain the concurrence of the appropriate  U.S. Attorney's Office before seeking a search warrant.  [Order No. 826-79, 44 FR 21785, Apr. 12, 1979, as amended by Order No.  1026-83, 48 FR 37377, Aug. 18, 1983]</p>
