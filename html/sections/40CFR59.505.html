These items do not have to be identified individually in the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All individual compounds present in the coating in an amount equal to or exceeding 0.1 percent will be considered ingredients regardless of whether or not the ingredient is reported to the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All individual compounds present in the coating in an amount less than 0.1 percent will be assigned an RF value of 0.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any component that is a VOC but is not listed in Table 2A, 2B, or 2C of this subpart is assigned an RF value as detailed in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may use either formulation data (including information for both the liquid and propellant phases), California Air Resources Board Method 310--Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Consumer Products and Reactive Organic Compounds in Aerosol Coating Products (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA's Method 311--Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), to calculate the PWR.

As provided in Sec. 59.511(j), any petitions submitted to EPA on or before June 1, 2008, will be considered, and if appropriate, incorporated into Table 2A on or before January 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the VOC is used in a product but not listed in Table 2A of this regulation, and has an RF less than or equal to 0.3, and will be used at a level greater than or equal to 7.3 weight percent (g of compound/g product) in any of the regulated entity's formulations, the regulated entity may petition EPA as described in Sec. 59.511(j).
