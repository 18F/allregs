                            <p class="depth0">Emergency operations under Public Law 84-99 apply to Flood Response and Post Flood Response activities. Flood Response activities include flood fighting, rescue operations, and protection of Corps-constructed hurricane/shore protection projects. Post Flood Response activities include certain limited activities intended to prevent imminent loss of life or significant public

property, or to protect against significant threats to public health and welfare, and are intended to bridge the time frame between the occurrence of a disaster and the provision of disaster relief efforts under authority of The Stafford Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flood Response. Flood Response measures are applicable to any flood control work where assistance is supplemental to tribal, State, and local efforts, except that Corps assistance is not appropriate to protect flood control works constructed, previously repaired, and/or maintained by other Federal agencies, where such agencies have emergency flood fighting authority. Further, Flood Response measures (except technical assistance) are not appropriate for flood control works protecting strictly agricultural lands. Corps assistance in support of other Federal agencies, or State and local interests, may include the following: technical advice and assistance; lending of flood fight supplies, e.g., sandbags, lumber, polyethylene sheeting, or stone; lending of Corps-owned equipment; hiring of equipment and operators for flood operations; emergency contracting; and similar measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Post Flood Response. The Corps may furnish Post Flood Response assistance for a period not to exceed 10 days (the statutory limitation) from the date of the Governor's request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an emergency or disaster declaration under authority of the Stafford Act. Requests for Post Flood Response assistance must be made by the Governor of the affected State, except that requests for assistance on lands held in trust by the United States, or on lands of the Alaska Natives, may be submitted directly by the affected federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation, or through the appropriate regional representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or through the Governor of the State in which the lands are located. Assistance from the Corps may include the following: provision of technical advice and assistance; cleaning of drainage channels, bridge openings, or structures blocked by debris deposited during a flood event, where the immediate threat of flooding of or damage to public facilities has not abated; removal of debris blockages of critical water supply intakes, sewer outfalls, etc.; clearance of the minimum amounts of debris necessary to reopen critical transportation routes or public services/facilities; other assistance required to prevent imminent loss of life or significant damage to public property, or to protect against significant threats to public health and welfare. Post Flood Response assistance is supplemental to the maximum efforts of non-Federal interests.</p>
