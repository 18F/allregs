Sec. 40.199 and 40.203).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review the negative laboratory test result and ensure that it is  consistent with the information contained on the CCF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before you report a negative test result, you must have in your  possession the following documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other CCF copy  containing the employee's signature; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A legible copy (fax, photocopy, image) of Copy 1 of the CCF or  the electronic laboratory results report that conveys the negative  laboratory test result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the copy of the documentation provided to you by the  collector or laboratory appears unclear, you must request that the  collector or laboratory send you a legible copy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On Copy 2 of the CCF, place a check mark in the ``Negative'' box  (Step 6), provide your name, and sign, initial, or stamp and date the  verification statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Report the result in a confidential manner (see Sec. Sec.  40.163-40.167).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Staff under your direct, personal supervision may perform the  administrative functions of this section for you, but only you can  cancel a test.

However, you need not review more  than 500 negative results in any quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your review must, as a minimum, include the CCF, negative  laboratory test result, any accompanying corrective documents, and the  report sent to the employer. You must correct any errors that you  discover. You must take action as necessary to ensure compliance by your  staff with this part and document your corrective action. You must  attest to the quality assurance review by initialing the CCFs that you  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must make these CCFs easily identifiable and retrievable by  you for review by DOT agencies.
