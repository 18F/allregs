                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time the committee meets to consider free and reserve  percentages for a crop year, the committee shall consider the marketing  of reserve tonnage raisins for the subsequent 12-month period. The  committee shall dispose of all reserve tonnage in such manner as to  achieve, as nearly as may be practicable, maximum disposal of   such raisins by the time reserve tonnage raisins from the subsequent  crop year are available. Any reserve tonnage raisins held unsold by the  committee on May 1 of the subsequent crop year shall be physically  disposed of promptly in any available outlet not competitive with normal  market channels for free tonnage raisins or sales of new crop reserve  tonnage raisins in export: Provided, That, whenever the Secretary finds,  based upon a recommendation of the committee, or on the basis of  information otherwise available to him that because of national  emergency, crop failure, an insufficient supply of reserve tonnage  raisins for export, or other change of economic or marketing conditions,  retention of reserve tonnage raisins carried over is warranted, the  foregoing requirements as to disposal shall not apply and such raisins  may be disposed of in any outlet recommended by the committee and  approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reserve tonnage raisins shall be disposed of by the committee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By sale to handlers for sale in specified outlets or for resale  to exporters for sale in export outlets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By direct sale to any agency of the U.S. Government for  noncompetitive use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By direct sale to foreign government agencies or foreign  importers in any country not listed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  section or where the procurement of raisins is so regulated as to  preclude purchases from domestic handlers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By gift; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> By any other means consistent with the provisions of this  section, and in outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage  raisins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The committee shall sell reserve raisins to handlers for export  sale to countries on a list established by the Secretary, on the basis  of the recommendation of the committee or from other available  information. The list of countries shall be reviewed by the committee  annually when it reviews matters relating to the free tonnage, and shall  recommend any changes in the list to the Secretary for approval. No  country may be removed from the list for the purpose of permitting  direct sale by the committee unless a finding is made by the committee  and approved by the Secretary, that such removal and subsequent direct  sale by the committee shall not lead to disruption of sale of reserve  tonnage raisins by handlers in other countries on the list, and that  although handlers have been able to offer reserve tonnage raisins at  competitive prices to the country to be so removed, there remains an  unfilled demand in such country which has not been supplied by handlers  and which could be supplied by the committee at the same prices by means  of direct sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reserve tonnage raisins shall be sold to handlers at prices  and in a manner intended to maximum producer returns and achieve maximum  disposition of such raisins by the time reserve tonnage raisins from the  subsequent crop year are available. The committee may pay the cost of  transporting reserve tonnage from one handler to another and in the  event a handler has more than one plant, the committee may pay the cost  of transporting reserve tonnage to the handler's plant of its choice. In  each offer or reoffer of reserve tonnage raisins for export, the  committee may include a quantity of raisins not to exceed 2 percent of  the total tonnage offered in such offer or reoffer, which it may sell to  handlers whose regular allocation provides insufficient tonnage to fill  a containerized freight shipping container: Provided, That such sale may  be made only when the remaining portion of a handler's regular  allocation will fill at least 50 percent of such container and shall be  made to a handler only one time in each offer or reoffer of reserve  tonnage raisins. No offer or reoffer shall be made until 5 days  (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) have elapsed from the  time it files with the Secretary complete information as to varietal  type, quantity, and price involved in such offer or reoffer, and the  Secretary may disapprove the offer or reoffer or any term thereof:  Provided, That at any time prior to the expiration of the 5-day period,  the offer or reoffer may be made to handlers upon the committee  receiving from the Secretary notice that he does not disapprove the  making of the offer or   reoffer. Subject to the same conditions as are set forth in the  preceding sentence with respect to the making of such offer or reoffer,  the committee may withdraw an offer or reoffer to sell reserve tonnage  raisins to handlers or may extend the offer or reoffer period but not  when such extension would deprive one or more handlers of an opportunity  to purchase raisins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for the final offer of the reserve tonnage from a crop  year, an offer of reserve tonnage raisins for export shall provide for a  specific tonnage. Each handler's share of the reserve tonnage offered  prior to November 1 of any crop year shall be determined as the same  proportion of the quantity offered that the free tonnage raisins  acquired by him during the preceding crop year is of the free tonnage  raisins acquired by all handlers during the preceding crop year who  remain handlers. If reserve tonnage raisins have been removed by the  committee from a handler's premises pursuant to Sec. 989.66(f), such  handler's allocation of reserve pool offers subsequent to such removal  and prior to November 1 of the following crop year shall be reduced by  the percentage such removed reserve tonnage is of the total reserve  tonnage acquired by such handler in the crop year. Subsequent to October  31, each handler's share shall be determined as the same proportion of  the quantity offered that the free tonnage raisins acquired by the  handler during the then current crop year is of the total free tonnage  raisins acquired by all handlers during the then current crop year. With  respect to any offer other than the initial offer, each handler's share  of the total quantity offered as of that date (the then current offer  plus all prior offers of that crop year) shall first be determined by  the appropriate formula. His share of the current offer shall then be  determined by subtracting from his share of the total quantity offered,  the total of his share of prior offers from the beginning of the crop  year. If any handler did not acquire raisins during the preceding crop  year, the basis for his share of any quantity of reserve tonnage raisins  offered prior to November 1 shall be his acquisitions of free tonnage  raisins during the then current crop year. The current free tonnage  acquisitions of all such new handler shall, for the purposes of  determining the shares of all handlers prior to November 1, be added to  the total acquisitions of free tonnage raisins during the preceding crop  year of all handlers in business at the time the offer is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to any offer of reserve tonnage for sale to  handlers for resale in export, the committee may provide that any such  tonnage unpurchased at the end of the share reservation period will be  reoffered to handlers without regard to shares and that approval for  handlers' applications for purchase may be made in the same order in  which the applications are received by the committee. Such reoffer may  be made by the committee at the time it makes a regular offer of reserve  tonnage, at any time during the period a regular offer is in effect, or  within a reasonable time after a regular offer has expired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The final offer of the reserve tonnage from a crop year may be  offered to handlers without regard to shares and approval of handlers'  applications for purchase may be made in the same order in which the  applications are received by the committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whenever a handler's share or allocation pursuant to this  paragraph is less than or exceeds his holdings of reserve tonnage by a  minor quantity, the committee may adjust the handler's share or  allocation so as to avoid the cost of the physical transfer. The maximum  quantity by which a handler's share or allocation may be so allocated  shall be prescribed in rules and procedures which the committee shall  establish with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The committee may sell reserve tonnage raisins as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section only when such country is not included  in the list of specified countries established pursuant to paragraph (c)  of this section and may sell reserve tonnage raisins to foreign  government agencies of foreign importers in any country removed from  such list. No agreement to sell reserve tonnage raisins shall be entered  into by the committee until 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and  holidays) have elapsed from the time it   files with the Secretary complete information as to varietal type,  quantity, price and foreign country involved in any such proposed sale,  and the Secretary may disapprove such sale or any term thereof:  Provided, That, at any time prior to the expiration of the 5-day period,  the sale may be made upon the committee receiving from the Secretary  notice that he does not disapprove the making of the sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever the committee concludes that the orderly disposition of  reserve tonnage would be promoted by the committee replacing any portion  or all of handlers' export shipments of free tonnage raisins, to other  than free tonnage outlets, made prior to the committee's first offer to  sell reserve tonnage, it may do so and may specify such requirements and  conditions as are necessary to carry out the replacement consistent with  the objectives of this amended subpart. The committee may establish a  price for such replacement tonnage which is higher, the same as, or  lower than that for reserve tonnage in the first offer of the crop year.  Any such replacement offer by the committee shall be governed by those  provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section which prescribe prior  action by the Secretary on committee offers to sell tonnage to handlers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The committee may, subject to review by the Secretary, refuse  to sell reserve tonnage raisins for export:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To any handler who is in default on any previous purchase of  reserve tonnage raisins from the committee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To any handler currently not in compliance with the provisions  of a sales agreement covering reserve tonnage raisins, executed by such  handler with the committee; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To any handler who signifies an intention to sell reserve  tonnage to or through any person who has previously failed to complete a  sale of reserve tonnage raisins to a foreign buyer and such raisins  remain to be exported and remain unsold to any foreign buyer in an  eligible export market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Handlers who are in default of timely payment under any purchase  agreement are subject to an interest and late payment charge(s)  recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary on the  delinquent amount that is owed the committee. The interest charge shall  be the current prime rate plus 2 percent established by the bank in  which the committee has its administrative assessment funds deposited,  on the day the amount owed becomes delinquent; and further, that such  rate of interest be added to the bill monthly until the handler's  delinquent amount owed plus applicable interest has been paid: Provided,  That the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may recommend  changes in the rate of interest to another rate of interest. When the  committee determines to change the rate of interest or a late payment  charge is needed, and such change is approved by the Secretary, the  committee shall announce the change in the rate of interest or the rate  of late payment charge through a mailing by the committee to handlers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appeals. If a determination is made by the committee that a  handler has not complied with the provisions of this section and any  actions allowed under this section are taken against the handler, such  handler may request a hearing before an appeals subcommittee established  by the committee. If the handler disagrees with the subcommittee's  decisions, the handler may request the committee to review the  subcommittee's decision. The committee may, subject to the approval of  the Secretary, establish additional procedures concerning appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each packer's share of an offer of reserve tonnage raisins for  contract packing shall be determined as the same proportion that the  reserve tonnage raisins acquired by him is of the reserve tonnage  raisins acquired by all packers. In the event that any packer fails to  contract for packing any or all of his share of any offer, the remaining  portion thereof shall be reoffered by the committee to all packers who  contracted for packing all of their respective shares, in proportion to  their respective acquisitions: Provided, That, if such amount which  packers fail to contract for packing does not exceed 250 tons, or if it  is necessary to deviate from the foregoing in order to meet terms and  conditions of shipment, the committee may, in its discretion, allocate  such reserve tonnage raisins   among packers as it deems appropriate, but the shares of packers in  subsequent offers or reoffers shall be adjusted accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> In the event the committee determines that the applicable  procedures as specified in paragraphs (d) and (h) of this section will  not provide an allocation for handlers which is suitable for a  particular situation, the committee, with the approval of the Secretary,  may establish such modifications of procedures, consistent with Sec.  989.66(e), as will facilitate the disposition of reserve tonnage through  the handlers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The committee shall not sell reserve tonnage raisins of any  varietal type to handlers to provide them with raisins to sell as free  tonnage, other than as provided in Sec. 989.54, unless it files with  the Secretary complete information and receives from the Secretary  notice that he does not disapprove of such sale and that because of:  National emergency, crop failure; change of economic or marketing  conditions; free tonnage shipments during the then current crop year  exceeding shipments of a comparable period of the prior crop year by  more than 5 percent: Provided, That, such sale of reserve tonnage shall  be limited to the quantity exceeding 105 percent of shipments for the  first 10 months of the prior crop year; and/or an inadequate carryover,  the free tonnage outlets cannot be reasonably well supplied by the  tonnage released to the industry as a whole by the committee's marketing  policy for that varietal type. Any quantities of reserve raisins offered  to handlers for free use, except as provided in Sec. 989.54(g), may be  offered to them on the basis of handler shipments or acquisitions in the  same manner as in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If offered on the  basis of acquisitions, shares shall be determined pursuant to paragraph  (d)(2) of this section. If offered on the basis of shipments, the same  formula shall be used, except that shipments shall be used as the basis  instead of acquisitions in computing handlers' shares. However, such  raisins shall not be sold at a price below that which the committee  concludes reflects the average price received by producers for free  tonnage of the same varietal type purchased by handlers during the  current crop year up to the time of any offer for sale of reserve  tonnage by the committee, to which shall be added the costs to the  equity holders incurred by the committee on account of receiving,  inspecting, storing, fumigating, insuring, and holding of said raisins,  and including costs of taxes and interest: Provided, That, where the  outlook for the next crop year or other factors have caused a downward  trend in the prices received by producers for free tonnage raisins or in  the prices received by handlers for free tonnage packed raisins, reserve  tonnage may be sold to handlers at the currently prevailing or the  approximate computed field price for free tonnage raisins, as determined  by the committee. The committee may sell reserve tonnage raisins of any  varietal type to any handler to provide him with raisins to sell as free  tonnage if such handler has lost all or part of his free tonnage because  of fire or other disaster beyond his control subject to the applicable  provisions of this paragraph and in an amount equal to such tonnage so  lost.
