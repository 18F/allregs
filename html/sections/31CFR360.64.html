                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment of bonds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an adult owner of bonds is incapable  of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other  person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person,  responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application  for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the  owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds  does not exceed $20,000. The bonds and application should be submitted  to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal  Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the  date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for  payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal  representative must be appointed, as set forth in Sec. 360.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reinvestment of bonds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the bonds have matured and ceased  earning interest, they may be redeemed and the proceeds reinvested in  any other savings bonds available. The new bonds must be registered in  the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he  or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, ``John Jones 123- 45-6789, under voluntary guardianship''. A living coowner or beneficiary  named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless  such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of  his or her name.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any  authorized denomination of savings bond remains after the reinvestment,  the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to  purchase another savings bond of the lowest available denomination. If  additional funds are not furnished, the remaining amount will be paid to  the voluntary guardian for the use and benefit of the incapacitated  person.</p>
