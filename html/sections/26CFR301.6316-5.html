                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time and place to pay. The unpaid tax required to be shown on a  return filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6316-4, whether payable in  whole or in part in foreign currency, is due and payable to the Director  of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.  20225, at the time the return is filed. However, see paragraph (d) of  this section with respect to the depositing of the foreign currency with  the disbursing officer of the Department of State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of Sec.  301.6316-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of the tax. In determining the tax payable for the  taxable year in U.S. dollars, the taxpayer, with respect to amounts  described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6316-1, or amounts described in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6316-1 received before November 1, 1965,  shall use the rates of exchange which most clearly reflect the correct  tax liability in dollars, whether it be the official rate, the open  market rate, or any other appropriate rate. With respect to amounts  described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6316-1 received on or after  November 1, 1965, the taxpayer shall use the official rate of exchange  in determining the tax payable for the taxable year in U.S. dollars.  After determining the correct tax liability in U.S. dollars the taxpayer  shall then ascertain, in accordance with the principles of Sec.  301.6316-3, the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts  received in nonconvertible foreign currency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deposit of foreign currency with disbursing officer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After  the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received in  nonconvertible foreign currency is determined in U.S. dollars, the  amount so determined shall be deposited in the same nonconvertible  foreign currency with the disbursing officer of the Department of State  for the foreign country where the fund is located from which the  payments in nonconvertible foreign currency are made to the taxpayer.  The amount of foreign currency to be deposited shall be that amount  which, when converted at the rate of exchange used on the date of  deposit by that disbursing officer for the acquisition of such currency  for his official disbursements, equals the portion of the tax so  determined in U.S. dollars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The disbursing officer may rely upon the taxpayer for the  determination of the amount of tax payable in foreign currency but may  not accept any such currency for deposit until the taxpayer has  presented for inspection the certified statement referred to in  paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 301.6316-4. Upon acceptance of foreign  currency for deposit the disbursing officer shall give the taxpayer a  receipt in duplicate showing the name and address of the depositor, the  date of the deposit, the amount of foreign currency deposited, and its  equivalent in U.S. dollars on the date of deposit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Every taxpayer making a deposit of foreign currency in  accordance with this paragraph shall attach to the return required to be  filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6316-4, in part or full payment of  the taxes shown thereon, the   original of the receipt given by the disbursing officer and shall pay to  the Director of International Operations in U.S. dollars the balance, if  any, of the tax shown to be due. Tender of such receipt to the Director  of International Operations shall be considered as payment of tax in an  amount equal to the U.S. dollars represented by the receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A taxpayer shall make the deposit required by this paragraph in  ample time to permit him to attach the receipt to his return for filing  within the time prescribed by section 6072 or 6081 and Sec. Sec.  1.6072-1, 1.6081-1, and 1.6081-2 of this chapter (Income Tax  Regulations).</p>
