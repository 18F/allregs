                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Provisions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section provides the basic  procedures for DoD support to special events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As appropriate, amplifying procedures regarding DoD support to  special events shall be published separately and maintained by the  Office of the ASD(HD&ASA;) and released as needed in the most effective  medium consistent with DoD Directive 8320.02 (see http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/corres/pdf/832002p.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special Event Process. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Engagement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Engagement may be  initiated by the Department of Defense, civil authorities, or qualifying  entities. If the initial engagement is not a written request for  assistance (RFA), representatives of the ASD(HD&ASA;) and the Joint Staff  will confer to determine actual requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Engagement may involve informational briefings and meetings  between DoD representatives and special event organizers, civil  authorities, or qualifying entities. These informal engagements may  result in non-DoD entities submitting an RFA to the DoD Executive  Secretary, requesting DoD support for a special event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once an RFA is received, it will be sent to the ASD(HD&ASA;)  and the CJCS simultaneously for staffing and recommendation. Additional  engagement with the requestor may be required to quantify the scope and  magnitude of the support requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planning. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The direction and focus of DoD special-event  planning will depend on the nature of the event and scope and magnitude  of the support requested or anticipated. International events may  require additional planning, procedures, and coordination with the  government of the host country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For National Special Security Events (NSSEs) and events that  may require the employment of military forces and centralized command  and control, the CJCS will issue a planning order requesting a Combatant  Commander to initiate planning and notify potential supporting commands  or organizations and the Chief, NGB, as appropriate. When possible,  established CJCS-directed planning procedures will be used for the  Combatant Commander to provide an assessment and request for forces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The NSSE designation process generally is initiated by a formal  written request to the Secretary of Homeland Security by the State or  local government hosting the event. In other situations where the event  is federally sponsored, an appropriate Federal official will make the  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Once the request is received by DHS, the USSS and the FBI will  send an NSSE questionnaire to the responsible host official for  completion. The request, completed questionnaires, and other supporting  information are reviewed by the NSSE Working Group (which includes a  non-voting DoD member), which provides a recommendation to the Secretary  of Homeland Security regarding NSSE designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Secretary of Homeland Security makes the final determination  to   designate an event as an NSSE pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 7 (see http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-2003-book2/pdf/PPP- 2003-book2-doc-pg1739.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There are numerous events where DoD support should be  anticipated and a planning order issued to the appropriate Combatant  Commander. These include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The President's State of the Union Address or other addresses to  a Joint Session of Congress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Annual meetings of the United Nations General Assembly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> National Presidential nominating conventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Presidential inaugural activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> International summits or meetings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> State funerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The National Boy Scout Jamboree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Certain international or domestic sporting competitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There are other events that the Department of Defense supports  that do not involve the assignment of military forces or centralized  command and control by Combatant Commanders, which include planning  requirements by the host organizations. These include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Military Department or Service-sponsored events, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Marine Corps Marathon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Army 10-Miler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Navy Fleet Weeks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Installation or Joint Service Open Houses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Service or Joint Air Shows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Community relations activities authorized in accordance with  DoDI 5410.19.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Department of Defense may provide support to certain  sporting events that are included under subsection (c) of section 2564  of title 10, U.S.C., by providing technical, contracting, and  specialized equipment support. These events may be funded by the SISC  Defense Account pursuant to title 10 U.S.C. 2564 and include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Special Olympics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Paralympics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sporting events sanctioned by the United States Olympic  Committee (USOC) through the Paralympic Military Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other international or domestic Paralympic sporting events that  are held in the United States or its territories, governed by the  International Paralympic Committee, and sanctioned by the USOC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For which participation exceeds 100 amateur athletes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In which at least 10 percent of the athletes participating in  the sporting event are either members or former members of U.S. Military  Services who are participating in the sporting event based upon an  injury or wound incurred in the line of duty or veterans who are  participating in the sporting event based upon a service-connected  disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Planning for DoD support to the Olympics and certain other  sporting events requires additional considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Subsections (a) and (b) of section 2564 of title 10, U.S.C.,  authorize the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance for the  Olympics and certain other sporting events. Unless the event meets the  specific requirements stated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the  Attorney General must certify that DoD security and safety assistance is  necessary to meet essential security and safety needs of the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Department of Defense, led by the ASD(HD&ASA;), will  collaborate with the CJCS, the Department of Justice, including the FBI,  and other appropriate DoD Components and Federal departments or  agencies, usually as part of a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC), to  provide a recommendation to the Attorney General on what categories of  support the Department of Defense may be able to provide to meet  essential security and safety needs of the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Support other than safety and security may be authorized for  sporting events, but only to the extent that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such needs cannot reasonably be met by a source other than the  Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such assistance does not adversely affect military preparedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requestor of such assistance agrees to reimburse the  Department of   Defense, in accordance with the provisions of title 10 U.S.C. 377, 2553- 2555, and 2564; title 31 U.S.C. 1535-1536; and other applicable  provisions of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Types of support that the Department of Defense can provide  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Aviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Communications (e.g., radios, mobile telephones, signal  integrators).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Security (e.g., magnetometers, closed-circuit televisions,  perimeter alarm systems, undercarriage inspection devices).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Operations and Command Centers (e.g., design and configuration,  video walls).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Explosive ordnance detection and disposal (technical advice,  explosive ordnance disposal teams, explosive detector dog, dog teams).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Logistics (transportation, temporary facilities, food, lodging).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Ceremonial support (in coordination with the ASD(PA)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat  identification, reduction, and response capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Incident response capabilities (in coordination with the  Department of Justice, DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services,  and in consultation with appropriate State and local authorities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> DoD personnel support of special events is provided using a  total force sourcing solution that may include Active Duty and Reserve  Component military personnel, DoD civilian personnel, and DoD contractor  personnel. The Department of Defense also may decide to respond to  requests for assistance by approving, with the consent of the  Governor(s) concerned, National Guard forces performing duty pursuant to  title 32 U.S.C. 502.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> National Guard personnel conducting support of special events  while on State active duty, at the direction of their Governor or  Adjutant General, are not considered to be providing DoD support of  special events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> This part does not limit or affect Department of Defense and  National Guard personnel volunteering to support special events during  their non-duty time. This volunteer support is not considered as part of  DoD support of special events. Volunteers are prohibited from obligating  or using DoD resources to support a special event while in a volunteer  status except as authorized by separate statute or authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Coordination of DoD support of special events  will likely take place simultaneously with engagement and planning;  operate across the full spectrum of strategic, operational, and tactical  levels; and occur internally among DoD Components and externally with  supported civil authorities and qualifying entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Policy coordination at the departmental level between the  Department of Defense and other Federal departments or agencies is the  responsibility of the ASD(HD&ASA;). Other DoD Components may send  representatives to these meetings with the prior concurrence of the  ASD(HD&ASA;). Standing departmental-level special events coordination  meetings include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> USSS-led NSSE Working Group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DHS-led Special Events Working Group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security-led  International Sporting Event Group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Coordination within the Department of Defense is led by the  ASD(HD&ASA;) and is facilitated by the CJCS for the Combatant Commands  and other joint commands and by other DoD Component Heads for their  constituent elements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The CJCS will work with the Military Service Chiefs, the Chief  of the National Guard Bureau, and the Heads of DoD Components when  subject matter expertise is needed for the event organizers. This will  be based upon location and other criteria, as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inputs to the DHS-produced Integrated Federal Support Overview  (IFSO) will be solicited by the CJCS and sent to the ASD(HD&ASA;) for  consolidation and deconfliction prior to final submission to DHS. DoD  Component Heads not tasked by the Joint Staff will submit their input  directly to the ASD(HD&ASA;).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> RFAs for DoD support will adhere to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An RFA for DoD support to a special event may be made by  Federal,   State, or local civil authorities, or by qualifying entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> RFAs will be in writing and addressed to the Secretary of  Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, or the DoD Executive  Secretary, 1000 Defense, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-1000. DoD  Components who receive RFAs directly from the requestor will immediately  forward them to the DoD Executive Secretary for disposition,  distribution, and tracking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> At a minimum, the RFA will be distributed to the ASD(HD&ASA;) and  the CJCS for staffing and recommendation. If the RFA is for a single  capability for which a DoD Component is the OPR or serves as a DoD  Executive Agent, the RFA is sent to that Component for action with an  information copy provided to the ASD(HD&ASA;) and the CJCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vetting of RFAs will be in accordance with the DoD Global Force  Management process and consistent with criteria published in DoD  8260.03-M, Volume 2 (see http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/ 826003m_vol2.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Heads of DoD Components will consult with the DoD Executive  Secretary on which DoD official will communicate DoD special event  support decisions to the requesting authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Execution. Execution of DoD support of special events is a  shared responsibility. The scope and magnitude of the support being  provided will determine the OPR and level of execution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When joint military forces or centralized command and control of  DoD support to a special event are anticipated or required, a Combatant  Commander may be identified as the supported commander in a properly  approved order issued by the CJCS. The designated Combatant Command  shall be the focal point for execution of DoD support to that special  event with other DoD Components in support. Reporting requirements shall  be in accordance with the properly approved order issued by the CJCS and  standing business practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When there are no joint military forces required and there is  no need for centralized command and control, DoD support of special  events shall be executed by the CJCS or the Head of a DoD Component, as  designated in a properly approved order or message issued by the CJCS.  Oversight of DoD support will be provided by the ASD(HD&ASA;).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As described in the Joint Action Plan for Developing Unity of  Effort, when Federal military forces and State military forces are  employed simultaneously in support of civil authorities in the United  States, appointment of a dual-status commander is the usual and  customary command and control arrangement. Appointment of a dual-status  commander requires action by the President and the appropriate Governor  (or their designees).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recovery. (i) Durable, non-unit equipment procured by the  Department of Defense to support a special event shall be retained by  the CJCS for use during future events in accordance with  Sec. 183.5</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(7)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An after-action report shall be produced by the Combatant  Command or OPR and sent to the ASD(HD&ASA;) and the CJCS within 60 days  of completion of the event.</p>
