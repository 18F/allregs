The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million - $900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy reduction would be limited to $5,000 (5 percent of the difference). Thus, the PHA would receive an operating subsidy amount pursuant to this rule plus a transition-funding amount of $95,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $5,000 reduction limit).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a PHA can demonstrate a successful conversion to the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part, as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will discontinue the reduction at the PHA's next subsidy calculation following such demonstration, as reflected in the schedule in paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding Sec. 990.290(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The schedule for successful demonstration of conversion to asset management for discontinuation of PHA subsidy reduction is reflected in the table below:</p><p class="depth2">Stop-Loss Demonstration Time Line and Effective Dates----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Reduction stopped      Reduction</p><p class="depth2">Demonstration date by                   Applications due                    at           effective for----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------September 30, 2007..................
