                            <p class="depth0">A variety of methods are used by Federal agencies to ensure that  sufficient funds are available for adequate, long-term care and  maintenance of collections. Those methods include, but are not limited  to, the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal agencies may fund a variety of curatorial activities  using monies appropriated annually by the U.S. Congress, subject to any  specific statutory authorities or limitations applicable to a particular  agency. As appropriate, curatorial activities that may be funded by  Federal agencies include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchasing, constructing, leasing, renovating, upgrading,  expanding, operating, and maintaining a repository that has the  capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services as set  forth in Sec. 79.9 of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Entering into and maintaining on a cost-reimbursable or cost- sharing basis a contract, memorandum, agreement, or other appropriate  written instrument with a repository that has the capability to provide  adequate long-term curatorial services as set forth in Sec. 79.9 of  this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic  Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2), reimbursing a grantee for  curatorial costs paid by the grantee as a part of the grant project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic  Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2), reimbursing a State agency for  curatorial costs paid by the State agency to carry out the historic  preservation responsibilities of the Federal agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conducting inspections and inventories in accordance with Sec.  79.11 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When a repository that is housing and maintaining a collection  can no longer provide adequate long-term curatorial services, as set  forth in Sec. 79.9 of this part, either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Providing such funds or services as may be agreed upon pursuant  to Sec. 79.5(a)(1) of this part to assist the repository in eliminating  the deficiencies; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removing the collection from the repository and depositing it  in another repository that can provide curatorial services in accordance  with the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic  Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2) and section 208(2) of the National  Historic Preservation Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469c-2), for federally  licensed or permitted projects or programs, Federal agencies may charge  licensees and permittees reasonable costs for curatorial activities  associated with identification, surveys, evaluation and data recovery as  a condition to the issuance of a Federal license or permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal agencies may deposit collections in a repository that  agrees to provide curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government.  This generally occurs when a collection is excavated or removed from  public or Indian lands under a research permit issued pursuant to the  Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) or the Archaeological Resources  Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm). A repository also may agree to  provide curatorial services as a public service or as a means of  ensuring direct access to a collection for long-term study and use.  Federal agencies should ensure that a repository that agrees to provide  curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government has sufficient  financial resources to support its operations and any needed  improvements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds provided to a repository for curatorial services should  include costs for initially processing, cataloging and accessioning the  collection as well as costs for storing, inspecting, inventorying,  maintaining, and conserving the collection on a long-term basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection  to be generated during identification and evaluation surveys should be  included in project planning budgets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection  to be generated during data recovery operations should be included in  project mitigation budgets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funds to store, inspect, inventory, maintain and conserve a  collection on a long-term basis should be included in annual operating  budgets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the Federal Agency Official determines that data recovery  costs may exceed the one percent limitation contained in the  Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469c), as  authorized under section 208(3) of the National Historic Preservation  Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469c-2), the limitation may be waived, in  appropriate cases, after the Federal Agency Official has:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtained the concurrence of the Secretary of the U.S. Department  of the Interior by sending a written request to the Departmental  Consulting Archeologist, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,  Washington, DC 20013-7127; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notified the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the  U.S. Senate and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the  U.S. House of Representatives.
