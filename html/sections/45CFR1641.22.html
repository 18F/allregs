material contained in the IPA's response or submitted by an affected recipient. In the case of debarment or removal, when additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, the administrative record also shall consist of any relevant material submitted or presented at such proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure of the OIG to meet a time requirement of this part does not preclude the OIG from debarring, suspending or removing an IPA. In extraordinary circumstances, the OIG may grant an IPA an extension of the time requirements set out in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of decisions. IPAs shall be given prompt notice of the debarring official's decision. A copy of the decision also will be sent to the affected recipient.
