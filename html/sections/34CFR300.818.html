(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(h))</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 300--Excess Costs Calculation</p><p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided, amounts provided to an LEA under Part  B of the Act may be used only to pay the excess costs of providing  special education and related services to children with disabilities.  Excess costs are those costs for the education of an elementary school  or secondary school student with a disability that are in excess of the  average annual per student expenditure in an LEA during the preceding  school year for an elementary school or secondary school student, as may  be appropriate. An LEA must spend at least the average annual per  student expenditure on the education of an elementary school or  secondary school child with a disability before funds under Part B of  the Act are used to pay the excess costs of providing special education  and related services.</p><p class="depth0">Section 602(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.16 require the LEA to compute  the minimum average amount separately for children with disabilities in  its elementary schools and for children with disabilities in its  secondary schools. LEAs may not compute the minimum average amount it  must spend on the education of children with disabilities based   on a combination of the enrollments in its elementary schools and  secondary schools.</p><p class="depth0">The following example shows how to compute the minimum average  amount an LEA must spend for the education of each of its elementary  school children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the Act before  it may use funds under Part B of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">a. First the LEA must determine the total amount of its expenditures  for elementary school students from all sources--local, State, and  Federal (including Part B)--in the preceding school year. Only capital  outlay and debt services are excluded.</p><p class="depth0">Example: The following is an example of a computation for children  with disabilities enrolled in an LEA's elementary schools. In this  example, the LEA had an average elementary school enrollment for the  preceding school year of 800 (including 100 children with disabilities).  The LEA spent the following amounts last year for elementary school  students (including its elementary school children with disabilities):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>....................

Except as otherwise provided, the LEA next must determine the  average annual per student expenditure for its elementary schools  dividing the average number of students enrolled in the elementary  schools of the agency during the preceding year (including its children  with disabilities) into the amount computed under the above paragraph.  The amount obtained through this computation is the minimum amount the  LEA must spend (on the average) for the education of each of its  elementary school children with disabilities.

This ratio is used to determine the proportion of  the LEA's total Part B subgrants under section 611(f) of the Act for  children aged 3 through 21, and under section 619(g) of the Act for  children aged 3 through 5, that is to be expended on services for  parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in  private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.</p><p class="depth0">The following is an example of how the proportionate share is  calculated:</p><p class="depth0">There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in the  Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed private  school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools  and secondary schools located in the LEA for a total of 320 eligible  public and private school children with disabilities (note:  proportionate share for parentally-placed private school children is  based on total children eligible, not children served). The number of  eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities  (20) divided by the total number of eligible public and private school  children with disabilities (320) indicates that 6.25 percent of the  LEA's subgrant must be spent for the group of eligible parentally-placed  children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and  secondary schools located in the LEA. Flintstone School District  receives $152,500 in Federal flow through funds. Therefore, the LEA must  spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the group of  parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in  private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.  (Note: The LEA must calculate the proportionate share of IDEA funds  before earmarking funds for any early intervening activities in  Sec. 300.226).</p><p class="depth0">The following outlines the calculations for the example of how the  proportionate share is calculated.</p><p class="depth0">Proportionate Share Calculation for Parentally-Placed Private</p><p class="depth0">School Children with Disabilities For Flintstone School</p><p class="depth0">District: Number of eligible children with disabilities in public              300</p><p class="depth0">schools in the LEA..........................................

The Optional Elements and Guidelines for Use</p><p class="depth0">Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline  (required) elements. The complete DTBook Element Set reflects the tags  necessary to create the six types of Digital Talking Books and Braille  output. Because of the present necessity to subdivide the creation of  alternate format materials into distinct phases, the Panel determined  that baseline elements would be provided by publishers, and optional  elements would be added to the NIMAS-conformant files by third party  conversion entities. In both circumstances the protocols for tagging  digital files should conform to the most current ANSI/NISO Z39.86  specification. Content converters are directed to the most current DAISY  Structure Guidelines (http://www.daisy.org/z3986/) for guidance on their  use.</p><p class="depth0">Since the publication of the original National File Format report  from which the NIMAS technical specifications were derived, ANSI/NISO  Z39.86-2002 was updated and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005. It may be best  to avoid using the following optional elements which are no longer  included in ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005: style, notice, hr, and levelhd.</p><p class="depth0">Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO  Z39.86-2005 and should be considered optional elements for the NIMAS:  bridgehead, byline, covertitle, dateline, epigraph, linegroup, and poem.  Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 for additional information  regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005  specification, go to http://www.daisy.org/z3986/.</p><p class="depth0">2. Package File</p><p class="depth0">A package file describes a publication. It identifies all other  files in the publication and provides descriptive and access information  about them. A publication must include a package file conforming to the  NIMAS. The package file is based on the Open eBook Publication Structure  1.2 package file specification (For most recent detail please see http:/ /www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2). A  NIMAS package file must be an XML-valid OeB PS 1.2 package file instance  and must meet the following additional standards:</p><p class="depth0">The NIMAS Package File must include the following Dublin Core  (dc:)metadata: dc:Title. dc:Creator (if applicable). dc:Publisher. dc:Date (Date of NIMAS-compliant file creation--yyyy-mm-dd). dc:Format (=``NIMAS 1.0''). dc:Identifier (a unique identifier for the NIMAS-compliant digital  publication, e.g., print ISBN + ``-NIMAS''--exact format to be  determined).   dc:Language (one instance, or multiple in the case of a foreign language  textbook, etc.). dc:Rights (details to be determined). dc:Source (ISBN of print version of textbook).</p><p class="depth0">And the following x-metadata items: nimas-SourceEdition (the edition of the print textbook). nimas-SourceDate (date of publication of the print textbook).</p><p class="depth0">The following metadata were proposed also as a means of facilitating  recordkeeping, storage and file retrieval: dc:Subject (Lang Arts, Soc Studies, etc.). nimas-grade (specific grade level of the print textbook, e.g.; Grade 6). nimas gradeRange (specific grade range of the print textbook, e.g.;  Grades 4-5).</p><p class="depth0">An additional suggestion references the use of:  dc:audience:educationLevel (for the grade and gradeRange identifiers,  noting that Dublin Core recommends using educationLevel with an  appropriate controlled vocabulary for context, and recommends the U.S.  Department of Education's Level of Education vocabulary online at http:/ /www.ed.gov/admin/reference/index.jsp. Using educationLevel obviates the  need for a separate field for gradeRange since dc elements can repeat  more than once. A book used in more than one grade would therefore have  two elements, one with value ``Grade 4'' and another with value ``Grade  5.''</p><p class="depth0">A final determination as to which of these specific metadata  elements to use needs to be clarified in practice. The package manifest  must list all provided files (text, images, etc.). (Note: For purposes of continuity and to minimize errors in  transformation and processing, the NIMAS-compliant digital text should  be provided as a single document.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Modular Extensions</p><p class="depth0">The most current DAISY/NISO standard, formally the ANSI/NISO Z39.86,  Specifications for the Digital Talking Book defines a comprehensive  system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of this standard is  DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a core set of elements needed to  produce most types of books. However, DTBook is not intended to be an  exhaustive vocabulary for all types of books.</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO  standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing,  workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of the  extensions that have been discussed. Visit http://www.daisy.org/z3986/  to learn more about modular extensions.</p><p class="depth0">End    Sec. Appendix D to Part 300--Maintenance of Effort and Early Intervening</p><p class="depth0">Services</p><p class="depth0">LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in  accordance with Sec. 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds for  early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 must do so with caution  because the local maintenance of effort reduction provision and the  authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services are  interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes about the amount of  funds that it uses for one purpose affect the amount that it may use for  the other. Below are examples that illustrate how Secs. 300.205(d) and  300.226(a) affect one another.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the  LEA's total grant (see Sec. 300.226(a)), which is the maximum amount  that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is greater  than the amount that may be used for local maintenance of effort (MOE)  reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's grant from the prior  year's grant) (see Sec. 300.205(a)).</p><p class="depth0">Prior Year's Allocation.................................       $900,000.

In FY 2015-2016, the LEA meets  the compliance standard using all four methods. As a result, in order to  demonstrate that it met the compliance standard using any one of the  four methods in FY 2016-2017, the LEA must expend at least as much as it  did in FY 2015-2016 using that same method. Because the LEA spent the  same amount in FY 2016-2017 as it did in FY 2015-2016, calculated using  a combination of State and local funds and a combination of State and  local funds on a per capita basis, the LEA met the compliance standard  using both of those methods in FY 2016-2017.
