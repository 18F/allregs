                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency may enforce the Act and these regulations through:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from  the agency under the program or activity involved where the recipient  has violated the Act and these regulations. The determination of the  recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an  opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law  judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation or prior to a  hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial  assistance from the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce  any rights of the United States or obligations by the Act and these  regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, state, or  local government agency which will have the effect of correcting a  violation of the Act or these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The agency will limit any termination under Sec. 143.36(a)(1)  to the particular recipient and particular program or activity the  agency finds in violation of these regulations. The agency will not base  any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or  activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial  assistance from the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agency will take no action under paragraph (a) of this  section until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency head has advised the recipient of its failure to  comply with these regulations and has determined that voluntary  compliance cannot be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thirty days have lapsed after the agency head has sent a written  report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees  of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the Federal program  or activity involved. The agency head shall file a report whenever any  action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency head also may defer granting new Federal financial  assistance from the agency to a recipient when a hearing under Sec.  143.36(a)(1) is initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency will not begin a deferral until the recipient has  received a notice of opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 143.36(a)(1).  The agency will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a  hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing  has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the agency  head. The agency will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days  after the close of a hearing unless the hearing results in a finding  against the recipient.</p>
