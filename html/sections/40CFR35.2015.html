                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Regional Administrator will award grant assistance from annual allotments to projects on a State project priority list developed in accordance with an approved State priority system. The State priority system and list must be designed to achieve optimum water quality management consistent with the goals and requirements of the Act. All projects for building treatment works to be funded by EPA must be included on a State project list, except training facilities funded under section 109(b) of the Act and marine CSO projects funded under section 201(n)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State priority system. The State priority system describes the methodology used to rank projects that are considered eligible for assistance. The priority system should give high priority to projects in priority water quality areas. The priority system may also include the administrative, management, and public participation procedures required to develop and revise the State project priority list. The priority system includes at least the following elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria. (i) The priority system shall include at least the following criteria for ranking projects:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The priority system shall include at least the following criteria for ranking projects:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The impairment of classified water uses resulting from existing municipal pollutant discharges; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The extent of surface or ground water use restoration or public health improvement resulting from the reduction in pollution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State may also include other criteria in its priority system for ranking projects, such as the use of innovative or alternative technology, the need to complete a waste treatment system for which a grant for a phase or segment was previously awarded; and the category of need and the existing population affected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In ranking phased and segmented projects States must comply with Sec. 35.2108.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Categories of need. All projects must fit into at least one of the categories of need described in this paragraph to be eligible for funding, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section. States will have sole authority to determine the priority for each category of need.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before October 1, 1984, these categories of need shall include at least the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Secondary treatment (category I);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Treatment more stringent than secondary (category II);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Infiltration/inflow correction (category IIIA);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Major sewer system rehabilitation (category IIIB);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> New collector sewers and appurtenances (category IVA);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> New interceptors and appurtenances (category IVB);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Correction of combined sewer overflows (category V).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After September 30, 1984, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section, these categories of need shall include only the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Secondary treatment or any cost-effective alternative;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Treatment more stringent than secondary or any cost-effective alternative;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> New interceptors and appurtenances; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Infiltration/inflow correction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After September 30, 1984, up to 20 percent (as determined by the Governor) of a State's annual allotment may be used for categories of need other than those listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and for any purpose for which grants may be made under sections 319 (h) and (i) of the Act (including any innovative and alternative approaches for the control of nonpoint sources of pollution).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> After September 30, 1984, the Governor may include in the priority system a category for projects needed to correct combined sewer overflows which result in impaired uses in priority water quality areas. Only projects which comply with the requirements of Sec. 35.2024(a) may be included in this category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Project priority list. The State's annual project priority list is an ordered listing of projects for which the State expects Federal financial assistance. The priority list contains two portions: the fundable portion, consisting of those projects anticipated to be funded from funds available for obligation; and the planning portion, consisting of projects anticipated to be funded from future authorized allotments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State shall develop the project priority list consistent with the criteria established in the approved priority system. In ranking projects, the State must also consider total funds available, needs and priorities set forth in areawide water quality management plans, and any other factors contained in the State priority system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The list shall include an estimate of the eligible cost of each project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public participation. (1) In addition to any requirements in 40 CFR part 25, the State shall hold public hearings as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to any requirements in 40 CFR part 25, the State shall hold public hearings as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before submitting its priority system to the Regional Administrator for approval and before adopting any significant change to an approved priority system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before submitting its annual project priority list to the Regional Administrator for acceptance and before revising its priority list unless the State agency and the Regional Administrator determine that the revision is not significant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the approved State priority system contains procedures for bypassing projects on the fundable portion of the priority list, such bypasses will not be significant revisions for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public hearings may be conducted as directed in the State's continuing planning process document or may be held in conjunction with any regular public meeting of the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Regional Administrator review. The State must submit its priority system, project priority list and revisions of the priority system or priority list to the Regional Administrator for review. The State must also submit each year, by August 31, a new priority list for use in the next fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After submission and approval of the initial priority system and submission and acceptance of the project priority lists under paragraph (c) of this section, the State may revise its priority system and list as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator shall review the State priority system and any revisions to insure that they are designed to obtain compliance with the criteria established in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and the enforceable requirements of

the Act as defined in Sec. 35.2005(b)(15). The Regional Administrator shall complete review of the priority system within 30 days of receipt of the system from the State and will notify the State in writing of approval or disapproval of the priority system, stating any reasons for disapproval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Regional Administrator will review the project priority list and any revisions to insure compliance with the State's approved priority system and the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. The Regional Administrator will complete review of the project priority list within 30 days of receipt from the State and will notify the State in writing of acceptance or rejection, stating the reasons for the rejection. Any project which is not contained on an accepted current priority list will not receive funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with the enforceable requirements of the Act. (1) Except as limited under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Regional Administrator, after a public hearing, shall require the removal of a specific project or portion thereof from the State project priority list if the Regional Administrator determines it will not contribute to compliance with the enforceable requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as limited under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Regional Administrator, after a public hearing, shall require the removal of a specific project or portion thereof from the State project priority list if the Regional Administrator determines it will not contribute to compliance with the enforceable requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator shall not require removal of projects in categories under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (D) through (G) of this section which do not meet the enforceable requirements of the Act unless the total Federal share of such projects would exceed 25 percent of the State's annual allotment.
