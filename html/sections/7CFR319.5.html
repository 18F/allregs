                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Commodity. A plant, plant product, or other agricultural product being moved for trade or other purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for submitting requests and supporting information. Persons who request changes to the import regulations contained in this part and who wish to import plants, plant parts, or plant products that are not allowed importation under the conditions of this part must file a request with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in order for APHIS to consider whether the new commodity can be safely imported into the United States. The initial request can be formal (e.g., a letter) or informal (e.g., made during a bilateral discussion between the United States and another country), and can be made by any person. Upon APHIS confirmation that granting a person's request would require amendments to the regulations in this part, the national plant protection organization of the country from which the commodity would be exported must provide APHIS with the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section before APHIS can proceed with its consideration of the request; requests that are not supported with this information in a timely manner will be considered incomplete and APHIS may not take further action on such requests until all required information is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Addresses. The national plant protection organization of the country from which commodities would be exported must submit the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section to: Commodity Import Analysis and Operations, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Information. The following information must be provided to APHIS in order for APHIS to consider a request to change the regulations in part 319:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information about the party submitting the request. The address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of the national plant protection organization of the country from which commodities would be exported; or, for requests that address a multi-country region, the address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of the exporting countries' national and regional plant protection plant protection organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information about the commodity proposed for importation into the United States. (i) A description and/or map of the specific location(s) of the areas in the exporting country where the plants, plant parts, or plant products are produced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The scientific name (including genus, species, and author names), synonyms, and taxonomic classification of the commodity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identification of the particular plant or plant part (i.e., fruit, leaf, root, entire plant, etc.) and any associated plant part proposed for importation into the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The proposed end use of the imported commodity (e.g., propagation, consumption, milling, decorative, processing, etc.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The months of the year when the commodity would be produced, harvested, and exported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Shipping information: (i) Detailed information as to the projected quantity and weight/Volume of the proposed importation, broken down according to varieties, where applicable, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Method of shipping in international commerce and under what conditions, including type of conveyance, and type, size, and capacity of packing boxes and/or shipping containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Description of pests and diseases associated with the commodity \1\ (i) Scientific name (including genus, species, and author names) and taxonomic classification of arthropods, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, virus, viroids, mollusks, phytoplasmas, spiroplasmas, etc., attacking the crop;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ When a change is being sought to the conditions governing the importation of a commodity that is already authorized for importation into the United States, an update to or confirmation of previously submitted pest and disease information, rather than a new, complete submission of that information, may be appropriate. Persons seeking such a change may contact APHIS for a determination as to whether an update will be appropriate in a particular case.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plant part attacked by each pest, pest life stages associated with each plant part attacked, and location of pest (in, on, or with commodity); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> References.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Current strategies for risk mitigation or management.

None of the additional information listed in this paragraph need be provided at the same time as information required under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section; it is required only upon request by APHIS. If APHIS determines that additional information is required in order to complete a pest risk analysis in accordance with international standards for pest risk analysis, we will notify the party submitting the request in writing what specific additional information is required.
