To  establish the right to sell articles tax free to a State or local  government that is not registered, the manufacturer must obtain from an  authorized official of the State or local government and retain in the  manufacturer's possession either a properly executed exemption  certificate, or a purchase order that contains the same information  required to be furnished in an exemption certificate. See Sec.  53.135(c) for the information necessary to substantiate a tax-free sale  under such circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each State requesting registration will be assigned one  Certificate of Registry. The registration number shown on this  certificate may be used by all agencies, boards, and commissions of the  State that are authorized by the State to make purchases for the  exclusive use of the State. However, the registration number assigned to  a State may not be used by any political subdivision of that State, such  as a county or municipality. Each political subdivision of a State  desiring to obtain a Certificate of Registry must obtain a separate  registration number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> United States. The registration requirements of the regulations  in this part do not apply to purchases and sales by the United States or  any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The evidence required in  support of such tax-free purchases and sales is a notation on the  purchase order or other document furnished to the seller clearly  indicating that the article or articles are being purchased tax free as  authorized by chapter 32 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of Sec. 53.134 are satisfied.
