The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds. A sinking fund should be established to amortize the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial management.

The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis.

If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA. However, since only one loan may be approved, cancellation precludes submission of a second loan application request by the same local government for the same disaster.</p>
