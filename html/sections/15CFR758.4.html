                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License valid for shipment from any port. An export license  issued by BIS authorizes exports from any port of export in the United  States unless the license states otherwise. Items that leave the United  States at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter the  United States at another port before being exported to a foreign  country, are treated as exports from the last U.S. port of export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>  or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BIS grants an extension; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to midnight on the date of expiration on the license, the  items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Were laden aboard the vessel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage,  and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel was expected to be at the pier for loading before  the license expired, but exceptional and unforseen circumstances delayed  it, and BIS or the U.S. Customs Service makes a judgment that undue  hardship would result if a license extension were required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reshipment of undelivered items. If the consignee does not  receive an export made under a license because the carrier failed to  deliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical item,  subject to the same limitations as to quantity and value as described on  the license, to the same consignee and destination under the same  license. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than the  original consignee, the shipment is considered a new export and requires  a new license. Before reshipping, satisfactory evidence of the original  export and of the delivery failure, together with a satisfactory  explanation of the delivery failure, must be submitted by the exporter  to the following address: Operations Division, Bureau of Industry and  Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 2099B, 14th Street &  Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exports against license with approved name changes. If you are  exporting against a license with approved name changes under Sec.  750.7(c)(2) of the EAR, prior to using that export license you are  required to include in the respective name field in AES (e.g., in the  USPPI name field in AES), the new name followed by the original name in  this format ``[new name] f.k.a. [original name].'' This reporting  requirement would be completed by the authorized filer of the electronic  export information (EEI) in AES. Although not required, the exporter may  include a copy of the BIS written response approving the non-material  name changes in accordance with Sec. 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR. If the  items have already been exported against the license by   the time the name changes are approved, you are not required to report  this additional information in AES, but you still must follow the  recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.
