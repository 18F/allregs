                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, the term:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reclamation, which shall be commenced, conducted and completed  as soon after disturbance as feasible without undue physical  interference with mining operations, means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reshaping of the lands disturbed and affected by mining  operations to the approximate original contour or to an appropriate  contour considering the surrounding topography as determined by the  authorized officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restoring such reshaped lands by replacement of topsoil; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revegetating the lands by using species previously occurring in  the area to provide a vegetative cover at least to the point where  natural succession is occuring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environment means surface and subsurface resources both tangible  and intangible, including air, water, mineral, scenic, cultural,  paleontological, vegetative, soil, wildlife, fish and wilderness values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wilderness Study Area means a roadless area of 5,000 acres or  more or roadless islands which have been found through the Bureau of  Land Management wilderness inventory process to have wilderness  characteristics (thus having the potential of being included in the  National Wilderness Preservation System), and which will be subjected to  intensive analysis through the Bureau's planning system, and through  public review to determine wilderness suitability, and is not yet the  subject of a Congressional decision regarding its designation as  wilderness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Impairment of suitability for inclusion in the Wilderness System  means taking actions that cause impacts, that cannot be reclaimed to the  point of being substantially unnoticeable in the area as a whole by the  time the Secretary is scheduled to make a recommendation to the  President on the suitability of a wilderness study area for inclusion in  the National Wilderness Preservation System or have degraded wilderness  values so far, compared with the area's values for other purposes, as to  significantly constrain the Secretary's recommendation with respect to  the area's suitability for preservation as wilderness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mining claim means any unpatented mining claim, millsite, or  tunnel site authorized by the U.S. mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Mining operations means all functions, work, facilities, and  activities in connection with the prospecting, development, extraction,  and processing of mineral deposits and all uses reasonably incident  thereto including the construction and maintenance of means of access to  and across lands subject to these regulations, whether the operations  take place on or off the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Operator means a person conducting or proposing to conduct  mining operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land  Management to whom has been delegated the authority to perform the  duties described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Wilderness inventory means an evaluation conducted under BLM  wilderness inventory procedures which results in a written description  and map showing those lands that meet the wilderness criteria  established under section 603(a) of the Federal Land Policy and  Management Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Manner and degree means that existing operations will be defined  geographically by the area of active development and the logical  adjacent (not necessarily contiguous) continuation of the existing  activity, and not necessarily by the boundary of a particular, claim or  lease, and in some cases a change in the kind of activity if the impacts  from the continuation and change of activity are not of a significantly  different kind than the existing impacts. However, the significant  measure for these activities is still the impact they are having on the  wilderness potential of an area. It is the actual use of the area, and  not the existence of an entitlement for use, which is the controlling  factor. In other words, an existing activity, even if impairing, may  continue to be expanded in an area or progress to the next stage of  development so long as the additional impacts are not significantly  different from those caused by the existing activity. In determining the  manner and degree of existing operations, a rule of reason will be  employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Valid existing right means a valid discovery had been made on a  mining claim on October 21, 1976, and continues to be valid at the time  of exercise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Undue and unnecessary degradation means impacts greater than  those that would normally be expected from an activity being  accomplished in compliance with current standards and regulations and  based on sound practices, including use of the best reasonably available  technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Substantially unnoticeable means something that either is so  insignificant as to be only a very minor feature of the overall area or  is not distinctly recognizable by the average visitor as being manmade  or man-caused because of age, weathering or biological change.</p>
