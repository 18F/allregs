Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section,  the minimum level of financial responsibility for a motor vehicle used  to provide transportation services within a transit service area under  an agreement with a Federal, State, or local government funded, in whole  or in part, with a grant under 49 U.S.C. 5307, 5310 or 5311, including  transportation designed and carried out to meet the special needs of  elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities, will be the  highest level required for any of the States in which it operates. This  paragraph applies to transit service providers who operate in a transit  service area located in more than one State, as well as transit service  providers who operate in only one State but   interline with other motor carriers that provide interstate  transportation within or outside the transit service area. Transit  service providers conducting such operations must register as for-hire  passenger carriers under part 365, subpart A and part 390, subpart E of  this subchapter, identify the State(s) in which they operate under the  applicable grants, and certify on their registration documents that they  have in effect financial responsibility levels in an amount equal to or  greater than the highest level required by any of the States in which  they are operating under a qualifying grant.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
