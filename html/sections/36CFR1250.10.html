                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Most archival records held by NARA have no restrictions to  access and are available to the public for research without filing a  FOIA request. You may either visit a NARA facility as a researcher to  view and copy records or you may write to request copies of specific  records. (See subpart B of 36 CFR part 1256 for more information about  how to access archival records).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are seeking access to archival records that are not yet  available to the public, you need to file a FOIA request. (See 36 CFR  1256.22 for information on how to request access to restricted archival  records. See paragraph (d) of this section, and part 1260, for  additional procedures on access to classified records.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must also file a FOIA request when you request access to  NARA operational records (records NARA creates) that are not already  available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you are requesting records that you know are classified to  protect national security interests, you may wish to use the Mandatory  Declassification Review process, which is set forth at 36 CFR 1260.70.  (Please see NARA's FOIA Guide, available online at http:// www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html, for the differences between the  FOIA   and Mandatory Declassification Review access processes.)</p>
