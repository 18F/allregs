                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Unlike the systems of some other countries, the  United States uses a ``retrospective'' assessment system under which  final liability for antidumping and countervailing duties is determined  after merchandise is imported. Generally, the amount of duties to be  assessed is determined in a review of the order covering a discrete  period of time. If a review is not requested, duties are assessed at the  rate established in the completed review covering the most recent prior  period or, if no review has been completed, the cash deposit rate  applicable at the time merchandise was entered. This section contains  rules regarding the assessment of duties, the provisional measures  deposit cap, and interest on over- or undercollections of estimated  duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment of antidumping and countervailing duties as the  result of a review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Antidumping duties. If the Secretary has  conducted a review of an antidumping order under Sec. 351.213  (administrative review), Sec. 351.214 (new shipper review), or Sec.  351.215 (expedited antidumping review), the Secretary normally will  calculate an assessment rate for each importer of subject merchandise  covered by the review. The Secretary normally will calculate the   assessment rate by dividing the dumping margin found on the subject  merchandise examined by the entered value of such merchandise for normal  customs duty purposes. The Secretary then will instruct the Customs  Service to assess antidumping duties by applying the assessment rate to  the entered value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Countervailing duties. If the Secretary has conducted a review  of a countervailing duty order under Sec. 351.213 (administrative  review) or Sec. 351.214 (new shipper review), the Secretary normally  will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties by  applying the rates included in the final results of the review to the  entered value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Automatic assessment of antidumping and countervailing duties if  no review is requested. (1) If the Secretary does not receive a timely  request for an administrative review of an order (see paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  (b)(2), or (b)(3) of Sec. 351.213), the Secretary, without additional  notice, will instruct the Customs Service to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assess antidumping duties or countervailing duties, as the case  may be, on the subject merchandise described in Sec. 351.213(e) at  rates equal to the cash deposit of, or bond for, estimated antidumping  duties or countervailing duties required on that merchandise at the time  of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To continue to collect the cash deposits previously ordered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, or (b)(3) of Sec.  351.213), the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to assess  antidumping duties or countervailing duties, and to continue to collect  cash deposits, on the merchandise not covered by the request in  accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The automatic assessment provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and  (c)(2) of this section will not apply to subject merchandise that is the  subject of a new shipper review (see Sec. 351.214) or an expedited  antidumping review (see Sec. 351.215).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provisional measures deposit cap. This paragraph applies to  subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for  consumption before the date of publication of the Commission's notice of  an affirmative final injury determination or, in a countervailing duty  proceeding that involves merchandise from a country that is not entitled  to an injury test, the date of the Secretary's notice of an affirmative  final countervailing duty determination. If the amount of duties that  would be assessed by applying the rates included in the Secretary's  affirmative preliminary or affirmative final antidumping or  countervailing duty determination (``provisional duties'') is different  from the amount of duties that would be assessed by applying the  assessment rate under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section  (``final duties''), the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to  disregard the difference to the extent that the provisional duties are  less than the final duties, and to assess antidumping or countervailing  duties at the assessment rate if the provisional duties exceed the final  duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interest on certain overpayments and underpayments. Under  section 778 of the Act, the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service  to calculate interest for each entry on or after the publication of the  order from the date that a cash deposit is required to be deposited for  the entry through the date of liquidation of the entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special rule for regional industry cases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the  Commission, in its final injury determination, found a regional industry  under section 771(4)(C) of the Act, the Secretary may direct that duties  not be assessed on subject merchandise of a particular exporter or  producer if the Secretary determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The exporter or producer did not export subject merchandise for  sale in the region concerned during or after the Department's period of  investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exporter or producer has certified that it will not export  subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned in the future so  long as the antidumping or countervailing duty order is in effect; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No subject merchandise of the exporter or producer was entered  into   the United States outside of the region and then sold into the region  during or after the Department's period of investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for obtaining an exception from the assessment of  duties--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Request for exception. An exporter or producer seeking an  exception from the assessment of duties under paragraph (f)(1) of this  section must request, subject to the provisions of Sec. 351.213 or  Sec. 351.214, an administrative review or a new shipper review to  determine whether subject merchandise of the exporter or producer in  question should be excepted from the assessment of duties under  paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The exporter or producer making the  request may request that the review be limited to a determination as to  whether the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are  satisfied. The request for a review must be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A certification by the exporter or producer that it did not  export subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned during or  after the Department's period of investigation, and that it will not do  so in the future so long as the antidumping or countervailing duty order  is in effect; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A certification from each of the exporter's or producer's U.S.  importers of the subject merchandise that no subject merchandise of that  exporter or producer was entered into the United States outside such  region and then sold into the region during or after the Department's  period of investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limited review. If the Secretary initiates an administrative  review or a new shipper review based on a request for review that  includes a request for an exception from the assessment of duties under  paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary, if requested, may  limit the review to a determination as to whether an exception from the  assessment of duties should be granted under paragraph (f)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception granted. If, in the final results of the  administrative review or the new shipper review, the Secretary  determines that the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are  satisfied, the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate,  without regard to antidumping or countervailing duties (whichever is  appropriate), entries of subject merchandise of the exporter or producer  concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exception not granted. If, in the final results of the  administrative review or the new shipper review, the Secretary  determines that the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) are not satisfied,  the Secretary:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Will issue assessment instructions to the Customs Service in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the review was limited to a determination as to whether an  exception from the assessment of duties should be granted, the Secretary  will instruct the Customs Service to assess duties in accordance with  paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section, whichever is appropriate  (automatic assessment if no review is requested).</p>
