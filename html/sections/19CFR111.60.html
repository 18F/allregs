The broker's request must set forth in what respect the proposed statement of charges leaves him in doubt and must describe the particular language of the proposed statement of charges as to which additional information is needed. If in the opinion of the port director that information is reasonably necessary to enable the broker to prepare his response, he will furnish the broker with that information.</p>
