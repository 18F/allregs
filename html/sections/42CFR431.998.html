                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State may file, in writing, a request with the Federal  contractor to resolve differences in the Federal contractor's findings  based on medical or data processing reviews on FFS and managed care  claims in Medicaid or CHIP within 20 business days after the disposition  report of claims review findings is posted on the contractor's Web site.  The State must complete all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a factual basis for filing the difference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide the Federal contractor with valid evidence directly  related to the error finding to support the State's position that the  claim was properly paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For a claim in which the State and the Federal contractor cannot  resolve the difference in findings, the   State may appeal to CMS for final resolution, filing the appeal within  10 business days from the date the contractor's finding as a result of  the difference resolution is posted on the contractor's Web site. There  is no minimum dollar threshold required to appeal a difference in  findings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For eligibility error determinations made by the agency with  personnel functionally and physically separate from the State Medicaid  and CHIP agencies with personnel that are responsible for Medicaid and  CHIP policy and operations, the State may appeal error determinations by  filing an appeal request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing an appeal request. The State may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> File its appeal request with the appropriate State agency or  entity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no appeals process is in place at the State level,  differences in findings--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Must be documented in writing and submitted directly to the  agency responsible for the PERM eligibility review for its  consideration;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> May be resolved through document exchange facilitated by CMS,  whereby CMS will act as intermediary by receiving the written  documentation supporting the State's appeal from the State agency and  submitting that documentation to the agency responsible for the PERM  eligibility review; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any unresolved differences may be addressed by CMS between the  final month of payment data submission and error rate calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the filing of an appeals request. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any changes in error  findings must be reported to CMS by the deadline for submitting final  eligibility review findings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any appeals of determinations based on interpretations of  Federal policy may be referred to CMS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS's eligibility error resolution decision is final.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If CMS's or the State-level appeal board's decision causes an  erroneous payment finding to be made, if the final adjudicated claim is  actually a payment error in accordance with documented State policies  and procedures, any resulting recoveries are governed by Sec.  431.1002  of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All differences, including those pending in CMS for final  decision that are not resolved in time to be included in the error rate  calculation, will be considered as errors for meeting the reporting  requirements of the IPIA. Upon State request, CMS will calculate a  subsequent State-specific error rate that reflects any reversed  disposition of the unresolved claims.
