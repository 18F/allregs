                                Sec. 245.13  State agencies and direct certification requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direct certification requirements. State agencies are required  to meet the direct certification performance benchmarks set forth in  paragraph (b) of this section for directly certifying children who are  members of households receiving assistance under SNAP. A State agency  that fails to meet the benchmark must develop and submit to FNS a  continuous improvement plan (CIP) to fully meet the requirements of this  paragraph and to improve direct certification for the following school  year in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Direct certification performance benchmarks. State agencies must  meet performance benchmarks for directly certifying for free school  meals children who are members of households receiving assistance under  SNAP. The performance benchmarks are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 80% for the school year beginning July 1, 2011;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 90% for the school year beginning July 1, 2012; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 95% for the school year beginning July 1, 2013, and for each  school year thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Data elements required for direct certification rate  calculation. Each State agency must provide FNS with specific data  elements each year, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Data Element #1--The number of children who are members of  households receiving assistance under SNAP that are directly certified  for free   school meals as of the last operating day in October, collected and  reported in the same manner and timeframes as specified in  Sec. 245.11(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data Element #2--The unduplicated count of children ages 5 to 17  years old who are members of households receiving assistance under SNAP  at any time during the period July 1 through September 30. This data  element must be provided by the SNAP State agency, as required under 7  CFR 272.8(a)(5), and reported to FNS and to the State agency  administering the NSLP in the State by December 1st each year, in  accordance with guidelines provided by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data Element #3-- The count of the number of children who are  members of households receiving assistance under SNAP who attend a  school operating under the provisions of 7 CFR 245.9 in a year other  than the base year or that is exercising the community eligibility  option (CEO). The proxy for this data element must be established each  school year through the State's data matching efforts between SNAP  records and student enrollment records for these special provision  schools that are operating in a non-base year or that are exercising the  CEO. Such matching efforts must occur in or close to October each year,  but no later than the last operating day in October. However, States  that have special provision schools exercising the CEO may alternatively  choose to include, for these schools, the count of the number of  identified students directly matched with SNAP used in determining the  CEO claiming percentage for that school year, or they may choose to use  the count from the SNAP match conducted by April 1 of the same calendar  year, whether or not it was used in the CEO claiming percentages. State  agencies must report this aggregated data element to FNS by December 1st  each year, in accordance with guidelines provided by FNS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State notification. For each school year, FNS will notify State  agencies that fail to meet the direct certification performance  benchmark.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Continuous improvement plan required. A State agency having a  direct certification rate with SNAP that is less than the direct  certification performance benchmarks set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section must submit to FNS for approval, within 90 days of notification,  a CIP in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Continuous improvement plan required components. CIPs must  include, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific measures that the State will use to identify more  children who are eligible for direct certification, including  improvements or modifications to technology, information systems, or  databases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A multiyear timeline for the State to implement these measures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Goals for the State to improve direct certification results for  the following school year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information about the State's progress toward implementing other  direct certification requirements, as provided in FNS guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Continuous improvement plan implementation. A State must  maintain its CIP and implement it according to the timeframes in the  approved plan.  [78 FR 12230, Feb. 22, 2013. Redesignated at 79 FR 7054, Feb. 6, 2014]</p>
