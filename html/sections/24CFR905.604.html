                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Mixed-finance development refers to the development  (through new construction or acquisition, with or without  rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, where the public  housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a  PHA. If the public housing units being developed are 100 percent owned  by the PHA, the project is not a mixed-finance project and will be not  be subject to mixed-finance development requirements. However, all other  development requirements of part 905 are applicable, and, if the project  includes both public housing funds and private funding for development,  the project may be subject to other applicable program requirements;  e.g., the Capital Fund Financing Program, Operating Fund Financing  Program, Public Housing Mortgage Program, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ownership. There are various potential scenarios for the  ownership structure of a mixed-finance project, such as: public housing  units may be   owned entirely by a private entity; a PHA may co-own with a private  entity; or a PHA affiliate or instrumentality may own or co-own the  units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partnerships. PHAs may choose to enter into a partnership or  other contractual arrangement with a third party entity for the mixed- finance development and/or ownership of public housing units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Funding. Funding for mixed-finance developments may include one  or a combination of funding sources, pursuant to Sec. 905.600(d) of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Modernization. A mixed-finance project that involves  modernization, rather than new construction, shall maintain the DOFA  date that existed prior to modernization and shall be subject to the  provisions of Sec. 905.304(a)(2) of this part regarding the applicable  period of obligation to operate the public housing units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions applicable to this subpart. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mixed-finance. The  development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without  rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, using public  housing, nonpublic housing, or a combination of public housing and  nonpublic housing funds, where the public housing units are owned in  whole or in part by an entity other than the PHA. A mixed-finance  development may include 100 percent public housing (if there is an Owner  Entity other than the PHA) or a mixture of public housing and nonpublic  housing units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Owner Entity. As defined in Sec. 905.108 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PHA instrumentality. An instrumentality is an entity related to  the PHA whose assets, operations, and management are legally and  effectively controlled by the PHA, and through which PHA functions or  policies are implemented, and which utilizes public housing funds or  public housing assets for the purpose of carrying out public housing  development functions of the PHA. An instrumentality assumes the role of  the PHA, and is the PHA under the Public Housing Requirements, for  purposes of implementing public housing development activities and  programs, and must abide by the Public Housing Requirements.  Instrumentalities must be authorized to act for and to assume such  responsibilities. For purposes of development, ownership of public  housing units by an instrumentality would be considered mixed-finance  development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> PHA affiliate. An affiliate is an entity, other than an  instrumentality, formed by a PHA and in which a PHA has a financial or  ownership interest or participates in its governance. The PHA has some  measure of control over the assets, operations, or management of the  affiliate, but such control does not rise to the level of control to  qualify the entity as an instrumentality. For the purposes of  development, ownership of public housing units by an affiliate would be  considered mixed-finance development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Public housing funds. As defined in Sec. 905.108 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Structure of projects. Each mixed-finance project must be  structured to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure the continued operation of the public housing units in  accordance with all Public Housing Requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that public housing funds committed to a mixed-finance  project are used only to pay for costs associated with the public  housing units, including such costs as demolition, site work,  infrastructure, and common area improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To ensure that the amount of public housing funds committed to a  project is proportionate to the number of public housing units contained  in the project. To meet this ``pro rata test,'' the proportion of public  housing funds compared to total project funds committed to a project  must not exceed the proportion of public housing units compared to total  number of units contained in the project. For example, if there are a  total of 120 units in the project and 50 are public housing units, the  public housing units are 42 percent of the total number of units in the  project. Therefore the amount of public housing funds committed to the  project cannot exceed 42 percent of the total project budget, unless  otherwise approved by the Secretary. However, if public housing funds  are to be used to pay for more than the pro rata cost of common area  improvements, HUD will evaluate the proposal to ensure that   common area improvements will benefit the residents in the development  in a mixed-income project; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ensure that the project is within the Total Development Cost  (TDC) and Housing Construction Cost (HCC) limits pursuant to Sec.  905.314(c) and (d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Process. Except as provided in this section, development of a  mixed-finance project under this subpart is subject to the same  requirements as development of public housing by a PHA entirely with  public housing funds, as stated in Sec. 905.600 of this part. PHAs must  submit an acquisition proposal under Sec. 905.608 and/or a development  proposal under Sec. 905.606 or as otherwise specified by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between the requirements  for a mixed-finance project and other requirements of this subpart, the  mixed-finance Public Housing Requirements shall apply, unless HUD  determines otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> HUD approval. For purposes of this section only, any action or  approval that is required by HUD pursuant to the requirements set forth  in this section shall be construed to mean HUD Headquarters, unless the  field office is authorized in writing by Headquarters to carry out a  specific function in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Comparability. Public housing units built in a mixed-financed  development must be comparable in size, location, external appearance,  and distribution to nonpublic housing units within the development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Mixed-finance procurement. The requirements of 24 CFR Part 85  and 24 CFR 905.316 are applicable to this subpart with the following  exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> PHAs may select a development partner using competitive  proposals procedures for qualifications-based procurement, subject to  negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation and compliance with TDC  and other applicable cost limitations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An Owner Entity (which, as a private entity, would normally not  be subject to 24 CFR Part 85) shall be required to comply with 24 CFR  Part 85 if HUD determines that the PHA or PHA instrumentality, or either  of their members or employees, exercises significant decision making  functions within the Owner Entity with respect to managing the  development of the proposed units. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis,  exempt such an Owner Entity from the need to comply with 24 CFR Part 85  if it determines that the Owner Entity has developed an acceptable  alternative procurement plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identity of interest. If the Owner Entity or partner (or any  other entity with an identity of interest with the Owner Entity or  partner) of a mixed-finance project wants to serve as the general  contractor for the mixed-finance project, it may award itself the  construction contract only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The identity of interest general contractor's bid is the lowest  bid submitted in response to a request for bids; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The PHA submits a written justification to HUD that includes an  independent third-party cost estimate that demonstrates that the  identity of interest general contractor's costs are less than or equal  to the independent third-party cost estimate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> HUD approves the identity of interest general contractor in  conjunction with HUD's approval of the development proposal for the  mixed-finance project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Operating Subsidy-Only and Capital Fund-Only Assistance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General. This section refers to the mixed-finance development of public  housing units that will be developed without public housing funds but  will receive operating subsidy, or will be developed with public housing  funds but will not receive operating subsidy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operating Subsidy-Only Development. Operating Subsidy-Only  Development refers to mixed-finance projects where public housing units  are developed without the use of public housing funds, but for which HUD  agrees to provide operating subsidies under Section 9(e) of the 1937  Act. These types of project are subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The newly developed public housing units will be included in the  calculation of the Capital Fund formula in Sec. 905.400 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ACC Amendment will be executed to include the new public  housing units. The term of the ACC Amendment will be determined based on  the   assistance as provided in Sec. 905.304, unless reduced by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There shall be no disposition of the public housing units  without the prior written approval of HUD, during, and for 10 years  after the end of, the period in which the public housing units receive  operating subsidy from the PHA, as required by 42 U.S.C. 1437g(3), as  those requirements may be amended from time to time. However, if the PHA  is no longer able to provide operating subsidies to the Owner Entity  pursuant to Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act, the PHA may (on behalf of the  Owner Entity) request that HUD terminate the Declaration of Trust or  Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, as applicable. Termination under  this section does not require disposition approval from HUD pursuant to  Section 18 of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437p. However, the PHA must  provide public housing residents with a decent, safe, sanitary, and  affordable unit to which they can relocate, which may include a public  housing unit in another development or a Housing Choice Voucher, and pay  for the tenant's reasonable moving costs. The URA is not applicable in  this situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Where the PHA elects in the future to use public housing funds  for modernization of these units, the PHA must execute an ACC Amendment  with a 20-year use restriction and record a Declaration of Trust or  Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, in accordance with Sec. 905.304.  There may be no disposition of the public housing units without the  prior written approval of HUD during the 20-year period, and the public  housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all  applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as those  requirements may be amended from time to time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Capital Fund-Only Development. Capital Fund-Only projects refers  to mixed-finance projects where a PHA and its partners may develop  public housing units using public housing funds for development of new  units, but for which HUD will not be providing operating subsidy under  Section 9(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e). These types of projects are  subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The newly developed public housing units will not be included in  the calculation of the Operating Fund formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The PHA must sign an ACC Amendment, with a 40-year use  restriction, for development of new units and record a Declaration of  Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants in accordance with Sec.  905.304 of this part, unless the time period is reduced by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There shall be no disposition of the public housing units,  without the prior written approval of HUD, during a 40-year period, and  the public housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance  with all applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as  required by section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3), as  those requirements may be amended from time to time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedures. PHAs must follow the development approval process  identified in Sec. 905.600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Mixed-finance operations: Deviation from HUD requirements  pursuant to section 35(h) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437z-7(h). (1)  Deviation. If a PHA enters into a contract with an entity that owns or  operates a mixed-finance project, and the terms of the contract obligate  the entity to operate and maintain a specified number of units in the  project as public housing units, the contract may include terms that  allow the Owner Entity to deviate from otherwise applicable Public  Housing Requirements regarding rents, income eligibility, and other  areas of public housing management with respect to all or a portion of  the public housing units, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are a significant number of units in the mixed-finance  project that are not public housing units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a reduction in appropriations under Section 9(e) of  the 1937 Act (see 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e)) or a change in applicable law that  results in the PHA being unable to fulfill its contractual obligation to  the Owner Entity with respect to the public housing units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prior to implementation of the contractual terms related to  deviation from the Public Housing Requirements,   HUD approves an Alternative Management Plan for the mixed-finance  project; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The deviation shall be to the extent necessary to preserve the  viability of those units while maintaining the low-income character of  the units to the maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preparation of an Alternative Management Plan. Should the PHA  and the Owner Entity determine a need to deviate from the Public Housing  Requirements, the PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must submit an  Alternative Management Plan to HUD for review and approval prior to  implementation of any changes. The Plan must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement describing the Owner Entity's reasons for deviating  from the Public Housing Requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the Owner Entity's proposed remedies,  including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> How the Owner Entity will select the residents (including the  number and income levels of the families proposed to be admitted to the  public housing units) and units to be affected by the proposed change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Owner Entity's timetable for implementing the Alternative  Management Plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The impact on existing residents. Note that for any resident who  is unable to remain in the unit as a result of implementation of the  Alternative Management Plan, the resident must be relocated to a public  housing unit or given a Housing Choice Voucher by the PHA or by another  entity as provided for in the contractual agreement between the PHA and  the Owner Entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amendment to the existing contractual agreement between the  PHA and the Owner Entity that includes provisions which ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An update on the Alternative Management Plan is submitted  annually to HUD to ensure that implementation of the provisions of the  Alternative Management Plan continue to be appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Owner Entity complies with the requirements of this subpart  in its management and operation of the public housing units in  accordance with the Alternative Management Plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Owner Entity provides the PHA any income that is generated  by the public housing units in excess of the Owner Entity's expenses on  behalf of those units, as a result of implementation of provisions in  the Alternative Management Plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The Owner Entity reinstates all Public Housing Requirements  (including rent and income eligibility requirements) with respect to the  original number of public housing units and number of bedrooms in the  mixed-finance development, following the PHA's reinstatement of  operating subsidies at the level originally agreed to in its contract  with the Owner Entity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional evidence. The PHA must provide documentation that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Owner Entity has provided copies of the Alternative  Management Plan to residents of the project and provided the opportunity  for review and comment prior to submission to HUD. The Owner Entity must  have provided written notice to each of the public housing residents in  the mixed-finance development of its intention to implement the  Alternative Management Plan. Such notice must comply with all relevant  federal, state, and local substantive and procedural requirements and,  at a minimum, provide public housing residents 90 days advance notice of  any proposal to increase rents or to relocate public housing residents  to alternative housing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The revenues being generated by the public housing units (in  combination with the reduced allocation of Operating Subsidy resulting  primarily from a reduction in appropriations or changes in applicable  law such that the PHA is unable to comply with its contractual  obligations to the Owner Entity) are inadequate to cover the reasonable  and necessary operating expenses of the public housing units.  Documentation should include a financial statement showing actual  operating expenses and revenues over the past 5 years and the projected  expenses and revenues over the next 10 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A demonstration that the PHA cannot meet its contractual  obligation, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The Owner Entity has attempted to offset with regard to the  project, the   impact of reduced operating subsidies or changes in applicable law by  all available means; including the use of other public and private  development resources, the use of cash flow from any nonpublic housing  units, and funds from other operating deficient reserves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> HUD review. HUD will review the Alternative Management Plan to  ensure that the plan meets the requirements of this subpart and that any  proposed deviation from the Public Housing Requirements will be  implemented only to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of  the public housing units. Upon completion of HUD's review, HUD will  either approve or disapprove the Alternative Management Plan. Reasons  for HUD disapproval may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The justification for deviation from the Public Housing  Requirements does not qualify in accordance with section 35(h) of the  Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-7(h)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed deviation(s) from the Public Housing Requirements  are not limited to preserving the viability of the public housing units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The information that HUD requires to be included in the  Alternative Management Plan has not been included, is not accurate, or  does not support the need for deviation from the Public Housing  Requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> HUD has evidence that the proposed Alternative Management Plan  is not in compliance with other federal requirements, including civil  rights laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> HUD reevaluation and reapproval. The PHA, on behalf of the Owner  Entity, must provide to HUD, for HUD approval, an annual update on the  implementation of the Alternative Management Plan. The update must  provide the status of the project and whether the circumstances  originally triggering the need for the conditions contained in the  Alternative Management Plan remain valid and appropriate. Any proposed  changes in the Alternative Management Plan should also be identified.  Once the annual update of the Alternative Management Plan is properly  submitted, the existing Alternative Management Plan shall remain in  effect until such time as HUD takes additional action to approve or  disapprove the annual update.</p>
