                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in Sec. 648.78, the following cage identification  requirements apply to all vessels issued a Federal fishing permit for  surfclams and ocean quahogs:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tagging. Before offloading, all cages that contain surfclams or  ocean quahogs must be tagged with tags acquired annually under  provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. A tag must be fixed on or  as near as possible to the upper crossbar of the cage. A tag is required  for every 60 ft\3\ (1,700 L) of cage volume, or portion thereof. A tag  or tags must not be removed until the cage is emptied by the processor,  at which time the processor must promptly remove and retain the tag(s)  for 60 days beyond the end of the calendar year, unless otherwise  directed by authorized law enforcement agents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance. The Regional Administrator will issue a supply of tags  to each individual allocation owner qualifying for an allocation under  Sec. 648.74 prior to the beginning of each fishing year, or he/she may  specify, in the Federal Register, a vendor from whom the tags shall be  purchased. The number of tags will be based on the owner's initial  allocation as specified in Sec. 648.74(a). Each tag represents 32 bu  (1,700 L) of allocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Expiration. Tags will expire at the end of the fishing year for  which they are issued, or if rendered null and void in accordance with  15 CFR part 904.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Return. Tags that have been rendered null and void must be  returned to the Regional Administrator, if possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loss. Loss or theft of tags must be reported by the owner,  numerically identifying the tags to the Regional Administrator by  telephone as soon as the loss or theft is discovered and in writing  within 24 hours. Thereafter, the reported tags shall no longer be valid  for use under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Replacement. Lost or stolen tags may be replaced by the Regional  Administrator if proper notice of the loss is provided by the person to  whom the tags were issued. Replacement tags may be purchased from the  Regional Administrator or a vendor with a written authorization from the  Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer. See Sec. 648.74(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Presumptions. Surfclams and ocean quahogs found in cages without  a valid state tag are deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ and to be  part of an individual's allocation, unless the individual demonstrates  that he/she has surrendered his/her Federal vessel permit issued under  Sec. 648.4(a)(4) and conducted fishing operations exclusively within  waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surfclams and ocean quahogs  in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and still valid pursuant to  this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have been harvested by the  individual allocation holder to whom the tags were issued under the  provisions of Sec. 648.77(b) or transferred under the provisions of  Sec. 648.74(b).
