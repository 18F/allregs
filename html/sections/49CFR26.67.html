                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Presumption of disadvantage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must rebuttably presume  that citizens of the United States (or lawfully admitted permanent  residents) who are women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native  Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or  other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the SBA, are socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals. You must require applicants to  submit a signed, notarized certification that each presumptively  disadvantaged owner is, in fact, socially and economically  disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must require each individual owner of a firm applying to  participate as a DBE, whose ownership and control are relied upon for  DBE certification, to certify that he or she has a personal net worth  that does not exceed $1.32 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must require each individual who makes this certification  to support it with a signed, notarized statement of personal net worth,  with appropriate supporting documentation. To meet this requirement, you  must use the DOT personal net worth form provided in appendix G to this  part without change or revision. Where necessary to accurately determine  an individual's personal net worth, you may, on a case-by-case basis,  require additional financial information from the owner of an applicant  firm (e.g., information concerning the assets of the owner's spouse,  where needed to clarify whether assets have been transferred to the  spouse or when the owner's spouse is involved in the operation of the  company). Requests for additional information shall not be unduly  burdensome or intrusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining an individual's net worth, you must observe the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exclude an individual's ownership interest in the applicant  firm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exclude the individual's equity in his or her primary residence  (except any portion of such equity that is attributable to excessive  withdrawals from the applicant firm). The equity is the market value of  the residence less any mortgages and home equity loan balances.  Recipients must ensure that home equity loan balances are included in  the equity calculation and not as a separate liability on the  individual's personal net worth form. Exclusions for net worth purposes  are not exclusions for asset valuation or access to capital and credit  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Do not use a contingent liability to reduce an individual's net  worth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> With respect to assets held in vested pension plans, Individual  Retirement Accounts, 401(k) accounts, or other retirement savings or  investment programs in which the assets cannot be distributed to the  individual at the present time without significant adverse tax or  interest consequences, include only the present value of such assets,  less the tax and interest penalties that would accrue if the asset were  distributed at the present time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of Federal or State law, you must  not release an individual's personal net worth statement nor any  documents pertaining to it to any third party without the written  consent of the submitter. Provided, that you must transmit this  information to DOT in any certification appeal proceeding under Sec.  26.89 of this part or to any other State to which the individual's firm  has applied for certification under Sec. 26.85 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rebuttal of presumption of disadvantage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual's  presumption of economic disadvantage may be rebutted in two ways.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the statement of personal net worth and supporting  documentation that an individual submits under paragraph (a)(2) of this  section shows that the individual's personal net worth exceeds $1.32  million, the individual's presumption of economic disadvantage is  rebutted. You are not required to have a proceeding under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section in order to rebut the presumption of economic  disadvantage in this case.</p><p class="depth0">Example to paragraph (b)(1)(i): An individual with very high assets  and significant liabilities may, in accounting terms, have a PNW of less  than $1.32 million. However, the person's assets collectively (e.g.,  high income level, a very expensive house, a yacht, extensive real or  personal property holdings) may lead a reasonable person to conclude  that he or she is not economically disadvantaged. The recipient may  rebut the individual's presumption of economic disadvantage under these  circumstances, as provided in this section, even though the individual's  PNW is less than $1.32 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the statement of personal net worth and supporting  documentation that an individual submits under paragraph (a)(2) of this  section demonstrates that the individual is able to accumulate  substantial wealth, the individual's presumption of economic  disadvantage is rebutted. In making this determination, as a certifying  agency, you may consider factors that include, but are not limited to,  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the average adjusted gross income of the owner over the  most recent three year period exceeds $350,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the income was unusual and not likely to occur in the  future;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the earnings were offset by losses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether the income was reinvested in the firm or used to pay  taxes arising in the normal course of operations by the firm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other evidence that income is not indicative of lack of economic  disadvantage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Whether the total fair market value of the owner's assets exceed  $6 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must have a proceeding under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section in order to rebut the presumption of economic disadvantage in  this case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you have a reasonable basis to believe that an individual who  is a member of one of the designated groups is not, in fact, socially  and/or economically disadvantaged you may, at any time, start a  proceeding to determine whether the presumption should be regarded as  rebutted with respect to that individual. Your proceeding must follow  the procedures of Sec. 26.87.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In such a proceeding, you have the burden of demonstrating, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that the individual is not socially and  economically disadvantaged. You may require the individual to produce  information relevant to the determination of his or her disadvantage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When an individual's presumption of social and/or economic  disadvantage has been rebutted, his or her ownership and control of the  firm in question cannot be used for purposes of DBE eligibility under  this subpart unless and until he or she makes an individual showing of  social and/or economic disadvantage. If the basis for rebutting the  presumption is a determination that the individual's personal net   worth exceeds $1.32 million, the individual is no longer eligible for  participation in the program and cannot regain eligibility by making an  individual showing of disadvantage, so long as his or her PNW remains  above that amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfers within two years. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as set forth in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, recipients must attribute to an individual  claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has  transferred to an immediate family member, to a trust a beneficiary of  which is an immediate family member, or to the applicant firm for less  than fair market value, within two years prior to a concern's  application for participation in the DBE program or within two years of  recipient's review of the firm's annual affidavit, unless the individual  claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that the transfer is to or  on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education,  medical expenses, or some other form of essential support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recipients must not attribute to an individual claiming  disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an  immediate family member that are consistent with the customary  recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations,  anniversaries, and retirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Individual determinations of social and economic disadvantage.  Firms owned and controlled by individuals who are not presumed to be  socially and economically disadvantaged (including individuals whose  presumed disadvantage has been rebutted) may apply for DBE  certification. You must make a case-by-case determination of whether  each individual whose ownership and control are relied upon for DBE  certification is socially and economically disadvantaged. In such a  proceeding, the applicant firm has the burden of demonstrating to you,  by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and  control it are socially and economically disadvantaged. An individual  whose personal net worth exceeds $1.32 million shall not be deemed to be  economically disadvantaged. In making these determinations, use the  guidance found in Appendix E of this part. You must require that  applicants provide sufficient information to permit determinations under  the guidance of appendix E of this part.  [79 FR 59596, Oct. 2, 2014]</p>
