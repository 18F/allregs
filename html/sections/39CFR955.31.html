In  any such case where the suspension has continued, or it appears that it  will continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its  discretion, dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to  their restoration when the cause of suspension has been removed. Unless  either party or the Board acts within three years to reinstate any  appeal dismissed without prejudice, the dismissal shall be deemed with  prejudice.</p>
