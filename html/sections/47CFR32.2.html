                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in  monetary terms, the basic transactions which occur. Certain natural  groupings of these transactions are called (in different contexts)  transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The  concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings  represent what happens within the company on a consistent and continuing  basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over long  periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account  structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within the telecommunications industry companies, certain  recurring functions (natural groupings) do take place in the course of  providing products and services to customers. These accounts reflect, to  the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of  the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are  the functions performed by the assets. In addition, because of the  anticipated effects of future innovations, the telecommunications plant  accounts are intended to permit technological distinctions. Similarly,  the primary bases of plant operations, customer operations and corporate  operations expense accounts are the functions performed by individuals.  The revenue accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of  natural groupings based primarily upon the products and services  purchased by customers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and (d) of subpart  B.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not  be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location,  description or size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Care has been taken in this account structure to avoid confusing  a function with an organizational responsibility, particularly as it  relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in the past, specific  organizations may have performed specific functions, the future  environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will  result in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any  relationships drawn between organizations and accounts would become  increasingly meaningless with the passage of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> These accounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and  technological view of the telecommunications industry. This view will  provide a stable and consistent foundation for the recording of  financial data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The financial data contained in the accounts, together with the  detailed information contained in the underlying financial and other  subsidiary records required by this Commission, will provide the  information necessary to support separations, cost of service and  management reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been  designed to remain stable as reporting requirements change.</p>
