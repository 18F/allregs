                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you elect the TDS limit for quench water in Sec. 63.7295(a)(1)(i), you must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source according to the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take the quench water sample from a location that provides a representative sample of the quench water as applied to the coke (e.g., from the header that feeds water to the quench tower reservoirs). Conduct sampling under normal and representative operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the TDS concentration of the sample using Method 160.1 in 40 CFR part 136.3 (see ``residue--filterable''), except that you must dry the total filterable residue at 103 to 105 C (degrees Centigrade) instead of 180 C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If at any time you elect to meet the alternative requirements for quench water in Sec. 63.7295(a)(1)(ii), you must establish a site-specific constituent limit according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take a minimum of nine quench water samples from a location that provides a representative sample of the quench water as applied to the coke (e.g., from the header that feeds water to the quench tower reservoirs). Conduct sampling under normal and representative operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each sample, determine the TDS concentration according to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the concentration of benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene using the applicable methods in 40 CFR part 136 or an approved alternative method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine and record the highest sum of the concentrations of benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene in any sample that has a TDS concentration less than or equal to the TDS limit of 1,100 mg/L. This concentration is the site-specific constituent limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit the site-specific limit, sampling results, and all supporting data and calculations to your permitting authority for review and approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you elect the constituent limit for quench water in Sec. 63.7295(a)(1)(ii), you must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source according to the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take a quench water sample from a location that provides a representative sample of the quench water as applied to the coke (e.g., from the header that feeds water to the quench tower reservoirs).
