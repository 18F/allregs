                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statements shall not be issued for applications in the following  areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Local requirements. Applications for statements for additions,  alterations, or methods of operation that result from requirements  imposed by municipalities, counties or other forms of local or regional  authorities and governments, except for areawide management agencies  designated and approved under section 208 of the Act, shall not be  approved; except for those requirements resulting from the application  of pretreatment requirements under section 307(b) of the Act; or those  resulting from an approved project for facilities plans, and developed  under section 201 of the Act. (See 35 CFR, subpart E); or under a  delegation of authority under the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act (see 35 CFR 925-11 and 925-12) shall  not be approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New facility sewer construction. Applications for statements  involving projects that involve the construction of a lateral,  collection, or interceptor sewer, at a facility that was not in  existence on October 18, 1972, shall not be approved. Applications for  additions, alterations, or methods of operation for new facilities that  do not involve sewer construction are not affected by this preclusion.  Further, if an applicant is compelled to move as a result of a  relocation requirement but operated at the facility prior to October 18,  1972, the cost of construction for a lateral, collection, or interceptor  sewer can be approved for the new, relocated site. For the purpose of  this exclusion lateral, collection, or interceptor sewer is determined  as any sewer transporting waste from a facility or site to any publicly  owned sewer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other non-water related pollution abatement additions,  alterations, or methods of operation which are not integral to meeting  the requirements of the Act, although they may be achieving the  requirements of another Federal or State law or regulation.</p><p class="depth3">Comment: An example would be where stack emission controls were  required on equipment that operated the water pollution control  facility. This emission control equipment as an integral part of the  water pollution control systems would be approvable. However, emission  control equipment for a general purpose incinerator that only  incidentally burned sewage sludge would not be approvable. The general  purpose incinerator might also receive loan assistance but under  separate procedures than those set out for water pollution control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Privately owned treatment facility service or user costs.  Applications for statements involving financial assistance in meeting  user cost or fee schedules related to participating in a privately owned  treatment facility not under the ownership or control of the applicant  shall not be approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Operation and maintenance charges. Applications for statements  containing a request for financial assistance in meeting the operations  and maintenance costs of operating the applicant's additions,  alterations, or methods of operation shall not be approved for any  elements relating to such areas of cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Evidence of financial responsibility. Applications for  statements containing a request for financial assistance in meeting any  requirements relating to evidence of financial responsibility as  provided in section 311(p) of the Act shall not be approved.    Sec. 21.7  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3">Comment: Applications for a statement resulting from a requirement  to control pollution from non-point sources as identified in section  304(e)(2)(A-F) of the Act and described in Sec. 21.2(m) will not  presently be issued a statement under Sec. 21.5 unless the requirement  is established through a permit under section 402. There is no  requirement under the current Act that the Federal Government control  pollution from such sources, and the nature and scope of State or  areawide management agency proposals or   programs to control such sources cannot be determined at this time. As  State and areawide plans for control of nonpoint sources being prepared  under section 208 of the Act, will not be completed for several years,  this section is being reserved pending a future determination on the  eligibility of applications relating to non-profit sources to receive a  statement under this part.</p>
