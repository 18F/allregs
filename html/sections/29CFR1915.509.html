The method requires that the burning  torch is installed to one end of the oxygen and fuel gas lines and then  the gauges are attached to the other end of the hoses. The manifold or  cylinder supply valve is opened and the system is pressurized. The  manifold or cylinder supply valve is then closed and the gauges are  watched for at least sixty (60) seconds. Any drop in pressure indicates  a leak.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency operations--activities performed by fire response  organizations that are related to: rescue, fire suppression, emergency  medical care, and special operations or activities that include  responding to the scene of an incident and all activities performed at  that scene.</p><p class="depth0">Fire hazard--a condition or material that may start or contribute to  the spread of fire.</p><p class="depth0">Fire protection--methods of providing fire prevention, response,  detection, control, extinguishment, and engineering.</p><p class="depth0">Fire response--the activity taken by the employer at the time of an  emergency incident involving a fire at the worksite, including fire  suppression activities carried out by internal or external resources or  a combination of both, or total or partial employee evacuation of the  area exposed to the fire.</p><p class="depth0">Fire response employee--a shipyard employee who carries out the  duties and responsibilities of shipyard firefighting in accordance with  the fire safety plan.</p><p class="depth0">Fire response organization--an organized group knowledgeable,  trained, and skilled in shipyard firefighting operations that responds  to shipyard fire emergencies, including: fire brigades, shipyard fire  departments, private or contractual fire departments, and municipal fire  departments.</p><p class="depth0">Fire suppression--the activities involved in controlling and  extinguishing fires.</p><p class="depth0">Fire watch--the activity of observing and responding to the fire  hazards associated with hot work in shipyard employment and the  employees designated to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed extinguishing system--a permanently installed fire protection  system that either extinguishes or controls fire occurring in the space  it protects.</p><p class="depth0">Flammable liquid--any liquid having a flashpoint below 100 [deg]F  (37.8 [deg]C), except any mixture having components with flashpoints of  100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C) or higher, the total of which make up 99  percent or more of the total volume of the mixture.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous substance--a substance likely to cause injury by reason of  being explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, oxidizing, an  irritant, or otherwise harmful.</p><p class="depth0">Hose systems--fire protection systems consisting of a water supply,  approved fire hose, and a means to control the flow of water at the  output end of the hose.</p><p class="depth0">Host employer--an employer who is in charge of coordinating work or  who hires other employers to perform work at a multi-employer workplace.</p><p class="depth0">Incident management system--a system that defines the roles and  responsibilities to be assumed by personnel and   the operating procedures to be used in the management and direction of  emergency operations; the system is also referred to as an ``incident  command system'' (ICS).</p><p class="depth0">Incipient stage fire--a fire, in the initial or beginning stage,  which can be controlled or extinguished by portable fire extinguishers,  Class II standpipe or small hose systems without the need for protective  clothing or breathing apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">Inerting--the displacement of the atmosphere in a permit space by  noncombustible gas (such as nitrogen) to such an extent that the  resulting atmosphere is noncombustible. This procedure produces an IDLH  oxygen-deficient atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Interior structural firefighting operations--the physical activity  of fire response, rescue, or both involving a fire beyond the incipient  stage inside of buildings, enclosed structures, vessels, and vessel  sections.</p><p class="depth0">Multi-employer workplace--a workplace where there is a host employer  and at least one contract employer.</p><p class="depth0">Personal Alert Safety System (PASS)--a device that sounds a loud  signal if the wearer becomes immobilized or is motionless for 30 seconds  or more.</p><p class="depth0">Physical isolation--the elimination of a fire hazard by removing the  hazard from the work area (at least 35 feet for combustibles), by  covering or shielding the hazard with a fire-resistant material, or  physically preventing the hazard from entering the work area.</p><p class="depth0">Physically isolated--positive isolation of the supply from the  distribution piping of a fixed extinguishing system. Examples of ways to  physically isolate include: removing a spool piece and installing a  blank flange; providing a double block and bleed valve system; or  completely disconnecting valves and piping from all cylinders or other  pressure vessels containing extinguishing agents.</p><p class="depth0">Protected space--any space into which a fixed extinguishing system  can discharge.</p><p class="depth0">Proximity firefighting--specialized fire-fighting operations that  require specialized thermal protection and may include the activities of  rescue, fire suppression, and property conservation at incidents  involving fires producing very high levels of conductive, convective,  and radiant heat such as aircraft fires, bulk flammable gas fires, and  bulk flammable liquid fires.
