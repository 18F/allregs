                            <p class="depth0">Each contract market shall adopt rules which shall, at a minimum, with respect to each member of the contract market acting as a floor broker:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibit such member from purchasing any commodity for future delivery, purchasing any call option, or selling any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he

has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) purchase of any future, (2) purchase of any call option, or (3) sale of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such purchase or sale can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibit such member from selling any commodity for future delivery, selling any call option, or purchasing any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) sale of any future, (2) sale of any call option, or (3) purchase of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such sale or purchase can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibit such member from executing any transaction for any account of another person for which buying and/or selling orders can be placed or originated, or for which transactions can be executed, by such member without the prior specific consent of the account owner, regardless of whether the general authorization for such orders or transactions is pursuant to a written agreement, except that orders for such an account may be placed with another member for execution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibit such member from disclosing at any time that he is holding an order of another person or from divulging any order revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or at the request of an authorized representative of the Commission or the contract market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibit such member from taking, directly or indirectly, the other side of any order of another person revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except with such other person's prior consent and in conformity with contract market rules approved by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prohibit such member from making any purchase or sale which has been directly or indirectly prearranged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Prohibit such member from allocating trades among accounts except in accordance with rules of the contract market which have been approved by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prohibit such member from withholding or withdrawing from the market any order or part of an order of another person for the convenience of another member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Require that every execution of a transaction on the floor by such member be confirmed promptly with the opposite floor broker or floor trader; such confirmation shall identify price or premium, quantity, future or commodity option and respective clearing members. In the event a contract market cannot require prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, the contract market may petition the Commission for exemption from this requirement. Such petition shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> An explanation of why the contract market cannot require the prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> A proposed contract market rule which will insure that the opposite sides of every trade executed on the contract market can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.
The Commission may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, grant such petition for exemption upon finding that the functions of the contract market may be seriously disrupted by requiring the prompt identification of respective clearing members and that the contract market appears to have adequately insured that every trade executed thereon can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a

clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.
