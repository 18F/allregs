HUD will grant funds to recipients to pay a portion of the  cost of new construction, including cost-effective energy measures and  the cost of land associated with that construction, for use in the  provision of supportive housing. If the grant funds are used for new  construction, the applicant must demonstrate that the costs associated  with new construction are substantially less than the costs associated  with rehabilitation or that there is a lack of available appropriate  units that could be rehabilitated at a cost less than new construction.  For purposes of this cost comparison, costs associated with  rehabilitation or new construction may include the cost of real property  acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount. The maximum grant available for new construction is the  lower of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> $400,000; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total cost of the new construction, including the cost of  land associated with that construction, minus the applicant's  contribution toward the cost of same.</p>
