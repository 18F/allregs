                                Sec.  100.2  Average cost of a health insurance policy.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of determining the amount of compensation under the  VICP, section 2115(a)(3)(B) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-15(a)(3)(B),  provides that certain individuals are entitled to receive an amount  reflecting lost earnings, less certain deductions. One of the deductions  is the average cost of a health insurance policy, as determined by the  Secretary. The Secretary has determined that the average cost of a  health insurance policy is $363.12 for 2006. This figure is calculated  periodically (generally on an annual basis) using the most recent  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data  available as the baseline for the average monthly cost of a health  insurance policy. This baseline is adjusted by the annual percentage  increase/decrease obtained from the most recent annual Kaiser Family  Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust (KFF/HRET) Employer  Health Benefits survey or other authoritative source that may be more  accurate or appropriate in the future. The revised amount will be  effective upon its delivery by the Secretary to the United States Court  of Federal Claims, and the amount will be published as a notice in the  Federal Register periodically (generally on an annual basis).
