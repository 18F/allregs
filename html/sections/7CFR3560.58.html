Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage removal, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, may not be acceptable. Consistent with Federal law and Departmental Regulation, the Agency must conduct an environmental assessment and a civil rights impact analysis before a site can be accepted. Sites may be determined by the Agency to be unacceptable if any of the adverse conditions described in this paragraph exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Structures located in central business areas. The Agency will consider financing construction or the purchase and substantial rehabilitation of an existing structure located in the central business area of a rural community. With prior consent from the Agency, a portion of such a structure may be designated for commercial use on a lease basis. RHS funds may not be used to finance any cost associated with the commercial space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Site development costs and standards.
