                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. UnlessSec. 311.6 is applicable, the procedures for closing meetings will be those set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. (1) A decision to close a meeting or portion of a meeting will be taken only when a majority of the entire Board votes to take such action. In deciding whether to close a meeting or portion of a meeting, the Board will consider whether the public interest requires an open meeting. A separate vote of the Board will be taken with respect to each meeting which is proposed to be closed in whole or in part to the public. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings which are proposed to be closed in whole or in part to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in the series. The

vote of each Board member will be recorded and no proxies will be allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A decision to close a meeting or portion of a meeting will be taken only when a majority of the entire Board votes to take such action.

Requests should be directed to the Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429. After receiving notice that an individual desires a portion of a meeting to be closed, the Board, upon request of any one of its members, will vote by recorded vote whether to close the relevant portion of the meeting. This procedure will apply even if the individual's request is made subsequent to the announcement of a decision to hold an open meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Corporation's General Counsel will make the public certification required by Sec. 311.7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 1 day after any vote taken pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the Corporation will make publicly available a written copy of the vote, reflecting the vote of each Board member. Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure, if a meeting or portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Corporation will make publicly available within 1 day after the required vote a full written explanation of its action, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Corporation will publicly announce the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, with determinations as to open and closed portions, in the manner and within the time limits prescribed in Sec. 311.4.
