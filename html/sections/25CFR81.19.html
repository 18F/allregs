                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nonresident members who have registered may vote by absentee ballot except as prohibited by Sec. 81.6. Also, whenever, due to temporary absence from the reservation, illness, or physical disability, a registered and otherwise eligible voter is not able to vote at the polls and notifies the election board, the voter shall be entitled to vote by absentee ballot. Upon his or her request, the election board shall give or mail absentee ballots to registered voters who may be entitled to receive them pursuant to Sec. 81.6. At the same time, such voters will also be provided a copy of the proposal to be voted upon when the full text does not appear on the ballot. Appropriate records shall be kept of those from whom requests are received and the date they were received. The election board shall allow an absentee voter no less than ten days from the mailing out of an absentee ballot to receive and return the ballot. This period shall not be afforded absentee voters desiring to exchange a mutilated or spoiled ballot less than ten days before the election date. While requests for absentee ballots received less than ten days before an election will be promptly honored, no absentee ballot will be counted if received later than either the close of the polls or after some other deadline established by the election board. The election board shall furnish election officials the names of individuals who have been given or had mailed to them an absentee ballot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accompanying the absentee ballot shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An inner envelope bearing on the outside, the words ``Absentee Ballot,''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instructions for completion of the absentee ballot,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the proposed amendment, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A preaddressed outer envelope, imprinted on the back with a certificate as follows:</p><p class="depth3">I, (name of voter), hereby certify that I am a qualified voter of the (name) Tribe of Indians; that I will be 18 years of age or over at the election date and am entitled to vote in the election to be held on (date of election); and that I cannot appear at the polling place on the reservation on the date of the election because (indicate one of the following reasons): I am a non resident voter [squ]; or I expect to be temporarily absent from the reservation [squ]; or because of illness [squ]; or physical disability [squ]; or because no polling place has been established [squ]. I further certify that I marked the enclosed ballot in secret.</p><p class="depth3">Signed:--------------(voter's signature).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The absentee voter shall mark the ballot and the ballot shall then be folded so as to conceal the marking and be placed in the envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' and the envelope sealed. The voter shall then place the sealed envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' in the outer envelope, seal it and complete the certificate and mail it. The preaddressed outer envelope shall be directed to the election board at the reservation. Absentee ballots must be received by the election board not later

than the close of the polls or as otherwise directed by the election board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The election board shall make and keep a record of ballots mailed, to whom mailed, the date of mailing, the address on the envelope, the date of the return of the ballot, and from whom received. After duly recording the receipt date of absentee ballots received on time, representatives of the election board shall open the outer envelopes, secure them and place the unmarked inner envelopes containing the ballots in a separate box reserved for that purpose. After all other ballots have been counted, the absentee ballots shall be counted immediately and included in the results of the election.</p>
