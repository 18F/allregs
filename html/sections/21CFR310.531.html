                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aminacrine hydrochloride, benzocaine, bismuth subnitrate,  calomel, camphor, cholesterol, ergot fluid extract, hexachlorophene,  ichthammol, isobutamben, juniper tar (oil of cade), lanolin, magnesium  sulfate, menthol, methyl salicylate, oxyguinoline sulfate, petrolatum,  phenol, pine tar, rosin, rosin cerate, sassafras oil, sulfur, thymol,  triclosan, and zinc oxide have been present in OTC boil treatment drug  products. There is a lack of adequate data to establish general  recognition of the safety and effectiveness of these or any other  ingredient for OTC use for the treatment of boils. Treatment is defined  as reducing the size of a boil or reducing an infection related to a  boil. Treatment has involved the use of ``drawing salves'' for these  purposes. These ``drawing salves'' contained various ingredients. Based  on evidence currently available, any OTC drug product offered for the  treatment of boils cannot be considered generally recognized as safe and  effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted  for the treatment of boils is regarded as a new drug within the meaning  of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),  for which an approved application or abbreviated application under  section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for  marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or  abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under  section 502 of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any OTC  boil treatment drug product is safe and effective for the purpose  intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the  use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After May 7, 1991, any such OTC drug product that contains  aminacrine hydrochloride, bismuth subnitrate, calomel, camphor,  cholesterol, ergot fluid extract, hexachlorophene, isobutamben, juniper  tar (oil of cade), lanolin, magnesium sulfate, menthol, methyl  salicylate, oxyguinoline sulfate, petrolatum, phenol, pine tar, rosin,  rosin cerate, sassafras oil, thymol, or zinc oxide initially introduced  or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is  not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After May 16, 1994, any such OTC drug product that contains  benzocaine, ichthammol, sulfur, or triclosan initially introduced or  initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is  not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This section does not apply to drug products that contain  benzocaine labeled, represented, or promoted for OTC topical use in  accordance with part 348 of this chapter.
