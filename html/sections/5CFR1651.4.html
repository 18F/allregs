                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Change. To change a designation of beneficiary, the participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a new TSP designation of beneficiary form meeting the requirements of Sec. 1651.3 to the TSP record keeper. If the TSP receives more than one valid TSP designation of beneficiary form, it will honor the form with the latest date signed by the participant. A participant may change a TSP beneficiary at any time, without the knowledge or consent of any person, including his or her spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cancellation. A participant may cancel all prior designations of beneficiaries by sending the TSP record keeper either a new valid designation of beneficiary form meeting the requirements of Sec. 1651.3, or a letter. If the participant uses a letter to cancel a designation of beneficiary, it must be signed and witnessed in the same manner as a TSP designation of beneficiary form; it must explicitly state that all prior designations are canceled; and the TSP record keeper must receive it on or before the date of the participant's death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Will. A participant cannot use a will to change or cancel a TSP designation of beneficiary.
