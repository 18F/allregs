                            <p class="depth0">Financial hardship may be deemed to exist when the debtor needs  substantially all of his or her current and anticipated income and  liquid assets to meet current and anticipated ordinary and necessary  living expenses during the projected period of collection. Financial  hardship will not be found to exist when the debtor merely establishes  that the repayment causes a financial burden, i.e., when it is  inconvenient to repay the debt. If there are anticipated changes in  income or expenses that would allow for the recovery of the overpayment  at a later date, the Department may suspend collection action until a  future date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Considerations. Pertinent considerations in determining whether  recovery would cause financial hardship include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor's financial ability to pay at the time collection is  scheduled to be made, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and  necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the  debtor.</p>
