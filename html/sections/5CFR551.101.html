                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (referred to as  ``the Act'' or ``FLSA''), provides minimum standards for both wages and  overtime entitlements, and administrative procedures by which covered  worktime must be compensated. Included in the Act are provisions related  to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-portal activities. In addition,  the Act exempts specified employees or groups of employees from the  application of certain of its provisions and prescribes penalties for  the commission of specifically prohibited acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part contains the regulations, criteria, and conditions set  forth by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as prescribed by the  Act, supplements and implements the Act, and must be read in conjunction  with it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OPM's administration of the Act must comply with the terms of  the Act but the law does not require OPM's regulations to mirror the  Department of Labor's FLSA regulations. OPM's administration of the Act  must be consistent with the Department of Labor's administration of the  Act only to the extent practicable and only to the extent that this  consistency is required to maintain compliance with the terms of the  Act. For example, while OPM's executive, administrative, and  professional exemption criteria are consistent with the Department of  Labor's exemption criteria, OPM does not apply the highly compensated  employee criteria in 29 CFR 541.601 to determine FLSA exemption status.</p>
