However, if the property is purchased at the sale by the holder, the indebtedness will be credited with the net proceeds of the sale or an amount established in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The holder shall notify the Secretary of the results of the sale within 10 days after the sale is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event that any real property which is security for a guaranteed loan is to be acquired by a holder in a manner other than as provided in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section (e.g., by strict foreclosure or by the termination without a public sale of the purchaser's interest in a land sale contract), the holder shall notify the Secretary of the acquisition within 15 days

thereafter and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When a debtor proposes to convey or transfer any property to a holder to avoid foreclosure or other judicial, contractual, or statutory disposition of the obligation or of the security, the consent of the Secretary to the terms of such proposal shall be obtained in advance of such conveyance or transfer. If the Secretary consents thereto, the holder may acquire the property and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If a minimum bid is required under applicable State law, or decree of foreclosure or order of sale, or other lawful order or decree, the holder may bid an amount not exceeding such amount legally required.

Also, if the holder acquires or repossesses the property and the holder learns of any material damage to it, the holder shall promptly advise the Secretary of such damage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> When the security for a guaranteed loan is acquired by the holder through foreclosure or otherwise, the holder shall resell the property within a reasonable time and may thereafter submit its claim under the guaranty. The Secretary, upon receipt of a notice of acquisition, shall determine the current reasonable value of the property and advise the holder of the minimum selling price that will be acceptable in any accounting with the Secretary upon liquidation of the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the holder resells the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price, it shall credit the indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the holder is unable to resell the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price after exposure to the market for a reasonable period of time, the holder may submit to the Secretary a written advice setting forth the price, terms, conditions and expenses of any offer received.

pro rata with any increase or decrease in the balance of the loan obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Secretary shall execute an indemnity agreement evidencing the amount and terms of the indemnity liability, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Secretary has determined that resale of the security under an indemnity agreement is in the best interest of the Government, and the holder has obtained the prior approval of the Secretary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms of repayment of the proposed loan bear a proper relationship to the borrower's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The borrower executes an agreement establishing liability to the Secretary for the amount of any claim paid under the indemnity agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The term of the proposed loan does not exceed the maximum term allowable under Sec. 36.4204(c)(4);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The interest rate charged the borrower does not exceed the maximum rate allowable under Sec. 36.4212 as of the date of closing pursuant to the indemnity agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The holder agrees to comply with VA manufactured home regulations as if the original loan had not been terminated.

Further:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The minimum selling price determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If no minimum selling price is provided then the current reasonable value of the property as determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; and</p><p class="depth0">The amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allowable post-acquisition expenditures or costs paid by the holder which may be included in the accounting with the Secretary are limited to those specified in Sec. 36.4276(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If at the end of 6 months from the date of acquisition the holder has been unable to resell the property and no claim has been filed pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, a claim may be submitted under the guaranty and the Secretary will pay to the holder upon submission of such claim:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The difference between the appraised value of the property as determined by the Secretary and the indebtedness including those costs allowable under Sec. 36.4276 and the costs of repossessing the manufactured home not to exceed $100, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable cutoff date as set forth in Sec. 36.4284(a) at the maximum rate allowable.
