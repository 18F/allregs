These persons include  individuals and entities listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315,  as well as persons subsequently designated pursuant to criteria set  forth   in the order. OFAC includes the names of persons designated pursuant to  E.O. 13315 in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V, which lists persons  subject to various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. All persons  designated in or pursuant to E.O. 13315 are identified in Appendix A by  the bracketed initials [IRAQ2].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A license requirement applies to the  export, reexport, or transfer of any item subject to the EAR to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13315 of August 28, 2003; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Persons determined to be subject to E.O. 13315.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To avoid duplication, U.S. persons are not required to seek  separate BIS authorization for an export, reexport, or transfer to a  person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject  to both the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC. Therefore, if OFAC  authorizes an export from the United States or an export, reexport, or  transfer by a U.S. person to a person identified in paragraph (a) of  this section, no separate authorization from BIS is necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export,  reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this  section of any item subject to the EAR but not subject to regulations  maintained by OFAC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export  from abroad, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph  (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in  paragraph (a) of this section by a U.S. person of any item subject both  to the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC and not authorized by OFAC  is a violation of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any export, reexport, or transfer by a U.S. person to a person  identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the  EAR that is not subject to regulations maintained by OFAC and not  authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.
