                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decision-making. The Regional Administrator shall ensure that decisions are made in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Act and that the NEPA process is integrated into the decision-making process. Because of the diversity of FEMA, it is not feasible to describe in this part the decision-making process for each of the various FEMA programs. Proposals and actions may be initiated at any level. Similarly, review and approval authority may be exercised at various levels depending on the nature of the action, available funding, and statutory authority. FEMA offices and administrations shall provide further guidance, commensurate with their programs and organization, for integration of environmental considerations into the decision-making process. The Regional Administrator shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for Agency action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make all relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses part of the record in formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the proposal through existing Agency review processes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating proposals for Agency action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Record of decision. In those cases requiring environmental impact statements, the Regional Administrator at the time of his/her decision, or if appropriate, his/her recommendation to Congress, shall prepare a concise public record of that decision. The record of decision is not intended to be an extensive, detailed document for the purpose of justifying the decision. Rather it is a concise document that sets forth the decision and describes the alternatives and relevant factors considered as specified in 40 CFR 1505.2. The record of decision will normally be less than three pages in length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mitigation. Throughout the NEPA process, the Regional Administrator shall consider mitigating measures to avoid or minimize environmental harm and, in particular, harm to or within flood plains and wetlands. Mitigation measures or programs will be identified in the environmental impact statement and made available to decision-makers. Mitigation and other conditions established in the environmental impact statement or during its review and committed as part of the decision shall be implemented by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring. If a Regional Administrator determines that monitoring is applicable for established mitigation, a monitoring program will be adopted to assure the mitigation measures are accomplished. The Regional Administrator shall provide monitoring information, upon request, as specified in 40 CFR 1505.3. This does not, however, include standing or blanket requests for periodic reporting.</p>
