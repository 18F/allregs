                                Sec. 408.903  How do we determine the amount of an underpayment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The amount of an underpayment or overpayment is the difference between the amount you are paid and the amount you are due for a given period. An underpayment or overpayment period begins with the first month for which there is a difference between the amount paid and the amount actually due for that month. The period ends with the month in which we make the initial determination of the overpayment or underpayment. With respect to the period established, there can be no underpayment to you if we paid you more than the correct amount of SVB, even though we waived recovery of any overpayment to you for that period under the provisions of Secs. 408.910 through 408.914. A later initial determination of an overpayment will require no change with respect to a prior determination of overpayment or to the period relating to such prior determination to the extent that the basis of the prior overpayment remains the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limited delay in payment of an underpayment. Where we have detected a potential overpayment but we have not made a determination of the overpayment (see Sec. 408.918(a)), we will not delay making a determination of underpayment and paying you unless we can make an overpayment determination before the close of the month following the month in which we discovered the potential underpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delay in payment of underpayment to ineligible individual. If you are no longer entitled to SVB, we will delay a determination and payment of an underpayment that is otherwise due you so that we can resolve all overpayments, incorrect payments, and adjustments.</p>
