In order to be approved by the Secretary of  Education, a transition plan shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State the name, address, and Federal Interagency Committee on  Education Code of the educational institution submitting such plan, the  administratively separate units to which the plan is applicable, and the  name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom questions  concerning the plan may be addressed. The person who submits the plan  shall be the chief administrator or president of the institution, or  another individual legally authorized to bind the institution to all  actions set forth in the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State whether the educational institution or administratively  separate unit admits students of both sexes as regular students and, if  so, when it began to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify and describe with respect to the educational  institution or administratively separate unit any obstacles to admitting  students without discrimination on the basis of sex.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe in detail the steps necessary to eliminate as soon as  practicable each obstacle so identified and indicate the schedule for  taking these steps and the individual directly responsible for their  implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include estimates of the number of students, by sex, expected to  apply for, be admitted to, and enter each class during the period  covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nondiscrimination. No policy or practice of a recipient to which  Sec. 36.225 applies shall result in treatment of applicants to or  students of such recipient in violation of Sec.

To overcome the effects of past  exclusion of students on the basis of sex, each educational institution  to which Sec. 36.225 applies shall include in its transition plan, and  shall implement, specific steps designed to encourage individuals of the  previously excluded sex to apply for admission to such institution. Such  steps shall include instituting recruitment programs that emphasize the  institution's commitment to enrolling students of the sex previously  excluded.</p>
