The installer shall leave the manufacturer's instructions attached to the appliance. Every appliance shall be secured in place to avoid displacement. For the purpose of servicing and replacement, each appliance shall be both accessible and removable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Heat-producing appliances shall be so located that no doors, drapes, or other such material can be placed or swing closer to the front of the appliance than the clearances specified on the labeled appliances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Clearances surrounding heat producing appliances shall not be less than the clearances specified in the terms of their listings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prevention of storage. The area surrounding heat producing appliances installed in areas with interior or exterior access shall be framed-in or guarded with noncombustible material such that the distance from the appliance to the framing or guarding material is not greater than three inches unless the appliance is installed in compliance with paragraph (c)(2), of this section. When clearance required by the listing

is greater than three inches, the guard or frame shall not be closer to the appliance than the distance provided in the listing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clearance spaces surrounding heat producing appliances are not required to be framed-in or guarded when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A space is designed specifically for a clothes washer or dryer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dimensions surrounding the appliance do not exceed three inches; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer affixes either to a side of an alcove or compartment containing the appliance, or to the appliance itself, in a clearly visible location, a 3 x 5 adhesive backed plastic laminated label or the equivalent which reads as follows:</p><p class="depth4">``Warning''</p><p class="depth4">This compartment is not to be used as a storage area. Storage of combustible materials or containers on or near any appliance in this compartment may create a fire hazard. Do not store such materials or containers in this compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All fuel-burning appliances, except ranges, ovens, illuminating appliances, clothes dryers, solid fuel-burning fireplaces and solid fuel-burning fireplace stoves, shall be installed to provide for the complete separation of the combustion system from the interior atmosphere of the manufactured home. Combustion air inlets and flue gas outlets shall be listed or certified as components of the appliance. The required separation may be obtained by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The installation of direct vent system (sealed combustion system) appliances, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The installation of appliances within enclosures so as to separate the appliance combustion system and venting system from the interior atmosphere of the manufactured home. There shall not be any door, removable access panel, or other opening into the enclosure from the inside of the manufactured home. Any opening for ducts, piping, wiring, etc., shall be sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A forced air appliance and its return-air system shall be designed and installed so that negative pressure created by the air-circulating fan cannot affect its or another appliance's combustion air supply or act to mix products of combustion with circulating air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The air circulating fan of a furnace installed in an enclosure with another fuel-burning appliance shall be operable only when any door or panel covering an opening in the furnace fan compartment or in a return air plenum or duct is in the closed position. This does not apply if both appliances are direct vent system (sealed combustion system) appliances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a warm air appliance is installed within an enclosure to conform to Sec. 3280.709(d)(2), each warm-air outlet and each return air inlet shall extend to the exterior of the enclosure. Ducts, if used for that purpose, shall not have any opening within the enclosure and shall terminate at a location exterior to the enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cooling coils installed as a portion of, or in connection with, any forced-air furnace shall be installed on the downstream side unless the furnace is specifically otherwise listed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An air conditioner evaporator section shall not be located in the air discharge duct or plenum of any forced-air furnace unless the manufactured home manufacturer has complied with certification required in Sec. 3280.511.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a cooling coil is installed with a forced-air furnace, the coil shall be installed in accordance with its listing. When a furnace-coil unit has a limited listing, the installation must be in accordance with that listing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When an external heating appliance or combination cooling/heating appliance is to be field installed, the home manufacturer shall make provision for proper location of the connections to the supply and return air systems. The manufacturer is not required to provide said appliance(s). The preparation by the manufacturer for connection to the home's supply and return air system shall include all fittings and connection ducts to the main duct and return air system such that the installer is only required to provide:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The appliance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any appliance connections to the home; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The connecting duct between the external appliance and the fitting installed on the home by the manufacturer. The above connection preparations by the manufacturer do not apply

to supply or return air systems designed only to accept external cooling (i.e., self contained air conditioning systems, etc.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The installation of a self contained air conditioner comfort cooling appliance shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The installation on a duct common with an installed heating appliance shall require the installation of an automatic damper or other means to prevent the cooled air from passing through the heating appliance unless the heating appliance is certified or listed for such application and the supply system is intended for such an application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The installation shall prevent the flow of heated air into the external cooling appliance and its connecting ducts to the manufactured home supply and return air system during the operation of the heating appliance installed in the manufactured home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The installation shall prevent simultaneous operation of the heating and cooling appliances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vertical clearance above cooking top. Ranges shall have a vertical clearance above the cooking top of not less than 24 inches. (See Sec. 3280.204).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Solid fuel-burning factory-built fireplaces and fireplace stoves listed for use in manufactured homes may be installed in manufactured homes provided they and their installation conform to the following paragraphs.
