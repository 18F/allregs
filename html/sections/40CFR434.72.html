The  plan must be approved by the permitting authority and incorporated into  the permit as an effluent limitation. The Pollution Abatement Plan must  identify characteristics of the pollution abatement area and the pre- existing discharges. The Pollution Abatement Plan must be designed to  reduce the pollution load from pre-existing discharges and must identify  the selected best management practices (BMPs) to be used. The plan must  describe the design specifications, construction specifications,  maintenance schedules, criteria for monitoring and inspection, and  expected performance of the BMPs. The BMPs must be implemented as  specified in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32 and  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following effluent limits apply to  pre-existing discharges:</p><p class="depth3">Effluent Limitations ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> Iron, total........................

Pre-existing discharges for which it is infeasible to collect samples  for determination of baseline pollutant levels include, but are not  limited to, discharges that exist as a diffuse groundwater flow that  cannot be assessed via sample collection; a base flow to a receiving  stream that cannot be monitored separate from the receiving stream; a  discharge on a steep or hazardous slope that is inaccessible for sample  collection; or, a number of pre-existing discharges so extensive that  monitoring of individual discharges is infeasible.</p>
