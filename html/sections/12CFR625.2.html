Adversary adjudications are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the  FCA or other agency is presented by an attorney or other representative  who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enforcement proceedings under 12 U.S.C. 2261-2273.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The failure of the FCA to identify a type of proceeding as an  adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application  by a party who believes that the proceeding is covered by the EAJA;  whether the proceeding is covered shall then be an issue for resolution  in proceedings on the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a proceeding includes both matters covered and excluded from  coverage by the EAJA, any award made will include only fees and expenses  related to covered issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proceedings under this part may be conducted by the FCA Board  (Board) or by the presiding officer (referred to as the ``adjudicative  officer'' in the EAJA), as defined in Sec. 622.2(f) of this chapter. If  the Board conducts proceedings, reference to the ``presiding officer''  in this part shall mean the Board, in applicable context. Where the  Board presides, the recommended decision under Sec. 625.26 of this part  will be omitted and the Board will make a final decision on the  application in accordance with Sec. 625.27 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a court reviews the underlying decision of the adversary  adjudication, an award for fees and other expenses may be made only  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(3).</p>
