                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, divide your product line into families of engines that are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout the useful life as described in this section. You may not group engines in different engine categories in the same family. Your engine family is limited to a single model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For Category 1 engines, group engines in the same engine family if they are the same in all the following aspects:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combustion cycle and the fuel with which the engine is intended or designed to be operated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cooling system (for example, raw-water vs. separate-circuit cooling).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Method of air aspiration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method of exhaust aftertreatment (for example, catalytic converter or particulate trap).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Combustion chamber design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Nominal bore and stroke.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cylinder arrangement (such as in-line vs. vee configurations).

However, for the purpose of applying small-volume family provisions of this part, we will consider the otherwise applicable engine family criteria of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may group engines that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section in the same engine family, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In unusual circumstances, you may group such engines in the same engine family if you show that their emission characteristics during the useful life will be similar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a small-volume engine manufacturer, you may group any Category 1 engines into a single engine family or you may group any Category 2 engines into a single engine family. This also applies if you are a post-manufacture marinizer modifying a base engine that has a valid certificate of conformity for any kind of nonroad or heavy-duty highway engine under this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (f) do not exempt any engines from meeting the standards and requirements in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you combine engines that are subject to different emission standards

into a single engine family under paragraph (f) of this section, you must certify the engine family to the more stringent set of standards for that model year. For Category 3 engine families that include a range of maximum in-use engine speeds, use the highest value of maximum in-use engine speed to establish the applicable NOX emission standard.
