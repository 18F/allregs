                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for drug sample distribution by means other than mail or common carrier. A manufacturer or authorized distributor of record may distribute by means other than mail or common carrier, by a representative or detailer, a drug sample to a practitioner licensed to prescribe the drug to

be sampled or, at the written request of such a licensed practitioner, to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer or authorized distributor of record receives from the licensed practitioner a written request signed by the licensed practitioner before the delivery of the drug sample;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer or authorized distributor of record verifies with the appropriate State authority that the practitioner requesting the drug sample is licensed or authorized under State law to prescribe the drug product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A receipt is signed by the recipient, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, when the drug sample is delivered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The receipt is returned to the manufacturer or distributor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (d) through (e) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of the written request forms for delivery of samples by a representative. (1) A written request for delivery of a drug sample by a representative to a licensed practitioner is required to contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written request for delivery of a drug sample by a representative to a licensed practitioner is required to contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, professional title, and signature of the practitioner making the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The practitioner's State license or authorization number, or, where a scheduled drug product is requested, the practitioner's Drug Enforcement Administration number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proprietary or established name and the strength of the drug sample requested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The quantity requested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name of the manufacturer and the authorized distributor of record, if the drug sample is requested from an authorized distributor of record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The date of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written request for delivery of a drug sample by a representative to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity is required to contain, in addition to all of the information in paragraph (b) of this section, the name and address of the pharmacy of the hospital or other health care entity to which the drug sample is to be delivered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of the receipt to be completed upon delivery of a drug sample. The receipt is to be on a form designated by the manufacturer or distributor, and is required to contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the drug sample is received at the address of the licensed practitioner who requested it, the receipt is required to contain the name, address, professional title, and signature of the practitioner or the practitioner's designee who acknowledges delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary or established name and strength of the drug sample; the quantity of the drug sample delivered; and the date of the delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the drug sample is received by the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity at the request of a licensed practitioner, the receipt is required to contain the name and address of the requesting licensed practitioner; the name and address of the hospital or health care entity pharmacy designated to receive the drug sample; the name, address, professional title, and signature of the person acknowledging delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary or established name and strength of the drug sample; the quantity of the drug sample delivered; and the date of the delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inventory and reconciliation of drug samples of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives. Each drug manufacturer or authorized distributor of record that distributes drug samples by means of representatives shall conduct, at least annually, a complete and accurate physical inventory of all drug samples. All drug samples in the possession or control of each manufacturer's and distributor's representatives are required to be inventoried and the results of the inventory are required to be recorded in an inventory record, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In addition, manufacturers and distributors shall reconcile the results of the physical inventory with the most recently completed prior physical inventory and create a report documenting the reconciliation process, as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The inventory record is required to identify all drug samples in a representative's stock by the proprietary or established name, dosage strength, and number of units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reconciliation report is required to include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inventory record for the most recently completed prior inventory;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A record of each drug sample shipment received since the most recently completed prior inventory, including the sender and date of the shipment, and the proprietary or established name, dosage strength, and number of sample units received;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A record of drug sample distributions since the most recently completed inventory showing the name and address of each recipient of each sample unit shipped, the date of the shipment, and the proprietary or established name, dosage strength, and number of sample units shipped. For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, ``distributions'' includes distributions to health care practitioners or designated hospital or health care entity pharmacies, transfers or exchanges with other firm representatives, returns to the manufacturer or authorized distributor, destruction of drug samples by a sales representative, and other types of drug sample dispositions. The specific type of distribution must be specified in the record;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A record of drug sample thefts or significant losses reported by the representative since the most recently completed prior inventory, including the approximate date of the occurrence and the proprietary or established name, dosage strength, and number of sample units stolen or lost; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A record summarizing the information required by paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The record must show, for each type of sample unit (i.e., sample units having the same established or proprietary name and dosage strength), the total number of sample units received, distributed, lost, or stolen since the most recently completed prior inventory. For example, a typical entry in this record may read ``50 units risperidone (1 mg) returned to manufacturer'' or simply ``Risperidone (1 mg)/50/returned to manufacturer.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each drug manufacturer or authorized distributor of record shall take appropriate internal control measures to guard against error and possible fraud in the conduct of the physical inventory and reconciliation, and in the preparation of the inventory record and reconciliation report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A manufacturer or authorized distributor of record shall carefully evaluate any apparent discrepancy or significant loss revealed through the inventory and reconciliation process and shall fully investigate any such discrepancy or significant loss that cannot be justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lists of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives.
