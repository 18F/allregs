                            <p class="depth0">The methods of computing overtime pay on the basic rates for piece workers, hourly rated employees, and salaried employees are the same as the methods of computing overtime pay at the regular rate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under an employment agreement the basic rate to be used in computing overtime compensation for a piece worker for hours of work in excess of 8 in each day is the employee's average hourly earnings for all work performed during that day. \23\ The employee is entitled to one-half the basic rate for each daily overtime hour in addition to the total piece work earnings for the day.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\23\ See Sec. 548.302.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An employee, who normally would come within the forty hour provision of section 7(a) of the Act, has a basic rate which is his monthly salary divided by the number of regular hours of work in the month. \24\ If the salary is intended to cover straight-time compensation for a forty hour week he would be entitled to overtime for every hour after forty computed on the basis of one and one-half times the established basic rate, in addition to his monthly salary. If the salary is intended to cover a workweek shorter than forty hours, such as thirty-five hours, he would be entitled to additional straight time at the basic rate for the hours between thirty-five and forty and also to overtime at one and one-half time that rate for all hours worked in excess of forty in a week.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\24\ See Sec. 548.301.
