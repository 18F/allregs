                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reporting requirement--(1) General rule. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a taxpayer takes a return position that any treaty of the United States (including, but not limited to, an income tax treaty, estate and gift tax treaty, or friendship, commerce and navigation treaty) overrules or modifies any provision of the Internal Revenue Code and thereby effects (or potentially effects) a reduction of any tax incurred as any time, the taxpayer shall disclose such return position on a statement (in the form required in paragraph (d) of this section) attached to such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a taxpayer takes a return position that any treaty of the United States (including, but not limited to, an income tax treaty, estate and gift tax treaty, or friendship, commerce and navigation treaty) overrules or modifies any provision of the Internal Revenue Code and thereby effects (or potentially effects) a reduction of any tax incurred as any time, the taxpayer shall disclose such return position on a statement (in the form required in paragraph (d) of this section) attached to such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a taxpayer takes a return position that any treaty of the United States (including, but not limited to, an income tax treaty, estate and gift tax treaty, or friendship, commerce and navigation treaty) overrules or modifies any provision of the Internal Revenue Code and thereby effects (or potentially effects) a reduction of any tax incurred as any time, the taxpayer shall disclose such return position on a statement (in the form required in paragraph (d) of this section) attached to such return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a return of tax would not otherwise be required to be filed, a return must nevertheless be filed for purposes of making the disclosure required by this section. For this purpose, such return need include only the taxpayer's name, address, taxpayer identifying number, and be signed under penalties of perjury (as well as the subject disclosure). Also, the taxpayer's taxable year shall be deemed to be the calendar year (unless the taxpayer has previously established, or timely chooses for this purpose to establish, a different taxable year). In the case of a disclosable return position relating solely to income subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a) of this chapter), however, the statement required to be filed in paragraph (d) of this section must instead be filed at times and in accordance with procedures published by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application. (i) A taxpayer is considered to adopt a ``return position'' when the taxpayer determines its tax liability with respect to a particular item of income, deduction or credit. A taxpayer may be considered to adopt a return position whether or not a return is actually filed. To determine whether a return position is a ``treaty-based return position'' so that reporting is required under this paragraph (a), the taxpayer must compare:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer is considered to adopt a ``return position'' when the taxpayer determines its tax liability with respect to a particular item of income, deduction or credit. A taxpayer may be considered to adopt a return position whether or not a return is actually filed. To determine whether a return position is a ``treaty-based return position'' so that reporting is required under this paragraph (a), the taxpayer must compare:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tax liability (including credits, carrybacks, carryovers, and other tax consequences or attributes for the current year as well as for any other affected tax years) to be reported on a return of the taxpayer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The tax liability (including such credits, carrybacks, carryovers, and other tax consequences or attributes) that would be reported if the relevant treaty provision did not exist.
If there is a difference (or potential difference) in these two amounts, the position taken on a return is a treaty-

based return position that must be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the event a taxpayer's return position is based on a conclusion that a treaty provision is consistent with a Code provision, but the effect of the treaty provision is to alter the scope of the Code provision from the scope that it would have in the absence of the treaty, then the return position is a treaty-based return position that must be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A return position is a treaty-based return position unless the taxpayer's conclusion that no reporting is required under paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section has a substantial probability of successful defense if challenged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of section 6114 and paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: X, a Country A corporation, claims the benefit of a provision of the income tax treaty between the United States and Country A that modifies a provision of the Code. This position does not result in a change of X's U.S. tax liability for the current tax year but does give rise to, or increases, a net operating loss which may be carried back (or forward) such that X's tax liability in the carryback (or forward) year may be affected by the position taken by X in the current year. X must disclose this treaty-based return position with its tax return for the current tax year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: Z, a domestic corporation, is engaged in a trade or business in Country B. Country B imposes a tax on the income from certain of Z's petroleum activities at a rate significantly greater than the rate applicable to income from other activities. Z claims a foreign tax credit for this tax on its tax return. The tax imposed on Z is specifically listed as a creditable tax in the income tax treaty between the United States and Country B; however, there is no specific authority that such tax would otherwise be a creditable tax for U.S. purposes under sections 901 or 903 of the Code. Therefore, in the absence of the treaty, the creditability of this petroleum tax would lack a substantial probability of successful defense if challenged, and Z must disclose this treaty-based return position (see also paragraph (b)(7) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reporting specifically required. Reporting is required under this section except as expressly waived under paragraph (c) of this section. The following list is not a list of all positions for which reporting is required under this section but is a list of particular positions for which reporting is specifically required. These positions are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That a nondiscrimination provision of a treaty precludes the application of any otherwise applicable Code provision, other than with respect to the making of or the effect of an election under section 897(i);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That a treaty reduces or modifies the taxation of gain or loss from the disposition of a United States real property interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That a treaty exempts a foreign corporation from (or reduces the amount of tax with respect to) the branch profits tax (section 884(a)) or the tax on excess interest (section 884(f)(1)(B));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A treaty exempts from tax, or reduces the rate of tax on, interest or dividends paid by a foreign corporation that are from sources within the United States by reason of section 861(a)(2)(B) or section 884(f)(1)(A); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A treaty exempts from tax, or reduces the rate of tax on, fixed or determinable annual or periodical income subject to withholding under section 1441 or 1442 that a foreign person receives from a U.S. person, but only if described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, or in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) or (D) of this section as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> the payment is not properly reported to the Service on a Form 1042S; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The foreign person is any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) in which the U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A foreign corporation that is controlled within the meaning of section 6038 by the U.S. person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A foreign shareholder of the U.S. person that, in the case of tax years beginning on or before July 10, 1989, is controlled within the meaning of section 6038A by the foreign shareholder, or, in the case of tax years beginning after July 10, 1989, is 25-percent owned

For purposes of the statement of facts relied upon to support each separate Treaty-Based Return Position taken, a taxpayer may treat payments or income items of the same type (e.g., interest items) received from the same ultimate payor (e.g., the obligor on a note) as a single separate payment or income item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign source effectively connected income. If a taxpayer takes the return position that, under the treaty, income that would be income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business is not subject to U.S. taxation because it is income treated as derived from sources outside the United States, the taxpayer may treat payments or income items of the same type (e.g., interest items) as a single separate payment or income item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sales or services income. Income from separate sales or services, whether or not made or performed by an agent (independent or dependent), to different U.S. customers on behalf of a foreign corporation not having a permanent establishment in the United States may be treated as a single payment or income item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Foreign insurers or reinsurers. For purposes of reporting by foreign insurers or reinsurers, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(vii)(B) of this section, such reporting must separately set forth premiums paid with respect to casualty insurance and indemnity bonds (subject to section 4371(1)); life insurance, sickness and accident policies, and annuity contracts (subject to section 4371(2)); and reinsurance (subject to section 4371(3)). All premiums paid with respect to each of these three categories may be treated as a single payment or income item within that category. For reports first due before May 1, 1991, the report may disclose, for each of the three categories, the total

amount of premiums derived by the foreign insurer or reinsurer in U.S. dollars (even if a portion of these premiums relate to risks that are not U.S. situs). Reasonable estimates of the amounts required to be disclosed will satisfy these reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years of the taxpayer for which the due date for filing returns (without extensions) occurs after December 31, 1988. However, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer has filed a return for such a taxable year, without complying with the reporting requirement of this section, before November 13, 1989, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A taxpayer is not otherwise than by paragraph (a) of this section required to file a return for a taxable year before November 13, 1989,
Such taxpayer must file (apart from any earlier filed return) the statement required by paragraph (d) of this section before June 12, 1990, by mailing the required statement to the Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 21086, Philadelphia, PA 19114. Any such statement filed apart from a return must be dated, signed and sworn to by the taxpayer under the penalties of perjury. In addition, with respect to any return due (without extensions) on or before March 10, 1990, the reporting required by paragraph (a) of this section must be made no later than June 12, 1990. If a taxpayer files or has filed a return on or before November 13, 1989, that provides substantially the same information required by paragraph (d) of this section, no additional submission will be required. Foreign insurers and reinsurers subject to reporting described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section must so report for calendar years 1988 and 1989 no later than August 15, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Cross reference.
