                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substance identified generically as butoxy-substituted ether alkane (PMN P-92-755) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified generically as butoxy-substituted ether alkane (PMN P-92-755) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(3), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). In addition, the employer must be able to demonstrate that the gloves selected for handling the chemical substance provide an impervious barrier to prevent dermal exposure during normal and expected duration and conditions of exposure within the work area by testing the material used to make the gloves and the construction of the gloves to establish that they will be impervious for the expected duration and conditions of exposure. The testing must subject the gloves to the expected conditions of exposure, including the likely combinations of chemical substances to which the gloves may be exposed in the work area. There must be no permeation of the gloves by the chemical substance (or an EPA-approved analogue) greater than 0.16 [micro]g/cm\2\/min after 8 h of testing in accordance with the most recent versions of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F739 ``Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases'' and ASTM F1194 ``Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing Materials.'' The employer must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval of the test results for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. Nitrile gloves with a minimum thickness of 0.5588 mm have already been tested and found to satisfy the terms of this section. Gloves contaminated with the PMN substance shall be disposed of after every work shift.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(ix), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(v), and (g)(5). In addition, the human health hazard statements shall include a statement that this substance may cause systemic toxicity and blood effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.80 (g) and (q).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. Recordkeeping requirements as specified in Sec. 721.125 (a) through (i) and records documenting compliance with the glove permeability testing requirements of this section are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section. The provisions of Sec. 721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section.
