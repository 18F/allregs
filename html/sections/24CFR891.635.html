For purposes of subpart E of this part, the  additional requirements apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Borrower may require each family occupying an unassisted  unit (or residential space in a group home) to pay a security deposit  equal to one month's rent payable by the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>, the Borrower shall allocate to the family's balance the  interest accrued on the balance during the year. Unless prohibited by  State or local law, the Borrower may deduct for the family, from the  accrued interest for the year, the administrative cost of computing the  allocation to the family's balance. The amount of the administrative  cost adjustment shall not exceed the accrued interest allocated to the  family's balance for the year.</p>
