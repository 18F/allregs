                            <p class="depth0">The answer is contingent upon whether the customer agency is in  Federally owned or leased space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless stated otherwise in the OA, a customer agency within a  GSA controlled, Federally owned building has automatic occupancy rights  at the end of the OA term for occupied space. However, a new OA must be  negotiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In leased space, the OA generally reflects the provisions of the  underlying lease and will specify whether or not renewal options are  available. If the OA does not include a renewal option, customer  agencies should assume relocation would be necessary upon OA expiration,  and budget for it. Further, renewal options are not, in themselves, a  guarantee of continued occupancy at that location. In some cases, the  renewal rate is substantially above market or the option was not part of  the initial price evaluation for the occupancy. In such cases, GSA may  be required to run a competition for the replacement lease, and a  relocation may ensue. Nonetheless, it is also possible that GSA may  execute a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor, in which case  there is no move.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> GSA and customer agencies should initiate discussions at least  18-20 months in advance of OA expiration to address an action for the  replacement or continued occupancy of the existing space assignment.  This allows both agencies time to budget for the work and the cost.</p>
