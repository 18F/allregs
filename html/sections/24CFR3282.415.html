                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sale or lease prohibited. Manufacturers, retailers, and  distributors must not sell, lease, or offer for sale or lease any  manufactured home that they have reason to know, in the exercise of due  care, contains a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent  safety hazard. The sale of a home to a purchaser is complete when all  contractual obligations of the manufacturer, retailer, and distributor  to the purchaser and conditions specified in Sec. 3282.252 have been  met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Retailer/distributor notification to manufacturer. When a  retailer, acting as a reasonable retailer, or a distributor, acting as a  reasonable distributor, believes that a manufactured home that has been  sold to the retailer or distributor, but for which there is no completed  sale to a purchaser, likely contains a noncompliance, defect, serious  defect, or imminent safety hazard, the retailer or distributor must  notify the manufacturer of the home in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturer's remedial responsibilities. Upon a Final  Determination pursuant to Sec. 3282.412(f) by the Secretary or an SAA,  a determination by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, or a  manufacturer's own determination that a manufactured home that has been  sold to a retailer but for which there is no completed sale to a  purchaser contains a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent  safety hazard, the manufacturer must do one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately repurchase such manufactured home from the retailer  or distributor at the price paid by the retailer or distributor, plus  pay all transportation charges involved, if any, and a reasonable  reimbursement of not less than one percent per month of such price paid,  prorated from the date the manufacturer receives notice by certified  mail of the noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety  hazard; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At its expense, immediately furnish to the retailer or  distributor all required parts or equipment for installation in the home  by the retailer or distributor, and the manufacturer must reimburse the  retailer or distributor for the reasonable value of the retailer's or  distributor's work, plus a reasonable reimbursement of not less than one  percent per month of the manufacturer's or distributor's selling price,  prorated from the date the manufacturer receives notice by certified  mail to the date the noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent  safety hazard is corrected, so long as the retailer or distributor  proceeds with reasonable diligence with the required work; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carry out all needed corrections to the home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establishing costs. The value of reasonable reimbursements as  specified in paragraph (c) of this section will be fixed by either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mutual agreement of the manufacturer and retailer or  distributor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A court in an action brought under section 613(b) of the Act (42  U.S.C. 5412(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records required. The manufacturer and the retailer or  distributor must maintain records of their actions taken under this  section in accordance with Sec. 3282.417.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception for leased homes. This section does not apply to any  manufactured home purchased by a retailer or distributor that has been  leased by such retailer or distributor to a tenant for purposes other  than resale. Other remedies that may be available to a retailer or  distributor under subpart I of this part continue to be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Indemnification. A manufacturer may indemnify itself through  agreements or contracts with retailers, distributors, transporters,  installers, or others for the costs of repurchase, parts, equipment, and  corrective work incurred by the manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (c).</p>
