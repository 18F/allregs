                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory review. All declassification requests made by a member  of the public, by a government employee or by an agency shall be handled  by the Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee. Under no  circumstances shall the Executive Director refuse to confirm the  existence or nonexistence of a document under the Freedom of Information  Act or the mandatory review provisions of other applicable law, unless  the fact of its existence or nonexistence would itself be classifiable  under applicable law. Although NCUA has no authority to classify or  declassify information, it occasionally handles information classified  by another agency. The Executive Director shall refer all  declassification requests to the agency that originally classified the  information. The Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee  shall notify the requesting person or agency that the request has been  referred to the originating agency and that all further inquiries and  appeals must be made directly to the other agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Handling and safeguarding national security information. All  information classified ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential''  shall be delivered to the Executive Director or the Executive Director's  designee immediately upon receipt. The Executive Director shall advise  those who may come into possession of such information of the name of  the current designee. If the Executive Director is unavailable, the  designee shall lock the documents, unopened, in the combination safe  located in the secure facility of the Office of the Executive Director.  If the Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee is  unavailable to receive such documents, the documents shall be delivered  in accordance with NCUA's mail handling procedures for classified  information. Under no circumstances shall classified materials that  cannot be delivered to the Executive Director or the Executive  Director's designee be stored in a location other than in the safe  designated by the Executive Director for information classified ``Top  Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storage. All classified documents shall be stored in the safe  designated by the Executive Director for information classified ``Top  Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential.'' The combination shall be  known only to the Executive Director and the Executive Director's   designee holding the proper security clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee education. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Executive Director shall send a memo  to every NCUA employee who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has a security clearance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May handle classified materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This memo shall describe NCUA procedures for handling,  reproducing and storing classified documents. The Executive Director  shall require each such employee to review applicable Executive Orders  on the classification of national security information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agency terminology. The National Credit Union Administration's  Central Office shall use the terms ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret'' or  ``Confidential'' only in relation to materials classified for national  security purposes.
