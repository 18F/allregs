                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exclusion and cease and desist orders. The Commission may modify reporting requirements of exclusion and cease and desist orders as necessary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To help the Commission assist the U.S. Customs Service in ascertaining that there has been compliance with an outstanding exclusion order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To help the Commission ascertain that there has been compliance with a cease and desist order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To take account of changed circumstances; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To minimize the burden of reporting or informational access.
An order to modify reporting requirements shall identify the reports involved and state the reason or reasons for modification. No reporting requirement will be suspended during the pendency of such a modification unless the Commission so orders. The Commission may, if the public interest warrants, announce that a modification of reporting is under consideration and ask for comment, but it may also modify any reporting requirement at any time without notice, consistent with the standards of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consent orders. Consistent with the standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may modify reporting requirements of consent orders. The Commission shall serve notice of any proposed change, together with the reporting requirements to be modified and the reasons therefor, on each party subject to the consent order. Such parties shall be given the opportunity to submit briefs to the Commission, and the Commission may hold a hearing on the matter. Notice of any proposed change in the reporting requirements will be published in the Federal Register if the Commission determines to solicit public comment on the proposed change.
