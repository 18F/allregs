                            <p class="depth0">A covered USG attorney's primary professional responsibility is to the client, as defined by Sec. 776.4 of this part, and he or she is expected to ensure that representation of such client is free from conflicts of interest and otherwise conforms to the requirements of these rules and other regulations concerning the provision of legal services within the Department of the Navy. The outside practice of law, therefore, must be carefully monitored. Covered USG attorneys who wish to engage in the part-time, outside practice of law must first obtain permission from JAG. Failure to obtain permission before engaging in the outside practice of law may subject the covered USG attorney to administrative or disciplinary action, including professional sanctions administered per subpart C of this part. Covered USG attorneys may obtain further details in JAGINST 5803.1 (series). This requirement does not apply to non-USG attorneys, or to Reserve or Retired judge advocates unless serving on active-duty for more than 30 consecutive days.</p>
