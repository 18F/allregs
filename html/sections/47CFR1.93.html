                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As used in this subpart, a ``consent order'' is a formal decree accepting an agreement between a party to an adjudicatory hearing proceeding held to determine whether that party has violated statutes or Commission rules or policies and the appropriate operating Bureau, with regard to such party's future compliance with such statutes, rules or policies, and disposing of all issues on which the proceeding was designated for hearing. The order is issued by the officer designated to preside at the hearing or (if no officer has been designated) by the Chief Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the interests of timely enforcement or compliance, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, the Commission, by its operating Bureaus, may negotiate a consent order with a party to secure future compliance with the law in exchange for prompt disposition of a matter subject to administrative adjudicative proceedings. Consent orders may not be negotiated with respect to matters which involve a party's basic statutory qualifications to hold a license (see 47 U.S.C. 308 and 309).
