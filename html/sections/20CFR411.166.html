Figures representing the number of credit hours required for the first and second progress certification periods as described in Sec. 411.180 will be rounded by dropping any fractions. Under the variance tolerance, we also will consider you to have met the requirements in an applicable progress certification period if you complete a certain percentage of the work requirement and a certain percentage of the post-secondary education requirement or vocational or technical training requirement in the period and the sum of the two percentages is within 10% of the goal. See Sec. 411.180(a) and (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> VR cost reimbursement option means an arrangement under which your ticket is not assigned to the State VR agency but you do receive services pursuant to an individualized plan for employment where the State VR agency has chosen to receive payment under the cost reimbursement payment system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> VR cost reimbursement status means the status of your ticket under the arrangement described in paragraph (i) of this section.
