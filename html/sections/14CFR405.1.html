                            <p class="depth0">Each licensee or permittee must allow access by and cooperate with  Federal officers or employees or other individuals authorized by the  Associate Administrator to observe licensed facilities and activities,  including launch sites and reentry sites, as well as manufacturing,  production, testing, and training facilities, or assembly sites used by  any contractor, licensee, or permittee to produce, assemble, or test a  launch or reentry vehicle and to integrate a payload with its launch or  reentry vehicle. Observations are conducted to monitor the activities of  the licensee, permittee, or contractor at such time and to such extent  as the Associate Administrator considers reasonable and necessary to  determine compliance with the license or permit or to perform the  Associate Administrator's responsibilities pertaining to payloads for  which no Federal license, authorization, or permit is required.
