                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0">Aggregate Tuning Hours means the total hours of programming that the Broadcaster has transmitted during the relevant period to all listeners within the United States from any channels and stations that provide audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of Eligible Transmissions.</p><p class="depth0">Broadcaster means an entity that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Has a substantial business owning and operating one or more terrestrial AM or FM radio stations that are licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Has obtained a compulsory license under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and 114 and the implementing regulations therefor to

make Eligible Transmissions and related ephemeral recordings;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Complies with all applicable provisions of Sections 112(e) and 114 and applicable regulations; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Is not a noncommercial webcaster as defined in 17 U.S.C. 114(f)(5)(E)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Broadcaster Webcasts mean eligible nonsubscription transmissions made by a Broadcaster over the Internet that are not Broadcast Retransmissions.</p><p class="depth0">Broadcast Retransmissions mean eligible nonsubscription transmissions made by a Broadcaster over the Internet that are retransmissions of terrestrial over-the-air broadcast programming transmitted by the Broadcaster through its AM or FM radio station, including ones with substitute advertisements or other programming occasionally substituted for programming for which requisite licenses or clearances to transmit over the Internet have not been obtained. For the avoidance of doubt, a Broadcast Retransmission does not include programming that does not require a license under United States copyright law or that is transmitted on an Internet-only side channel.</p><p class="depth0">Collective is the collection and distribution organization that is designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. For the 2011-2015 license period, the Collective is SoundExchange, Inc.</p><p class="depth0">Copyright Owners are sound recording copyright owners who are entitled to royalty payments made under this subpart pursuant to the statutory licenses under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and 114(f).</p><p class="depth0">Eligible Transmission shall mean either a Broadcaster Webcast or a Broadcast Retransmission.</p><p class="depth0">Ephemeral Recording is a phonorecord created for the purpose of facilitating an Eligible Transmission of a public performance of a sound recording under a statutory license in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 114(f), and subject to the limitations specified in 17 U.S.C. 112(e).</p><p class="depth0">Performance is each instance in which any portion of a sound recording is publicly performed to a listener by means of a digital audio transmission (e.g., the delivery of any portion of a single track from a compact disc to one listener) but excluding the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A performance of a sound recording that does not require a license (e.g., a sound recording that is not copyrighted);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A performance of a sound recording for which the Broadcaster has previously obtained a license from the Copyright Owner of such sound recording; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> An incidental performance that both:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Makes no more than incidental use of sound recordings including, but not limited to, brief musical transitions in and out of commercials or program segments, brief performances during news, talk and sports programming, brief background performances during disk jockey announcements, brief performances during commercials of sixty seconds or less in duration, or brief performances during sporting or other public events, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Other than ambient music that is background at a public event, does not contain an entire sound recording and does not feature a particular sound recording of more than thirty seconds (as in the case of a sound recording used as a theme song).</p><p class="depth0">Performers means the independent administrators identified in 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2)(B) and (C) and the parties identified in 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2)(D).</p><p class="depth0">Qualified Auditor is a Certified Public Accountant.</p><p class="depth0">Small Broadcaster is a Broadcaster that, for any of its channels and stations (determined as provided in Sec.  380.12(c)) over which it transmits Broadcast Retransmissions, and for all of its channels and stations over which it transmits Broadcaster Webcasts in the aggregate, in any calendar year in which it is to be considered a Small Broadcaster, meets the following additional eligibility criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> During the prior year it made Eligible Transmissions totaling less than 27,777 Aggregate Tuning Hours; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> During the applicable year it reasonably expects to make Eligible Transmissions totaling less than 27,777 Aggregate Tuning Hours; provided that, one time during the period 2011-2015, a Broadcaster that qualified as a Small Broadcaster under the foregoing definition as of January 31 of one year, elected Small Broadcaster status for

that year, and unexpectedly made Eligible Transmissions on one or more channels or stations in excess of 27,777 aggregate tuning hours during that year, may choose to be treated as a Small Broadcaster during the following year notwithstanding paragraph (1) of the definition of ``Small Broadcaster'' if it implements measures reasonably calculated to ensure that it will not make Eligible Transmissions exceeding 27,777 aggregate tuning hours during that following year. As to channels or stations over which a Broadcaster transmits Broadcast Retransmissions, the Broadcaster may elect Small Broadcaster status only with respect to any of its channels or stations that meet all of the foregoing criteria.</p>
