                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for hearing. The Commission will order a hearing, which  at the Commission's option may be oral or written, if the debtor submits  a written request for a hearing concerning, for debts not previously  established by judicial or administrative order, the existence or amount  of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment  schedules established other than by written agreement under Sec.  204.63(b)(2)), or for debts established by judicial or administrative  order, the payment or other discharge of the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type of hearing or review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this subpart,  whenever the Commission is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the  Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an  oral hearing when the Commission determined that the issues in dispute  cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example,  when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or  veracity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Commission determines that an oral hearing is  appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established  by the Commission. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be  conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel  expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing  will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the  hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this  section, the Commission will nevertheless accord the debtor a ``paper  hearing,'' that is, the Commission will decide the issues in dispute  based upon a review of the written record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of timely request. Subject to paragraph (l) of this  section, if the debtor's written request is received by the Commission  on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice  of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment, the Commission   will not issue a withholding order until the debtor has been provided  the requested hearing, and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (i)  and (j) of this section has been rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to timely request a hearing. If the debtor's written  request is received by the agency after the 15th business day following  the mailing of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek  garnishment, the Commission shall provide a hearing to the debtor.  However, the Commission will not delay issuance of a withholding order  unless the Commission determines that the delay in filing the request  was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or the  Commission receives information that the Commission believes justifies a  delay or cancellation of the withholding order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hearing official. All hearings shall be presided over by the  Commission, or if the Commission so orders, by a hearing official. When  the Commission designates that the hearing official shall be an  administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall  select, pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-10, the administrative law judge to  preside.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedure. After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing  official shall notify the debtor of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date and time of a telephonic hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Burden of proof. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission will have the burden of  going forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of  the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that  no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition,  the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule  are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that  collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Record. The hearing official will maintain a record of any  hearing provided under this section. A hearing is not required to be a  formal evidentiary-type hearing, however, witnesses who testify in oral  hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Date of decision. The hearing official shall issue a written  opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not  later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such  hearing was received by the Commission. If the Commission is unable to  provide the debtor with a hearing and a decision is not rendered within  sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request for such hearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A withholding order will not be issued until the hearing is held  and a decision rendered; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a withholding order had previously been issued to the  debtor's employer, the withholding order will be suspended beginning on  the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing  until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Content of decision. The written decision shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A summary of the facts presented;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The findings, analysis and conclusions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Finality of agency action. Unless the Commission on its own  initiative orders review of a decision by a hearing official pursuant to  17 CFR 201.431(c), a decision by a hearing official shall become the  final decision of the Commission for the purpose of judicial review  under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor  who fails to appear at a scheduled hearing will be deemed as not having  timely filed a request for a hearing.</p>
