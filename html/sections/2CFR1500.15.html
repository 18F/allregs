If the Appeal was timely submitted, the notice  of acknowledgement may identify any additional information or  documentation that is required for a thorough consideration of the  Appeal. The notice should provide no more than 30 calendar days for the  Affected Entity to provide the requested information. If it is not  feasible to identify such information or documentation in the notice the  DDO may request it at a later point in time prior to Appeal resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Untimely Appeals. If the DDO did not receive the Appeal within  the required 30-day period, or any extension of it, the DDO will notify  the Affected Entity that the Appeal is being dismissed as untimely and  the Agency Decision of the AO becomes final. The notification will also  identify the Review Official. The dismissal of an untimely Appeal  constitutes the final agency action, unless further review is sought in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1500.16. In limited  circumstances, the DDO may, as a matter of discretion, consider an  untimely Appeal if doing so would be in the interests of fairness and  equity.</p>
