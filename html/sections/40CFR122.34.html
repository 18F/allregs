                                Sec. 122.34  As an operator of a regulated small MS4, what will
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Your NPDES MS4 permit will require at a minimum that you develop, implement, and enforce a storm water management program designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from your MS4 to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act. Your storm water management program must include the minimum control measures described in paragraph (b) of this section unless you apply for a permit under Sec. 122.26(d). For purposes of this section, narrative effluent limitations requiring implementation of best management practices (BMPs) are generally the most appropriate form of effluent limitations when designed to satisfy technology requirements (including reductions of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable) and to protect water quality. Implementation of best management practices consistent with the provisions of the storm water management program required pursuant to this section and the provisions of the permit required pursuant to Sec. 122.33 constitutes compliance with the standard of reducing pollutants to the ``maximum extent practicable.'' Your NPDES permitting authority will specify a time period of up to 5 years from the date of permit issuance for you to develop and implement your program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minimum control measures--(1) Public education and outreach on storm water impacts. (i) You must implement a public education program to distribute educational materials to the community or conduct equivalent outreach activities about the impacts of storm

water discharges on water bodies and the steps that the public can take to reduce pollutants in storm water runoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guidance: You may use storm water educational materials provided by your State, Tribe, EPA, environmental, public interest or trade organizations, or other MS4s. The public education program should inform individuals and households about the steps they can take to reduce storm water pollution, such as ensuring proper septic system maintenance, ensuring the proper use and disposal of landscape and garden chemicals including fertilizers and pesticides, protecting and restoring riparian vegetation, and properly disposing of used motor oil or household hazardous wastes. EPA recommends that the program inform individuals and groups how to become involved in local stream and beach restoration activities as well as activities that are coordinated by youth service and conservation corps or other citizen groups. EPA recommends that the public education program be tailored, using a mix of locally appropriate strategies, to target specific audiences and communities. Examples of strategies include distributing brochures or fact sheets, sponsoring speaking engagements before community groups, providing public service announcements, implementing educational programs targeted at school age children, and conducting community-based projects such as storm drain stenciling, and watershed and beach cleanups. In addition, EPA recommends that some of the materials or outreach programs be directed toward targeted groups of commercial, industrial, and institutional entities likely to have significant storm water impacts. For example, providing information to restaurants on the impact of grease clogging storm drains and to garages on the impact of oil discharges. You are encouraged to tailor your outreach program to address the viewpoints and concerns of all communities, particularly minority and disadvantaged communities, as well as any special concerns relating to children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public involvement/participation. (i) You must, at a minimum, comply with State, Tribal and local public notice requirements when implementing a public involvement/ participation program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guidance: EPA recommends that the public be included in developing, implementing, and reviewing your storm water management program and that the public participation process should make efforts to reach out and engage all economic and ethnic groups. Opportunities for members of the public to participate in program development and implementation include serving as citizen representatives on a local storm water management panel, attending public hearings, working as citizen volunteers to educate other individuals about the program, assisting in program coordination with other pre-existing programs, or participating in volunteer monitoring efforts. (Citizens should obtain approval where necessary for lawful access to monitoring sites.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illicit discharge detection and elimination. (i) You must develop, implement and enforce a program to detect and eliminate illicit discharges (as defined at Sec. 122.26(b)(2)) into your small MS4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Develop, if not already completed, a storm sewer system map, showing the location of all outfalls and the names and location of all waters of the United States that receive discharges from those outfalls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To the extent allowable under State, Tribal or local law, effectively prohibit, through ordinance, or other regulatory mechanism, non-storm water discharges into your storm sewer system and implement appropriate enforcement procedures and actions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Develop and implement a plan to detect and address non-storm water discharges, including illegal dumping, to your system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Inform public employees, businesses, and the general public of hazards associated with illegal discharges and improper disposal of waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You need address the following categories of non-storm water discharges or flows (i.e., illicit discharges) only if you identify them as significant contributors of pollutants to your small MS4: water line flushing, landscape irrigation, diverted stream flows,

rising ground waters, uncontaminated ground water infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR 35.2005(20)), uncontaminated pumped ground water, discharges from potable water sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space pumps, footing drains, lawn watering, individual residential car washing, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges, and street wash water (discharges or flows from fire fighting activities are excluded from the effective prohibition against non-storm water and need only be addressed where they are identified as significant sources of pollutants to waters of the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Guidance: EPA recommends that the plan to detect and address illicit discharges include the following four components: procedures for locating priority areas likely to have illicit discharges; procedures for tracing the source of an illicit discharge; procedures for removing the source of the discharge; and procedures for program evaluation and assessment. EPA recommends visually screening outfalls during dry weather and conducting field tests of selected pollutants as part of the procedures for locating priority areas. Illicit discharge education actions may include storm drain stenciling, a program to promote, publicize, and facilitate public reporting of illicit connections or discharges, and distribution of outreach materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Construction site storm water runoff control. (i) You must develop, implement, and enforce a program to reduce pollutants in any storm water runoff to your small MS4 from construction activities that result in a land disturbance of greater than or equal to one acre. Reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity disturbing less than one acre must be included in your program if that construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more. If the NPDES permitting authority waives requirements for storm water discharges associated with small construction activity in accordance with Sec. 122.26(b)(15)(i), you are not required to develop, implement, and/or enforce a program to reduce pollutant discharges from such sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your program must include the development and implementation of, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An ordinance or other regulatory mechanism to require erosion and sediment controls, as well as sanctions to ensure compliance, to the extent allowable under State, Tribal, or local law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requirements for construction site operators to implement appropriate erosion and sediment control best management practices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Requirements for construction site operators to control waste such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Procedures for site plan review which incorporate consideration of potential water quality impacts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Procedures for receipt and consideration of information submitted by the public, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Procedures for site inspection and enforcement of control measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Guidance: Examples of sanctions to ensure compliance include non-monetary penalties, fines, bonding requirements and/or permit denials for non-compliance. EPA recommends that procedures for site plan review include the review of individual pre-construction site plans to ensure consistency with local sediment and erosion control requirements. Procedures for site inspections and enforcement of control measures could include steps to identify priority sites for inspection and enforcement based on the nature of the construction activity, topography, and the characteristics of soils and receiving water quality. You are encouraged to provide appropriate educational and training measures for construction site operators. You may wish to require a storm water pollution prevention plan for construction sites within your jurisdiction that discharge into your system. See Sec. 122.44(s) (NPDES permitting authorities' option to incorporate qualifying State, Tribal and local erosion and sediment control programs into NPDES permits for storm water discharges from construction sites).

Also see Sec. 122.35(b) (The NPDES permitting authority may recognize that another government entity, including the permitting authority, may be responsible for implementing one or more of the minimum measures on your behalf.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Post-construction storm water management in new development and redevelopment. (i) You must develop, implement, and enforce a program to address storm water runoff from new development and redevelopment projects that disturb greater than or equal to one acre, including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale, that discharge into your small MS4. Your program must ensure that controls are in place that would prevent or minimize water quality impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Develop and implement strategies which include a combination of structural and/or non-structural best management practices (BMPs) appropriate for your community;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use an ordinance or other regulatory mechanism to address post-construction runoff from new development and redevelopment projects to the extent allowable under State, Tribal or local law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of BMPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Guidance: If water quality impacts are considered from the beginning stages of a project, new development and potentially redevelopment provide more opportunities for water quality protection. EPA recommends that the BMPs chosen: be appropriate for the local community; minimize water quality impacts; and attempt to maintain pre-development runoff conditions. In choosing appropriate BMPs, EPA encourages you to participate in locally-based watershed planning efforts which attempt to involve a diverse group of stakeholders including interested citizens. When developing a program that is consistent with this measure's intent, EPA recommends that you adopt a planning process that identifies the municipality's program goals (e.g., minimize water quality impacts resulting from post-construction runoff from new development and redevelopment), implementation strategies (e.g., adopt a combination of structural and/or non-structural BMPs), operation and maintenance policies and procedures, and enforcement procedures. In developing your program, you should consider assessing existing ordinances, policies, programs and studies that address storm water runoff quality. In addition to assessing these existing documents and programs, you should provide opportunities to the public to participate in the development of the program. Non-structural BMPs are preventative actions that involve management and source controls such as: policies and ordinances that provide requirements and standards to direct growth to identified areas, protect sensitive areas such as wetlands and riparian areas, maintain and/or increase open space (including a dedicated funding source for open space acquisition), provide buffers along sensitive water bodies, minimize impervious surfaces, and minimize disturbance of soils and vegetation; policies or ordinances that encourage infill development in higher density urban areas, and areas with existing infrastructure; education programs for developers and the public about project designs that minimize water quality impacts; and measures such as minimization of percent impervious area after development and minimization of directly connected impervious areas. Structural BMPs include: storage practices such as wet ponds and extended-detention outlet structures; filtration practices such as grassed swales, sand filters and filter strips; and infiltration practices such as infiltration basins and infiltration trenches. EPA recommends that you ensure the appropriate implementation of the structural BMPs by considering some or all of the following: pre-construction review of BMP designs; inspections during construction to verify BMPs are built as designed; post-construction inspection and maintenance of BMPs; and penalty provisions for the noncompliance with design, construction or operation and maintenance. Storm water technologies are constantly being improved, and EPA recommends that your requirements be responsive to these changes, developments or improvements in control technologies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Pollution prevention/good housekeeping for municipal operations. (i) You must develop and implement an operation and maintenance program that includes a training component and has the ultimate goal of preventing or reducing pollutant runoff from municipal operations. Using training materials that are available from EPA, your State, Tribe, or other organizations, your program must include employee training to prevent and reduce storm water pollution from activities such as park and open space maintenance, fleet and building maintenance, new construction and land disturbances, and storm water system maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guidance: EPA recommends that, at a minimum, you consider the following in developing your program: maintenance activities, maintenance schedules, and long-term inspection procedures for structural and non-structural storm water controls to reduce floatables and other pollutants discharged from your separate storm sewers; controls for reducing or eliminating the discharge of pollutants from streets, roads, highways, municipal parking lots, maintenance and storage yards, fleet or maintenance shops with outdoor storage areas, salt/sand storage locations and snow disposal areas operated by you, and waste transfer stations; procedures for properly disposing of waste removed from the separate storm sewers and areas listed above (such as dredge spoil, accumulated sediments, floatables, and other debris); and ways to ensure that new flood management projects assess the impacts on water quality and examine existing projects for incorporating additional water quality protection devices or practices. Operation and maintenance should be an integral component of all storm water management programs. This measure is intended to improve the efficiency of these programs and require new programs where necessary. Properly developed and implemented operation and maintenance programs reduce the risk of water quality problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If an existing qualifying local program requires you to implement one or more of the minimum control measures of paragraph (b) of this section, the NPDES permitting authority may include conditions in your NPDES permit that direct you to follow that qualifying program's requirements rather than the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. A qualifying local program is a local, State or Tribal municipal storm water management program that imposes, at a minimum, the relevant requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> In your permit application (either a notice of intent for coverage under a general permit or an individual permit application), you must identify and submit to your NPDES permitting authority the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In your permit application (either a notice of intent for coverage under a general permit or an individual permit application), you must identify and submit to your NPDES permitting authority the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The best management practices (BMPs) that you or another entity will implement for each of the storm water minimum control measures at paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The measurable goals for each of the BMPs including, as appropriate, the months and years in which you will undertake required actions, including interim milestones and the frequency of the action; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person or persons responsible for implementing or coordinating your storm water management program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you obtain coverage under a general permit, you are not required to meet any measurable goal(s) identified in your notice of intent in order to demonstrate compliance with the minimum control measures in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6) of this section unless, prior to submitting your NOI, EPA or your State or Tribe has provided or issued a menu of BMPs that addresses each such minimum measure. Even if no regulatory authority issues the menu of BMPs, however, you still must comply with other requirements of the general permit, including good faith implementation of BMPs designed to comply with the minimum measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Guidance: Either EPA or your State or Tribal permitting authority will provide a menu of BMPs. You may choose BMPs from the menu or select others that satisfy the minimum control measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> You must comply with any more stringent effluent limitations in

your permit, including permit requirements that modify, or are in addition to, the minimum control measures based on an approved total maximum daily load (TMDL) or equivalent analysis. The permitting authority may include such more stringent limitations based on a TMDL or equivalent analysis that determines such limitations are needed to protect water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must comply with any more stringent effluent limitations in

your permit, including permit requirements that modify, or are in addition to, the minimum control measures based on an approved total maximum daily load (TMDL) or equivalent analysis. The permitting authority may include such more stringent limitations based on a TMDL or equivalent analysis that determines such limitations are needed to protect water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Guidance: EPA strongly recommends that until the evaluation of the storm water program in Sec. 122.37, no additional requirements beyond the minimum control measures be imposed on regulated small MS4s without the agreement of the operator of the affected small MS4, except where an approved TMDL or equivalent analysis provides adequate information to develop more specific measures to protect water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> You must comply with other applicable NPDES permit requirements, standards and conditions established in the individual or general permit, developed consistent with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 122.41 through 122.49, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Evaluation and assessment--(1) Evaluation. You must evaluate program compliance, the appropriateness of your identified best management practices, and progress towards achieving your identified measurable goals.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (g)(1): The NPDES permitting authority may determine monitoring requirements for you in accordance with State/Tribal monitoring plans appropriate to your watershed. Participation in a group monitoring program is encouraged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recordkeeping. You must keep records required by the NPDES permit for at least 3 years. You must submit your records to the NPDES permitting authority only when specifically asked to do so. You must make your records, including a description of your storm water management program, available to the public at reasonable times during regular business hours (see Sec. 122.7 for confidentiality provision). (You may assess a reasonable charge for copying. You may require a member of the public to provide advance notice.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting. Unless you are relying on another entity to satisfy your NPDES permit obligations under Sec. 122.35(a), you must submit annual reports to the NPDES permitting authority for your first permit term. For subsequent permit terms, you must submit reports in year two and four unless the NPDES permitting authority requires more frequent reports. Your report must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The status of compliance with permit conditions, an assessment of the appropriateness of your identified best management practices and progress towards achieving your identified measurable goals for each of the minimum control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results of information collected and analyzed, including monitoring data, if any, during the reporting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A summary of the storm water activities you plan to undertake during the next reporting cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A change in any identified best management practices or measurable goals for any of the minimum control measures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notice that you are relying on another governmental entity to satisfy some of your permit obligations (if applicable).
