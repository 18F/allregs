                                Sec. 102.10  Rendering assistance at the scene of the accident.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Always in the case of a scheduled United States air carrier and whenever necessary in the case of a non-scheduled carrier or private plane, a local Foreign Service post should dispatch a member of its staff to the scene of the accident in order to insure that proper protection is afforded United States citizens and property involved in the accident and that any evidence as to the cause of the accident is preserved until the arrival of United States Government investigating personnel. (For steps to be taken when the aircraft was carrying a courier or diplomatic pouches, see Sec. 102.14(b).) In the absence of an airline representative, the Foreign Service representative should lend the competent local authorities all possible assistance compatible with the provisions of Sec. 102.11 in caring for the survivors, identifying and disposing of the remains of victims, salvaging and protecting property and preserving wreckage pending an investigation. If an airline representative is already at the scene of the accident or if one arrives shortly thereafter, the Foreign Service representative should assist him in the discharge of his recognized responsibilities in connection with passengers and cargo. However, the Foreign Service representative is also obligated to assist investigating personnel of the United States Government by preserving evidence as to the cause of the accident. Any attempt on the part of the airline representative to exceed his recognized sphere of activity should be called to the attention of the airline involved and the competent local authorities.</p>
