(1) Every individual seeking recognition shall answer all questions in the application for registration and request(s) for comments issued by OED; disclose all relevant facts, dates and information; and provide verified copies of documents relevant to his or her good moral character and reputation.

character or reputation of an individual seeking registration or recognition, the OED Director shall conduct an investigation into the good moral character and reputation of that individual.

An individual failing to timely answer questions or respond to an inquiry by OED shall be deemed to have withdrawn his or her application, and shall be required to reapply, pass the examination, and otherwise satisfy all the requirements of this section.

Evidence showing lack of good moral character and reputation may include, but is not limited to, conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, drug or alcohol abuse; lack of candor; suspension or disbarment on ethical grounds from a State bar; and resignation from a State bar while under investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conviction of felony or misdemeanor. An individual who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, breach of trust, interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or conspiracy to commit any felony or misdemeanor, is presumed not to be of good moral character and reputation in the absence of a pardon or a satisfactory showing of reform and rehabilitation, and shall file with his or her application for registration the fees required by Sec.  1.21(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(10) of this subchapter. The OED Director shall determine whether individuals convicted of said felony or misdemeanor provided satisfactory proof of reform and rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall not be eligible to apply for registration during the time of any sentence (including confinement or commitment to imprisonment), deferred adjudication, and period of probation or parole as a result of the conviction, and for a period of two years after the date of completion of the sentence, deferred adjudication, and period of probation or parole, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following presumptions apply to the determination of good moral character and reputation of an individual convicted of said felony or misdemeanor:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The court record or docket entry of conviction is conclusive evidence of guilt in the absence of a pardon or a satisfactory showing of reform or rehabilitation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An individual convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section is conclusively deemed not to have good moral character and reputation, and shall not be eligible to apply for registration for a period of two years after completion of the sentence, deferred adjudication, and period of probation or parole, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual, upon applying for registration, shall provide satisfactory evidence that he or she is of good moral character and reputation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon proof that a conviction has been set aside or reversed, the individual shall be eligible to file a complete application for registration and the fee required by Sec.  1.21(a)(1)(ii) of this subchapter and, upon passing the registration examination, have the OED Director determine, in accordance with

paragraph (h)(1) of this section, whether, absent the conviction, the individual possesses good moral character and reputation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Good moral character and reputation involving drug or alcohol abuse. An individual's record is reviewed as a whole to see if there is a drug or alcohol abuse issue. An individual appearing to abuse drugs or alcohol may be asked to undergo an evaluation, at the individual's expense, by a qualified professional approved by the OED Director. In instances where, before an investigation commences, there is evidence of a present abuse or an individual has not established a record of recovery, the OED Director may request the individual to withdraw his or her application, and require the individual to satisfactorily demonstrate that he or she is complying with treatment and undergoing recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Moral character and reputation involving lack of candor. An individual's lack of candor in disclosing facts bearing on or relevant to issues concerning good moral character and reputation when completing the application or any time thereafter may be found to be cause to deny registration on moral character and reputation grounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Moral character and reputation involving suspension, disbarment, or resignation from a profession. (i) An individual who has been disbarred or suspended from practice of law or other profession, or has resigned in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding (excluded or disbarred on consent) shall be ineligible to apply for registration as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual who has been disbarred or suspended from practice of law or other profession, or has resigned in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding (excluded or disbarred on consent) shall be ineligible to apply for registration as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An individual who has been disbarred from practice of law or other profession, or has resigned in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding (excluded or disbarred on consent) shall be ineligible to apply for registration for a period of five years from the date of disbarment or resignation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An individual who has been suspended on ethical grounds from the practice of law or other profession shall be ineligible to apply for registration until expiration of the period of suspension.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An individual who was not only disbarred, suspended or resigned in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding, but also convicted in a court of a felony, or of a crime involving moral turpitude or breach of trust, shall be ineligible to apply for registration until the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(4) of this section are fully satisfied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual who has been disbarred or suspended, or who resigned in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding shall file an application for registration and the fees required by Sec.  1.21(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(10) of this subchapter; provide a full and complete copy of the proceedings that led to the disbarment, suspension, or resignation; and provide satisfactory proof that he or she possesses good moral character and reputation. The following presumptions shall govern the determination of good moral character and reputation of an individual who has been licensed to practice law or other profession in any jurisdiction and has been disbarred, suspended on ethical grounds, or allowed to resign in lieu of discipline, in that jurisdiction:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A copy of the record resulting in disbarment, suspension or resignation is prima facie evidence of the matters contained in the record, and the imposition of disbarment or suspension, or the acceptance of the resignation of the individual shall be deemed conclusive that the individual has committed professional misconduct.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The individual is ineligible for registration and is deemed not to have good moral character and reputation during the period of the imposed discipline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The only defenses available with regard to an underlying disciplinary matter resulting in disbarment, suspension on ethical grounds, or resignation in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding are set out below, and must be shown to the satisfaction of the OED Director:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The procedure in the disciplinary court was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> There was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the Office could not, consistently with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The finding of lack of good moral character and reputation by the Office would result in grave injustice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Factors that may be taken into consideration when evaluating rehabilitation of an individual seeking a moral character and reputation determination. The factors enumerated below are guidelines to assist the OED Director in determining whether an individual has demonstrated rehabilitation from an act of misconduct or moral turpitude. The factors include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of the act of misconduct, including whether it involved moral turpitude, whether there were aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and whether the activity was an isolated event or part of a pattern;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The age and education of the individual at the time of the misconduct and the age and education of the individual at the present time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The length of time that has passed between the misconduct and the present, absent any involvement in any further acts of moral turpitude, the amount of time and the extent of rehabilitation being dependent upon the nature and seriousness of the act of misconduct under consideration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Restitution by the individual to any person who suffered monetary losses through acts or omissions of the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expungement of a conviction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Successful completion or early discharge from probation or parole;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Abstinence from the use of controlled substances or alcohol for not less than two years if the specific misconduct was attributable in part to the use of a controlled substance or alcohol, where abstinence may be demonstrated by, but is not necessarily limited to, enrolling in and complying with a self-help or professional treatment program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the specific misconduct was attributable in part to a medically recognized mental disease, disorder or illness, proof that the individual sought professional assistance, and complied with the treatment program prescribed by the professional, and submitted letters from the treating psychiatrist/psychologist verifying that the medically recognized mental disease, disorder or illness will not impede the individual's ability to competently practice before the Office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Payment of the fine imposed in connection with any criminal conviction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Correction of behavior responsible in some degree for the misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Significant and conscientious involvement in programs designed to provide social benefits or to ameliorate social problems; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Change in attitude from that which existed at the time of the act of misconduct in question as evidenced by any or all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statements of the individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statements from persons familiar with the individual's previous misconduct and with subsequent attitudes and behavioral patterns;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Statements from probation or parole officers or law enforcement officials as to the individual's social adjustments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Statements from persons competent to testify with regard to neuropsychiatry or emotional disturbances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Notice to Show Cause. The OED Director shall inquire into the good moral character and reputation of an individual seeking registration, providing the individual with the opportunity to create a record on which a decision is made. If, following inquiry and consideration of the record, the OED Director is of the opinion that the individual seeking registration has not satisfactorily established that he or she possesses good moral character and reputation, the OED Director shall issue to the individual a notice to show cause why the individual's application for registration should not be denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual shall be given no less than ten days from the date of the notice to reply. The notice shall be given by certified mail at the address appearing on the application if the address is in the United States, and by any other reasonable means if the address is outside the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following receipt of the individual's response, or in the absence of a response, the OED Director shall consider the individual's response, if any, and the record, and determine whether,

in the OED Director's opinion, the individual has sustained his or her burden of satisfactorily demonstrating that he or she possesses good moral character and reputation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Reapplication for registration. An individual who has been refused registration for lack of good moral character or reputation may reapply for registration two years after the date of the decision, unless a shorter period is otherwise ordered by the USPTO Director. An individual, who has been notified that he or she is under investigation for good moral character and reputation may elect to withdraw his or her application for registration, and may reapply for registration two years after the date of withdrawal. Upon reapplication for registration, the individual shall pay the fees required by Sec.  1.21(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(10) of this subchapter, and has the burden of showing to the satisfaction of the OED Director his or her possession of good moral character and reputation as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Upon reapplication for registration, the individual also shall complete successfully the examination prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, even though the individual has previously passed a registration examination.</p>
