                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Port directors may accept certificates of marking supported by samples of articles required to be marked, for which Customs Form 4647 was issued, from importers or from actual owners complying with the provision of Sec. 141.20 of this chapter, to certify that marking of the country of origin on imported articles as required by this part has been accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing of certificates of marking. The certificates of marking shall be filed in duplicate with the port director, and a sample of the marked merchandise shall accompany the certificate. The port director may waive the production of the marked sample when he is satisfied that the submission of such sample is impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of acceptance. The port director shall notify the importer or actual owner when the certificate of marking is accepted. Such notice of acceptance may be granted on the duplicate copy of the certificate of marking by use of a stamped notation of acceptance. The port director is authorized to spot check the marking of articles on which a certificate has been filed. If a spot check is performed, the approved copy of the certificate, if approval is granted, shall be returned to the importer or actual owner after the spot check is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing of false certificate of marking. If a false certificate of marking is filed with the port director indicating that goods have been properly marked when in fact they have not been so marked, a seizure shall be made or claim for monetary penalty reported under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592). In addition, in cases involving, willful deceit, a criminal case report may be made charging a violation of section 1001, title 18, United States Code, which provides for a fine up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years for anyone who willfully conceals a material fact or uses any document knowing the same to contain any false or fraudulent statement in connection with any matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authority to require physical supervision when deemed necessary. The port director may require physical supervision of marking as specified in Sec. 134.51(c) in those cases in which he determines that such action is necessary to insure compliance with this part. In such cases the expenses of the Customs officer shall be reimbursed to the Government as provided for in Sec. 134.55.
