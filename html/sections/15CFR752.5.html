To determine whether your company requires a consultation before you apply for an SCL, contact BIS at the address, phone, or telefacsimile numbers included in Sec. 752.17 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pre-application consultation.

BIS will review the following criteria

to help determine SCL holder eligibility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of past licensing history and projected, continuous large volume exports;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reliability of all parties relative to their compliance with the EAR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commitment of all parties of the necessary resources to implement and maintain an adequate ICP; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Evidence of all parties knowledge of all provisions of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step Two: Establish consignee reliability--(1) Requirements.

You must make an initial determination of the reliability of all consignees that are listed on your application for an SCL, based upon the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining reliability. The criteria that you should take into consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Criteria. (A) The proposed consignee has a satisfactory record established through BIS pre-license checks, or extensive experience as a consignee under any license issued by BIS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The proposed consignee has a satisfactory record established through BIS pre-license checks, or extensive experience as a consignee under any license issued by BIS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The proposed consignee is a wholly-owned subsidiary or a controlled-in-fact affiliate of the applicant or of a consignee that is already approved on an SCL.

The items exported will be retained under my (our) ownership and control, and will be returned by me (us) to (name destination) promptly after their exhibit or demonstration abroad, and in no case later than one year after the date of reexport, unless other disposition is authorized in writing by the Bureau of Industry and Security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Chemicals and chemical equipment certification.
