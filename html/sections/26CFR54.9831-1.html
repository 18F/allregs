                            <p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Limited wraparound coverage. Limited benefits provided through  a group health plan that wrap around eligible individual health  insurance (or Basic Health Plan coverage described in section 1331 of  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act); or that wrap around  coverage under a Multi-State Plan described in section 1334 of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively referred to as  ``limited wraparound coverage,'' are excepted benefits if all of the  following conditions are satisfied. For this purpose, eligible  individual health insurance is individual health insurance coverage that  is not a grandfathered health plan (as described in section 1251 of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and 29 CFR 2590.715-1251),  not a transitional individual health insurance plan (as described in the  March 5, 2014 Insurance Standards Bulletin Series--Extension of  Transitional Policy through October 1, 2016), and does not consist  solely of excepted benefits (as defined in paragraph (c) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Covers additional benefits. The limited wraparound coverage  provides meaningful benefits beyond coverage of cost sharing under  either the eligible individual health insurance, Basic Health Program  coverage, or Multi-State Plan coverage. The limited wraparound coverage  must not provide benefits only under a coordination-of-benefits  provision and must not consist of an account-based reimbursement  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> or (2) of this section. Making  a determination regarding the annual cost of coverage per employee must  occur on an aggregate basis relying on sound actuarial principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The maximum permitted annual salary reduction contribution  toward health flexible spending arrangements, indexed in the manner  prescribed under section 125(i)(2). For this purpose, the cost of  coverage under the limited wraparound includes both employer and  employee contributions towards coverage and is determined in the same  manner as the applicable premium is calculated under a COBRA  continuation provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fifteen percent of the cost of coverage under the primary plan.  For this purpose, the cost of coverage under the primary plan and under  the limited wraparound coverage includes both employer and employee  contributions towards the coverage and each is determined in the same  manner as the applicable premium is calculated under a COBRA  continuation provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No preexisting condition exclusion. The limited wraparound  coverage does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion, consistent  with the requirements of section 2704 of the PHS Act (incorporated by  reference into section 9815) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2704.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No discrimination based on health status. The limited wraparound  coverage does not discriminate against individuals in eligibility,  benefits, or premiums based on any health factor of an individual (or  any dependent of the individual, as defined in Sec. 54.9801-2),  consistent with the requirements of section 9802 and section 2705 of the  PHS Act (incorporated by reference into section 9815).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No discrimination in favor of highly compensated individuals.  Neither the limited wraparound coverage, nor any other group health plan  coverage offered by the plan sponsor, fails to comply with section 2716  of the PHS Act (incorporated by reference into section 9815) or fails to  be excludible from income for any individual due to the application of  section 105(h) (as applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(1)</em>  or (2) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> is  considered satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility for the limited wraparound coverage is limited to  employees who are reasonably determined at the time of enrollment to not  be full-time employees (and their dependents, as defined in Sec.  54.9801-2), or who are retirees (and their dependents, as defined in  Sec. 54.9801-2). For this purpose, full-time employees are employees  who are reasonably expected to work at least an average of 30 hours per  week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other group health plan coverage, not limited to excepted  benefits, is offered to the individuals eligible for the limited  wraparound coverage. Only individuals eligible for the other group  health plan coverage are eligible for the limited wraparound coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. For this purpose,  the term ``full-time employee'' means a ``full-time employee'' as  defined in Sec. 54.4980H-1(a)(21) who is not in a limited non- assessment period for certain employees (as defined in Sec. 54.4980H- 1(a)(26)). Moreover, if a plan or issuer providing limited wraparound  coverage takes reasonable steps to ensure that employers disclose to the  plan or issuer necessary information regarding their coverage offered  and contribution levels for 2013 or 2014 (as applicable), and for any  year in which limited wraparound coverage is offered, the plan or issuer  is permitted to rely on reasonable representations by employers  regarding this information, unless the plan or issuer has specific  knowledge to the contrary. Consistent with the reporting and evaluation  criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(E) of this section, the Office of  Personnel Management may verify that plans and issuers have reasonable  mechanisms in place to ensure that contributing employers meet these  standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The limited wraparound coverage is reviewed and approved by the  Office of Personnel Management, consistent with the reporting and  evaluation criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(E) of this section, to  provide benefits in conjunction with coverage under a Multi-State Plan  authorized under section 1334 of the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act. The Office of Personnel Management may revoke approval if it  determines that continued approval is inconsistent with the reporting  and evaluation criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> is considered satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> is considered  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the duration of the pilot program, as described in  paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(F) of this section, the employer's annual  aggregate contributions for both primary and limited wraparound coverage  are substantially the same as the employer's total contributions for  coverage offered to full-time employees in 2013 or 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Reporting--(1) Reporting by group health plans and group health  insurance issuers. A self-insured group health plan, or a health  insurance issuer, offering or proposing to   offer limited wraparound coverage in connection with Multi-State Plan  coverage pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(D)(2) of this section reports  to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in a form and manner  specified in guidance, information OPM reasonably requires to determine  whether the plan or issuer qualifies to offer such coverage or complies  with the applicable requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting by group health plan sponsors. The plan sponsor of a  group health plan offering limited wraparound coverage under paragraph  (c)(3)(vii) of this section, must report to the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), in a form and manner specified in guidance,  information HHS reasonably requires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Pilot program with sunset. The provisions of paragraph  (c)(3)(vii) of this section apply to limited wraparound coverage that is  first offered no earlier than January 1, 2016 and no later than December  31, 2018 and that ends no later than on the later of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date that is three years after the date limited wraparound  coverage is first offered; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date on which the last collective bargaining agreement  relating to the plan terminates after the date limited wraparound  coverage is first offered (determined without regard to any extension  agreed to after the date limited wraparound coverage is first offered).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
