It is therefore, the policy of the Bureau of Indian  Affairs to allow access to land records and title documents unless such  access would violate the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a or other law  restricting access to such records, or there are strong policy grounds  for denying access where such access is not required by the Freedom of  Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It shall be the policy of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs that, unless specifically authorized, monetary  considerations will not be disclosed insofar as leases of tribal land  are concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and the notice of routine users then in effect to determine  whether the information may be released without the written consent of  the person to whom it pertains.</p>
