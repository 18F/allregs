The application must be filed with an ETA application processing center. Incomplete applications will be denied. Applications filed and certified electronically must, upon receipt of the labor certification, be signed immediately by the employer in order to be valid. Applications submitted by mail must contain the original signature of the employer, alien, attorney, and/or agent when they are received by the application processing center.

The purpose of these personal identifiers is to allow the Department of Labor to associate a given electronic submission with a single, specific individual. Personal identifiers can not be issued to a company or business. Rather, a personal identifier can only be issued to specific individual. Any personal identifiers must be used solely by the individual to whom they are assigned and can not be used or transferred to any other individual. An individual assigned a personal identifier must take all reasonable steps to ensure that his or her personal identifier can not be compromised. If an individual assigned a personal identifier suspects, or becomes aware, that his or her personal identifier has been compromised or is being used by someone else, then the individual must notify the Department of Labor immediately of the incident and cease the electronic transmission of any further submissions under that personal identifier until such time as a new personal identifier is provided. Any electronic transmissions submitted with a personal identifier will be presumed to be a submission by the individual assigned that personal identifier. The Department of Labor's system will notify those making submissions of these requirements at the time of each submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Documentation supporting the application for labor certification should not be filed with the application, however in the event the Certifying Officer notifies the employer that its application is to be audited, the employer must furnish required supporting documentation prior to a final determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Processing.

Rejecting U.S. workers for lacking skills necessary to perform the duties involved in the occupation, where the U.S. workers are capable of acquiring the skills during a reasonable period of on-the-job training is not a lawful job-related reason for rejection of the U.S. workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Job duties and requirements. (1) The job opportunity's requirements, unless adequately documented as arising from business necessity, must be those normally required for the occupation and must not exceed the Specific Vocational Preparation level assigned to the occupation as shown in the O*NET Job Zones.

The employer can not require domestic worker applicants to possess training and/or experience beyond what the alien possessed at the time of hire unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The alien gained the experience while working for the employer, including as a contract employee, in a position not substantially comparable to the position for which certification is being sought, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer can demonstrate that it is no longer feasible to train a worker to qualify for the position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In evaluating whether the alien beneficiary satisfies the employer's actual minimum requirements, DOL will not consider any education or training obtained by the alien beneficiary at the employer's expense unless the employer offers similar training to domestic worker applicants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (i):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``employer'' means an entity with the same Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN), provided it meets the definition of an employer at Sec. 656.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A ``substantially comparable'' job or position means a job or position requiring performance of the same job duties more than 50 percent of the time. This requirement can be documented by furnishing position descriptions, the percentage of time spent on

the various duties, organization charts, and payroll records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Conditions of employment. (1) Working conditions must be normal to the occupation in the area and industry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Working conditions must be normal to the occupation in the area and industry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Live-in requirements are acceptable for household domestic service workers only if the employer can demonstrate the requirement is essential to perform, in a reasonable manner, the job duties as described by the employer and there are not cost-effective alternatives to a live-in household requirement. Mere employer assertions do not constitute acceptable documentation. For example, a live-in requirement could be supported by documenting two working parents and young children in the household, and/or the existence of erratic work schedules requiring frequent travel and a need to entertain business associates and clients on short notice. Depending upon the situation, acceptable documentation could consist of travel vouchers, written estimates of costs of alternatives such as babysitters, or a detailed listing of the frequency and length of absences of the employer from the home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Layoffs. (1) If there has been a layoff by the employer applicant in the area of intended employment within 6 months of filing an application involving the occupation for which certification is sought or in a related occupation, the employer must document it has notified and considered all potentially qualified laid off (employer applicant) U.S. workers of the job opportunity involved in the application and the results of the notification and consideration.

A layoff shall be considered any involuntary separation of one or more employees without cause or prejudice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (k)(1) of this section, a related occupation is any occupation that requires workers to perform a majority of the essential duties involved in the occupation for which certification is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Alien influence and control over job opportunity. If the employer is a closely held corporation or partnership in which the alien has an ownership interest, or if there is a familial relationship between the stockholders, corporate officers, incorporators, or partners, and the alien, or if the alien is one of a small number of employees, the employer in the event of an audit must be able to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide job opportunity, i.e., the job is available to all U.S. workers, and must provide to the Certifying Officer, the following supporting documentation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, business license or similar documents that establish the business entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A list of all corporate/company officers and shareholders/partners of the corporation/firm/business, their titles and positions in the business' structure, and a description of the relationships to each other and to the alien beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The financial history of the corporation/company/partnership, including the total investment in the business entity and the amount of investment of each officer, incorporator/partner and the alien beneficiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The name of the business' official with primary responsibility for interviewing and hiring applicants for positions within the organization and the name(s) of the business' official(s) having control or influence over hiring decisions involving the position for which labor certification is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the alien is one of 10 or fewer employees, the employer must document any family relationship between the employees and the alien.</p>
