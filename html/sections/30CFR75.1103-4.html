                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective December 31, 2009, automatic fire sensor and warning  device systems that use carbon monoxide sensors shall provide  identification of fire along all belt conveyors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carbon monoxide sensors shall be installed at the following  locations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not more than 100 feet downwind of each belt drive unit, each  tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up. If the belt drive,  tailpiece, and/or take-up for a single transfer point are installed  together in the same air course, and the distance between the units is  less than 100 feet, they may be monitored with one sensor downwind of  the last component. If the distance between the units exceeds 100 feet,  additional sensors are required downwind of each belt drive unit, each  tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not more than 100 feet downwind of each section loading point;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Along the belt entry so that the spacing between sensors does  not exceed 1,000 feet. Where air velocities are less than 50 feet per  minute, spacing must not exceed 350 feet; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The mine operator shall indicate the locations of all carbon  monoxide sensors on the mine maps required by Sec. Sec. 75.1200 and  75.1505 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where used, sensors responding to radiation, smoke, gases, or  other indications of fire, shall be spaced at regular intervals to  provide protection equivalent to carbon monoxide sensors, and installed  within the time specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the distance from the tailpiece at loading points to the  first outby sensor reaches the spacing requirements in Sec. 75.1103- 4(a)(1)(iii), an additional sensor shall be installed and put in  operation within 24 production shift hours. When sensors of the kind  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are used, they shall be  installed and put in operation within 24 production shift hours after  the equivalent distance which has been established for the sensor from  the tailpiece at loading points to the first outby sensor is first  reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall be  installed so   as to minimize the possibility of damage from roof falls and the moving  belt and its load. Sensors must be installed near the center in the  upper third of the entry, in a manner that does not expose personnel  working on the system to unsafe conditions. Sensors must not be located  in abnormally high areas or in other locations where air flow patterns  do not permit products of combustion to be carried to the sensors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Infrared, ultraviolet, and other sensors whose effectiveness is  impaired by contamination shall be protected from dust, dirt, and  moisture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The voltage of automatic fire sensor and warning device systems  shall not exceed 120 volts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> (1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an unplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an  examination for hot rollers and fire in the operating belts of a  conveyor system shall be completed within 2 hours after the belt has  stopped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a preplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an  examination for hot rollers and fire on the operating belts of a  conveyor system may commence not more than 30 minutes before the belts  are stopped and shall be completed within 2 hours after the examination  is commenced, or the examination shall be commenced when the belts are  stopped and completed within 2 hours after the belts are stopped.
