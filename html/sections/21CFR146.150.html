                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Canned concentrated orange juice is the food that complies with  the requirements of composition, definition of dilution ratio, and  labeling of ingredients prescribed for frozen concentrated orange juice  by Sec. 146.146, except that it is not frozen and it is sealed in  containers and so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, so  as to prevent spoilage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The name of the food when concentrated to a dilution ratio of 3  plus 1 is ``Canned concentrated orange juice'' or ``Canned orange juice  concentrate''. The name of the food when concentrated to a dilution  ratio greater than 3 plus 1 is ``Canned concentrated orange juice, ---- -- plus 1'' or ``Canned orange juice concentrate, ------ plus 1'', the  blank being filled in with the whole number showing the dilution ratio;  for example, ``Canned orange juice concentrate, 4 plus 1''. However,  where the label bears directions for making 1 quart of single-strength  diluted product (or multiples of a quart) the blank in the name may be  filled in with a mixed number; for example, ``Canned orange juice  concentrate, 4\1/3\ plus 1''. For containers larger than 1 pint, the  dilution ratio in the name may be replaced by the concentration of  orange juice soluble solids in degrees Brix; for example, a 62 Brix  concentrate in 1-gallon cans may be named on the label ``canned  concentrated orange juice, 62 Brix''. If the food does not purport to  be frozen concentrated orange juice, the word ``canned'' may be omitted  from the name.  [42 FR 14433, Mar. 15, 1977, as amended at 58 FR 2881, Jan. 6, 1993]</p>
