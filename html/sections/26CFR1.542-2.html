                                Sec. 1.542-2  Gross income requirement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To meet the gross income requirement it is necessary that at least  80 percent of the total gross income of the   corporation for the taxable year be personal holding company income as  defined in section 543 and Secs. 1.543-1 and 1.543-2. For the definition  of gross income see section 61 and Secs. 1.61-1 through 1.61-14. Under  such provisions gross income is not necessarily synonymous with gross  receipts. Further, in the case of transactions in stocks and securities  and in commodities transactions, gross income for personal holding  company tax purposes shall include only the excess of gains over losses  from such transactions. See section 543(b), paragraph (b) (5) and (6) of  Sec. 1.543-1 and Sec. 1.543-2. For determining the character of the  amount includible in gross income under section 951(a), see paragraph  (a) of Sec. 1.951-1.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6795, 30 FR  934, Jan. 29, 1965]</p>
