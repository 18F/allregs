                            <p class="depth0">Within such time as may be set forth in the order, the agency head shall file a report with the Director detailing the corrective action taken. If corrective action cannot be accomplished within that time, the agency head shall submit a plan of corrective action for approval by the Director providing for appropriate status reports and notification of compliance. In either case, if the agency report or plan is deemed satisfactory, the Director will so inform the agency head. If the agency report or plan is insufficient, but only in minor respects, the Director may inform the agency head of the adjustments needed to bring the report or plan into compliance and a timeframe therefor; otherwise, the procedures under Sec. 2638.404 of this subpart will be invoked.</p>
