The maximum term of a lease approved under 25 U.S.C. 415(a) may not exceed 50 years (consisting of an initial term not to exceed 25 years and one renewal not to exceed 25 years), unless a Federal statute provides for a longer maximum term (e.g., 25 U.S.C. 415(a) allows for a maximum term of 99 years for certain tribes), a different initial term, renewal term, or number of renewals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For tribal land, we will defer to the tribe's determination that the lease term, including any renewal, is reasonable. For individually owned Indian land, we will review the lease term, including any renewal, to ensure it is reasonable, given the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose of the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Type of financing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Level of investment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The lease may not be extended by holdover.</p>
