                                Sec. 1.162-19  Capital contributions to Federal National Mortgage
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The initial holder of stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) which is issued pursuant to section 303(c) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C., section 1718) in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, shall treat the excess, if any, of the issuance price (the amount of capital contributions evidenced by a share of stock) over the fair market value of the stock as of the issue date of such stock as an ordinary and necessary business expense paid or incurred during the year in which occurs the date of issuance of the stock. To the extent that a sale to FNMA of mortgage paper gives rise to the issuance of a share of FNMA stock during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, such sale is to be treated in a manner consistent with the purpose for, and the legislative intent underlying the enactment of, the provisions of section 8, Act of September 14, 1960 (Pub. L. 86-779, 74 Stat. 1003). Thus, for the purpose of determining an initial holder's gain or loss from the sale to FNMA of mortgage paper, with respect to which a share of FNMA stock is issued in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959 (irrespective of when the sale is made), the amount realized by the initial holder from the sale of the mortgage paper is the amount of the ``FNMA purchase price''. The ``FNMA purchase price'' is the gross amount of the consideration agreed upon between FNMA and the initial holder for the purchase of the mortgage paper, without regard to any deduction therefrom as, for example, a deduction representing a capital contribution or a purchase or marketing fee. The date of issuance of the stock is the date which appears on the stock certificates of the initial holder as the date of issue. The initial holder is the original purchaser who is issued stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association pursuant to section 303(c) of the Act, and who appears on the books of FNMA as the initial holder. In determining the period for which the initial holder has held such stock, such period shall begin with the date of issuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, a banking institution which reports its income on a calendar year basis, sold mortgage paper with an outstanding principal balance of $12,500 to FNMA on October 17, 1960. The FNMA purchase price was $11,500. A's basis for the mortgage paper was $10,500. In accordance with the terms of the contract, FNMA deducted $375 ($250 representing capital contribution and $125 representing purchase and marketing fee) from

the amount of the purchase price. FNMA credited A's account with the amount of the capital contribution. A stock certificate evidencing two shares of FNMA common stock of $100 par value was mailed to A and FNMA deducted $200 from A's account, leaving a net balance of $50 in such account. The stock certificate, bearing an issue date of November 1, 1960, was received by A on November 7, 1960. The fair market value of a share of FNMA stock on October 17, 1960, was $65, on November 1, 1960, was $67, and on November 7, 1960, was $68. A may deduct $66 the difference between the issuance price ($200) and the fair market value ($134) of the two shares of stock on the date of issuance (November 1, 1960), as a business expense for the taxable year 1960. The basis of each share of stock issued as of November 1, 1960 will be $67. See section 1054 and Sec. 1.1054-1. A's gain from the sale of the mortgage paper is $875 computed as follows:
Amount realized in FNMA purchase price........................   $11,500A's basis in mortgage paper.........................   $10,500Purchase and marketing fee..........................       125</p><p class="depth2">----------</p><p class="depth2">........    10,625</p><p class="depth2">---------Gain on sale..................................................       875</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), and, in addition, that A sold to FNMA on December 15, 1960, additional mortgage paper having an outstanding principal balance of $12,500. FNMA deducted from the FNMA purchase price $250 representing capital contribution and credited A's account with this amount. A then had a total credit of $300 to his account consisting of the $50 balance from the transaction described in Example (1) and $250 from the December 15th transaction. A stock certificate evidencing three shares of FNMA common stock of $100 par value was mailed to A and FNMA deducted $300 from A's account. The stock certificate, bearing an issue date of January 1, 1961, was received by A on January 9, 1961. The fair market value of a share of FNMA stock on January 1, 1961, was $69. A may deduct $93, the difference between the issuance price ($300) and the fair market value ($207) of the three shares of stock on the date of issuance (January 1, 1961), as a business expense for the taxable year 1961. The gain or loss on the sale of mortgage paper on December 15, 1960, is reportable for the taxable year 1960.
