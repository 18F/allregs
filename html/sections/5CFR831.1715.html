                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A phased retiree is deemed to be a full-time employee for the  purpose of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 (related to health  benefits), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(i). The normal rules governing  health benefits premiums for part-time employees in 5 U.S.C. 8906(b)(3)  do not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A phased retiree is deemed to be receiving basic pay at the rate  applicable to a full-time employee holding the same position for the  purpose of determining a phased retiree's annual rate of basic pay used  in calculating premiums (employee withholdings and agency contributions)  and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87 and 5 CFR part 870 (dealing with  life insurance), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n). The deemed full-time  schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting  in a 40-hour workweek. Only basic pay for hours within the deemed full- time schedule will be considered, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n) and  the definition of ``full-time'' in Sec. 831.1702. Any premium pay  creditable as basic pay for life insurance purposes under 5 CFR 870.204  for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an  employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty  pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19  U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's  deemed annual rate of basic pay under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A phased retiree may not be appointed to more than one position  at the same time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A phased retiree may move to another position in the agency or  another agency during phased retirement status only if the change would  not result in a change in the working percentage. To move to another  agency during phased retirement status and continue phased employment  and phased retirement status, the phased retiree must submit a written  and signed request and obtain the signed written approval, in accordance  with Sec. 831.1713(a)(1) and (2), of the authorized agency official of  the agency to which the phased retiree is moving. Notwithstanding the  provisions of Sec. 831.1714, if the authorized agency official approves  the request, the phased retiree's phased employment and phased  retirement status will continue without interruption at the agency to  which the phased retiree moves. If the authorized agency official at the  agency to which the phased retiree moves does not approve the request,  phased employment and phased retirement status terminates in accordance  with Sec. 831.1722(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A phased retiree may be detailed to another position or agency,  subject to 5 CFR part 300, subpart C, if the working percentage of the  position to which detailed is the same as the working percentage of the  phased retiree's position of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A retirement-eligible employee who makes an election under this  subpart may not elect an alternative annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8343a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the employee's election of phased retirement status becomes  effective, the employee is barred from electing phased retirement status  again. Ending phased retirement status or entering full retirement  status does not create a new opportunity for the individual to elect  phased retirement status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as otherwise expressly provided by law or regulation, a  phased retiree is treated as any other employee on a part-time tour of  duty for all other purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A phased retiree may not be assigned hours of work in excess  of the officially established part-time schedule (reflecting the working  percentage), except under the conditions specified in paragraph (h)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An authorized agency official may order or approve a phased  retiree to perform hours of work in excess of the officially established  part-time schedule only in rare and exceptional circumstances meeting  all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The work is necessary to respond to an emergency posing a  significant,   immediate, and direct threat to life or property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The authorized agency official determines that no other  qualified employee is available to perform the required work;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The phased retiree is relieved from performing excess work as  soon as reasonably possible (e.g., by management assignment of work to  other employees); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When an emergency situation can be anticipated in advance,  agency management made advance plans to minimize any necessary excess  work by the phased retiree.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employing agencies must inform each phased retiree and his or  her supervisor of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The limitations on hours worked in excess of the officially  established part-time schedule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirement to maintain records documenting that exceptions  met all required conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fact that, by law and regulation, any basic pay received  for hours outside the employee's officially established part-time work  schedule (as described in Sec. 831.1712(a)(1) and (b)) is subject to  retirement deductions and agency contributions, in accordance with 5  U.S.C. 8336a(d), but is not used in computing retirement benefits; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The fact that, by law and regulation, any premium pay received  for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule, that would  otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime  pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), will not be subject to retirement deductions  or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d), and that  any such premium pay received will not be included in computing  retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employing agencies must maintain records documenting that  exceptions granted under paragraph (h)(2) of this section meet the  required conditions. These records must be retained for at least 6 years  and be readily available to auditors. OPM may require periodic agency  reports on the granting of exceptions and of any audit findings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If OPM finds that an agency (or subcomponent) is granting  exceptions that are not in accordance with the requirements of this  paragraph (h), OPM may administratively withdraw the agency's (or  subcomponent's) authority to grant exceptions and require OPM approval  of any exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If OPM finds that a phased retiree has been working a  significant amount of excess hours beyond the officially established  part-time schedule to the degree that the intent of the phased  retirement law is being undermined, OPM may require that the agency end  the individual's phased retirement by unilateral action, notwithstanding  the normally established methods of ending phased retirement. This  finding does not need to be based on a determination that the granted  exceptions failed to meet the required conditions in paragraph (h)(2) of  this section. With the ending of an individual's phased retirement, that  individual must be returned to regular employment status on the same  basis as a person making an election under Sec. 831.1721--unless that  individual elects to fully retire as provided under Sec. 831.1731.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A phased retiree must be compensated for excess hours of work in  accordance with the normally applicable pay rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the  full-time schedule that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement,  such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), is not  subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance  with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A phased retiree is deemed to be an annuitant for the purpose of  subpart S of 5 CFR part 831.</p><p class="depth4">Returning to Regular Employment Status</p>
