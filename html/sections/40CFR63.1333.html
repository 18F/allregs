                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>  through (5) of this section and the additions specified in paragraphs  (b) through (d) of this section. Representative conditions exclude  periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or  an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance  tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record  the process information that is necessary to document operating  conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to  support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request,  the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such  records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance  tests. Sections 63.1314 through 63.1330 also contain specific testing  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this  section to occur.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of  Compliance Status is due, according to Sec.  63.1335(e)(5); or the 6- month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3  months after the performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or  operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for  sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make  product in excess of demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements in Sec.  63.1335(e)(5) shall apply instead of  the references in Sec.  63.7(g) to the Notification of Compliance Status  requirements in Sec.  63.9(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> are not  required, Sec.  63.7(h)(4)(ii) is not applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the  intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 days before the  performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity  to have an observer present during the test. If after 30 days notice for  an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to  operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance  test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the  Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test  date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the  rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled  date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days  after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for  the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status),  rather than according to the time periods in Sec.  63.7(a)(2) of subpart  A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. During  periods of startup or shutdown, as an alternative to using Equation 49  of this subpart, the owner or operator may divide the emission rate of  total organic HAP or TOC during startup or shutdown by the rate of  polymer produced from the most recent performance test associated with a  production rate greater than zero to comply with the emission limit.
