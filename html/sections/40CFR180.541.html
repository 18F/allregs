                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A tolerance of 0.1 part per million is established for residues of the insecticide propetamphos, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on food or feed commodities when present therein as a result of the treatment of food- or feed-handling establishments with propetamphos. Direct application shall be limited solely to spot and/or crack and crevice treatment in food- or feed-handling establishments where food or feed and food or feed products are held, processed, prepared, served, or sold. Spray and dust concentrations shall be limited to a maximum of 1 percent active ingredient. For crack and crevice treatment, equipment capable of delivering a dust or a pin-stream of spray directly into cracks and crevices shall be used. For spot treatment, a coarse, low-pressure spray shall be used to avoid contamination of food, feed, or food-contact/feed-contact surfaces. Compliance with the tolerance level specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only propetamphos, 1-methylethyl-(2E)-3-((ethylamino)methoxyphosphinothioyl)oxy)-2-butenoate, in or on the commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 18 emergency exemptions.
