If an assisted family moves out of  the unit, the owner may keep the housing assistance payment payable for  the calendar month when the family moves out (``move-out month'').

Any vacancy payment may cover only the  period the unit remains vacant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA may make vacancy payments to the owner only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner gives the PHA prompt, written notice certifying that  the family has vacated the unit and containing the date when the family  moved out (to the best of the owner's knowledge and belief);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner certifies that the vacancy is not the fault of the  owner and that the unit was vacant during the period for which payment  is claimed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner certifies that it has taken every reasonable action  to minimize the likelihood and length of vacancy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The owner provides any additional information required and  requested by the PHA to verify that the owner is entitled to the vacancy  payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner must submit a request for vacancy payments in the form  and manner required by the PHA and must provide any information or  substantiation required by the PHA to determine the amount of any  vacancy payment.</p>
