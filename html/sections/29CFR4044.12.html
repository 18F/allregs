                                Sec. 4044.12  Priority category 2 benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. The benefits in priority category 2 are  participants' accrued benefits derived from mandatory employee  contributions, whether to be paid as an annuity benefit with a pre- retirement death benefit that returns mandatory employee contributions  or, if a participant so elects under the terms of the plan and subpart A  of part 4022 of this chapter, as a lump sum benefit. Benefits are  primarily basic-type benefits although nonbasic-type benefits may also  be included as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonbasic-type benefits. If a participant elects to receive a  lump sum benefit and if the value of the lump sum benefit exceeds the  value of the basic-type benefit in priority category 2 determined with  respect to the participant, the excess is a nonbasic-type benefit. There  is no nonbasic-type benefit in priority category 2 for a participant who  does not elect to receive a lump sum benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. The  form of the annuity benefit (e.g., straight life annuity, joint and  survivor annuity, cash refund annuity, etc.) is the form that the  participant or beneficiary is entitled to on the termination date. If  the participant does not have a nonforfeitable right to a benefit, other  than the return of his or her mandatory contributions in a lump sum, the  annuity form of benefit is the form the participant would be entitled to  if the participant had a nonforfeitable right to an annuity benefit  under the plan on the termination date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accumulated mandatory employee contributions. Subject to any  addition for the cost of ancillary benefits plus interest, as provided  in the following sentence, the amount of the accumulated mandatory  employee contributions for each participant is the participant's total  nonforfeitable mandatory employee contributions remaining in the plan on  the termination date plus interest, if any, under the plan provisions.  Mandatory employee contributions, if any, used after the effective date  of the minimum vesting standards in section 203 of ERISA and section 411  of the Code for costs or to provide ancillary benefits such as life  insurance or health insurance, plus interest under the plan provisions,  shall be added to the contributions that remain in the plan to determine  the accumulated mandatory employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest rates and conversion factors. The interest rates and  conversion factors used in the administration of the plan shall be used  to convert a participant's accumulated mandatory contributions to the  annuity form of benefit. In the absence of plan rules and factors, the  interest rates and conversion factors established by the IRS for  allocation of accrued benefits between employer and employee  contributions under the provisions of section 204(c) of ERISA and  section 411(c) of the Code shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum accrued benefit. The annuity benefit derived from  mandatory employee contributions may not be less than the minimum  accrued benefit under the provisions of section 204(c) of ERISA and  section 411(c) of the Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of this section are used to determine the portion of the accrued  benefit derived from the employee's contributions and, if any, the  portion of the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annuity benefit and pre-retirement death benefit. The annuity  benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit assigned to priority  category 2 with respect to a participant are determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The annuity benefit is the benefit computed under paragraph (b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for adjustments necessary to meet the minimum lump sum  requirements as hereafter provided, the pre-retirement death benefit is  the benefit under the plan that returns all or a portion of the  participant's mandatory employee contributions upon the death of the  participant before retirement. A benefit that became payable in a single  installment (or substantially so) because the participant died before  the termination date is a liability of the plan within the meaning of  Sec. 4044.3(a) and should not be assigned to priority category 2. A  benefit payable upon a participant's death that is included in the  annuity form of the benefit derived from mandatory employee  contributions (e.g., the survivor's portion of a joint and survivor  annuity or the cash refund portion of a cash refund annuity) is assigned  to priority category 2 as part of the annuity benefit under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section and is not assigned as a death benefit. The  pre-retirement death benefit may not be less than the minimum lump sum  required upon withdrawal of mandatory employee contributions by the IRS  under section 204(c) of ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lump sum benefit. Except for adjustments necessary to meet the  minimum lump sum requirements as hereafter provided, if a participant  elects to receive a lump sum benefit under the provisions of the plan,  the amount of the benefit that is assigned to priority category 2 with  respect to the participant is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The combined value of the annuity benefit and the pre-retirement  death benefit determined according to paragraph (c)(1) (which  constitutes the basic-type benefit) plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount, if any, of the participant's accumulated mandatory  employee contributions that exceeds the combined value of the annuity  benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit (which constitutes the  nonbasic-type benefit), but not more than</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of the participant's accumulated mandatory  contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, accumulated  mandatory contributions means the contributions with interest, if any,  payable under plan provisions to the participant or beneficiary on  termination of the plan or, in the absence of such provisions, the  amount that is payable if the participant withdrew his or her  contributions on the termination date. The lump sum benefit may not be  less than the minimum lump required by the IRS under section 204(c) of  ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code upon withdrawal of mandatory  employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for benefit resulting from rollover amounts. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Mandatory employee contributions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)  through (3) of this section, in the case of a benefit resulting from  rollover amounts, the accrued benefit derived from mandatory employee  contributions is determined using the interest rates and conversion  factors under section 411(c)(2)(B) and (C) of the Code for purposes of  computing an employee's accrued benefit derived from the employee's  contributions. The annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit,  as determined on this basis, is the benefit resulting from rollover  amounts in priority category 2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employer contributions. Any portion of a participant's accrued  benefit resulting from rollover amounts that is in excess of the accrued  benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions determined in  accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (i.e., the accrued  benefit derived from employer contributions) is a guaranteeable benefit  in priority category 3, priority category 4, or priority category 5, as  applicable under this part.
