                            <p class="depth0">Yes. This subpart contains provisions in Sec. Sec.  1.670 through 1.674 that would collect information from the public. It therefore requires approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. (PRA). According to the PRA, a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number that indicates OMB approval. OMB has reviewed the information collection in this rule and approved it under OMB control number 1094-0001.

Sec.  1c.102  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Department or agency head means the head of any federal department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department or agency to whom authority has been delegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Institution means any public or private entity or agency (including federal, state, and other agencies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Legally authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour requirements administered by the Department of Labor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifiable private information.
Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. ``Private information'' includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> IRB means an institutional review board established in accord with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and federal requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Certification means the official notification by the institution to the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in accordance with an approved assurance.



Sec.  1c.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conductedor supported by any Federal Department or Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this policy and which is conducted or supported by a federal department or agency shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements set forth in this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for federalwide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement of principles governing the institution in the discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived under Sec.  1c.101 (b) or (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution; for example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in accord with Sec.  1c.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership shall be reported to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this

policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any suspension or termination of IRB approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one. The department or agency head may limit the period during which any particular approved assurance or class of approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certification is required when the research is supported by a federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under Sec.  1c.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the assurance and by Sec.  1c.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by the department or agency to which the application or proposal is submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec.  1c.103 of the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the IRB.

Sec.  1c.107  IRB membership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No

IRB may consist entirely of members of one profession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> An IRB may, at its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


Sec.  1c.108  IRB functions and operations.</p><p class="depth0">In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in Sec.  1c.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec.  1c.103(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see Sec.  1c.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.


Sec.  1c.109  IRB review of research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part of informed consent is in accordance with Sec.  1c.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in Sec.  1c.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with Sec.  1c.117.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.

Sec.  1c.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds ofresearch involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changesin approved research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either or both of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minor changes in previously approved research during the period (of

one year or less) for which approval is authorized.
Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec.  1c.108(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have been approved under the procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.

Sec.  1c.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by Sec.  1c.116.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with, and to the extent required by Sec.  1c.117.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.


Sec.  1c.112  Review by institution.</p><p class="depth0">Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


Sec.  1c.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.</p><p class="depth0">An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval

shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

Sec.  1c.114  Cooperative research.</p><p class="depth0">Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy. With the approval of the department or agency head, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


Sec.  1c.115  IRB records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records of continuing review activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the investigators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A list of IRB members in the same detail as described is Sec.  1c.103(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in Sec. Sec.  1c.103(b)(4) and 1c.103(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as required by Sec.  1c.116(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research which is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the department or agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

Sec.  1c.117  Documentation of informed consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the consent form may be either of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by Sec.  1c.116. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by Sec.  1c.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.</p><p class="depth0">In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the research.

Sec.  1c.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans forinvolvement of human subjects.</p><p class="depth0">Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an IRB before an award may be made. However, except for research exempted or waived under Sec.  1c.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency.


Sec.  1c.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involvinghuman subjects.</p><p class="depth0">In the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving

human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency, and final approval given to the proposed change by the department or agency.


Sec.  1c.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposalsfor research to be conducted or supported by a Federal Department orAgency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the department or agency through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate.
