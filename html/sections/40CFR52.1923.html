                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to each owner or operator, or successive owners or operators, of the coal burning equipment designated as: Units 4 or 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 or 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance Dates. Compliance with the requirements of this section is required within five years of the effective date of this rule unless otherwise indicated by compliance dates contained in specific provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. All terms used in this part but not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the CAA and in parts 51 and 60 of this chapter. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">24-hour period means the period of time between 12:01 a.m. and 12 midnight.</p><p class="depth2">Air pollution control equipment includes selective catalytic control units, baghouses, particulate or gaseous scrubbers, and any other apparatus utilized to control emissions of regulated air contaminants that would be emitted to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2">Boiler-operating-day means any 24- hour period between 12:00 midnight and

the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time at the steam generating unit.</p><p class="depth2">Daily average means the arithmetic average of the hourly values measured in a 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth2">Heat input means heat derived from combustion of fuel in a unit and does not include the heat input from preheated combustion air, recirculated flue gases, or exhaust gases from other sources. Heat input shall be calculated in accordance with 40 CFR part 75.</p><p class="depth2">Owner or Operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises any of the coal burning equipment designated as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unit 4 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unit 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unit 1 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Unit 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant.</p><p class="depth4">Regional Administrator means the Regional Administrator of EPA Region 6 or his/her authorized representative.</p><p class="depth4">Unit means one of the coal fired boilers covered under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emissions Limitations.</p><p class="depth2">SO2 emission limit. The individual sulfur dioxide emission limit for a unit shall be 0.06 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) as averaged over a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day period. For each unit, SO2 emissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO2. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SO2 from that day and the preceding 29 boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SO2 by the sum of the heat input during the same 30 boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO2. If a valid SO2 pounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SO2 pounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Testing and monitoring. (1) No later than the compliance date in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO2 on Units 4 and 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and Appendix B of Part 60. The owner or operator shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO2 shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than the compliance date in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO2 on Units 4 and 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and Appendix B of Part 60. The owner or operator shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO2 shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuous emissions monitoring shall apply during all periods of operation of the coal burning equipment, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments. Continuous monitoring systems for measuring SO2 and diluent gas shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling system, and recertification events. When valid SO2 pounds per hour, or SO2 pounds per million Btu emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained by using other monitoring systems approved by the EPA to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24 hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements. Unless otherwise stated all

requests, reports, submittals, notifications, and other communications to the Regional Administrator required by this section shall be submitted, unless instructed otherwise, to the Director, Multimedia Planning and Permitting Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, to the attention of Mail Code: 6PD, at 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75202-2733. For each unit subject to the emissions limitation in this section and upon completion of the installation of CEMS as required in this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each emissions limit in this section, comply with the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for CEMS compliance monitoring in 40 CFR 60.7(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each day, provide the total SO2 emitted that day by each emission unit. For any hours on any unit where data for hourly pounds or heat input is missing, identify the unit number and monitoring device that did not produce valid data that caused the missing hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Equipment Operations. At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit or requirement that occur due to a malfunction shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission limit.
