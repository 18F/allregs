                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of this subpart is to establish  standards and criteria for the use of all types of compensatory  mitigation, including on-site and off-site permittee-responsible  mitigation, mitigation banks, and in-lieu fee mitigation to offset  unavoidable impacts to waters of the United States authorized through  the issuance of permits by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)  pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344). This  subpart implements section 314(b) of the 2004 National Defense  Authorization Act (Pub. L. 108-136), which directs that the standards  and criteria shall, to the maximum extent practicable, maximize  available credits and opportunities for mitigation, provide for regional  variations in wetland conditions, functions, and values, and apply  equivalent standards and criteria to each type of compensatory  mitigation. This subpart is intended to further clarify mitigation  requirements established under the Corps and EPA regulations at 33 CFR  part 320 and this part, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart has been jointly developed by the Secretary of the  Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and the Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency. From time to time guidance on  interpreting and implementing this subpart may be prepared jointly by  EPA and the Corps at the national or regional level. No modifications to  the basic application, meaning, or intent of this subpart will be made  without further joint rulemaking by the Secretary of the Army, acting  through the Chief of Engineers and the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Administrative  Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This subpart does not alter the circumstances  under which compensatory mitigation is required or the definition of  ``waters of the United States,'' which is provided at Sec. 230.3(s).  Use of resources as compensatory mitigation that are not otherwise  subject to regulation under section 404 of the Clean Water Act does not  in and of itself make them subject to such regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sequencing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nothing in this section affects the requirement  that all DA permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act comply  with applicable provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to these requirements, the district engineer will issue  an individual section 404 permit only upon a determination that the  proposed discharge complies with applicable provisions of 40 CFR part  230, including those which require the permit applicant to take all  appropriate and practicable steps to avoid and minimize adverse impacts  to waters of the United States. Practicable means available and capable  of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology,  and logistics in light of overall project purposes. Compensatory  mitigation for unavoidable impacts may be required to ensure that an  activity requiring a section 404 permit complies with the Section  404(b)(1) Guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts may be required  to ensure that an activity requiring a section 404 permit complies with  the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. During the 404(b)(1) Guidelines  compliance analysis, the district engineer may determine that a DA  permit for the proposed activity cannot be issued because of the lack of  appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation options.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accounting for regional variations. Where appropriate, district  engineers shall account for regional characteristics of aquatic resource  types, functions and services when determining performance standards and  monitoring requirements for compensatory mitigation projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relationship to other guidance documents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart  applies instead   of the ``Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of  Mitigation Banks,'' which was issued on November 28, 1995, the ``Federal  Guidance on the Use of In-Lieu Fee Arrangements for Compensatory  Mitigation Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of  the Rivers and Harbors Act,'' which was issued on November 7, 2000, and  Regulatory Guidance Letter 02-02, ``Guidance on Compensatory Mitigation  Projects for Aquatic Resource Impacts Under the Corps Regulatory Program  Pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the  Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899'' which was issued on December 24, 2002.  These guidance documents are no longer to be used as compensatory  mitigation policy in the Corps Regulatory Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, this subpart also applies instead of the provisions  relating to the amount, type, and location of compensatory mitigation  projects, including the use of preservation, in the February 6, 1990,  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Department of the Army and the  Environmental Protection Agency on the Determination of Mitigation Under  the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. All other provisions  of this MOA remain in effect.</p>
