As used in this section, ``transaction value'' means in the case of a sale, the sale price, and in the case of a lease, the value of the lease plus the residual value of the facility at the termination of the lease (i.e., the reproduction value or, if appropriate, an alternative use value).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The transaction value will be adjusted to account for the purchase or lease of other assets and the assumption of liabilities associated with the transaction. To determine the amount of Federal recovery, the adjusted value will be apportioned to the grant-aided assets by the ration of the remaining useful lifetime values of those assets to the sum of the remaining useful lifetime values of all assets not previously accounted for in adjusting the transaction value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A depreciated reproduction value will be established by calculating a reproduction value using construction cost indexes or current costs per square foot for construction, depending on which is more relevant to the type of construction associated with the grant. This reproduction value will then be adjusted by the ratio of the remaining useful life to the total useful life for the assets involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In calculating the recovery amount, the Secretary will include as Federal participation any grant assistance received by the facility under an authority listed in Sec.  124.701 and any assistance supplementary to that assistance received for the construction or modernization of the facility under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121, et seq.) or the Local Public Works Capital Development Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-369).</p>
