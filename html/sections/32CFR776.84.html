                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an ethics investigation is initiated, the covered  attorney concerned will be so notified, in writing, by the Rules  Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The covered attorney concerned will be provided written notice  of the following rights in connection with the ethics investigation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To request a hearing before the investigating officer (IO);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To inspect all evidence gathered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To present written or oral statements or materials for  consideration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To call witnesses at his or her own expense (local military  witnesses should be made available at no cost);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To be assisted by counsel (see paragraph (c) of this section);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To challenge the IO for cause (such challenges must be made in  writing and sent to the Rules Counsel via the challenged officer); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To waive any or all of these rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The covered attorney may be represented by counsel at the  hearing. Such counsel may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A civilian attorney retained at no expense to the Government;  or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a covered USG attorney, another USG attorney:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Detailed by the cognizant Naval Legal Service Office (NLSO), Law  Center, or Legal Service Support Section (LSSS); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requested by the covered attorney concerned, if such counsel is  attached to the cognizant NLSO, Law Center, LSSS, or to a Navy or Marine  Corps activity located within 100 miles of the hearing site at the time  of the scheduled hearing, and if such counsel is reasonably available,  as determined by the requested counsel's reporting senior in his or her  sole discretion. There is no right to detailed counsel if requested  counsel is made available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a hearing is requested, the IO will conduct the hearing after  reasonable notice to the covered attorney concerned. The hearing will  not be unreasonably delayed. The hearing is not adversarial in nature  and there is no right to subpoena witnesses. Rules of evidence do not  apply. The covered attorney concerned or his or her counsel may question  witnesses that appear. The proceedings shall be recorded but no  transcript of the hearing need be made. Evidence gathered during, or  subsequent to, the preliminary inquiry and such additional evidence as  may be offered by the covered attorney shall be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The IO may appoint and use such assistants as may be necessary  to conduct the ethics investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The IO shall prepare a report which summarizes the evidence, to  include information presented at any hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the IO believes that no violation has occurred or that the  violation is minor or technical in nature and warrants only corrective  counseling, then he or she may recommend that the file be closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the IO believes that a violation did occur, and that  corrective action greater than counseling is warranted, he or she shall  then recommend what further action is deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The IO shall forward the ethics investigation, including the  IO's recommendations, to the Rules Counsel, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases involving Navy or Marine Corps attorneys serving with  NLSC units, via Vice Commander, NLSC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases involving Navy attorneys serving with Marine Corps  units, via the Commandant of the Marine Corps (Attn: JA);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases involving Navy or Marine Corps attorneys serving in  subordinate Navy fleet or staff billets, via the fleet or staff judge  advocate attached to the appropriate second-echelon commander;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In cases involving members of the Navy-Marine Corps Trial  Judiciary, via the Trial Judiciary Chief Judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In cases involving Marine Corps attorneys serving in defense  billets, via   the Chief Defense Counsel of the Marine Corps;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In cases involving Marine Corps attorneys not serving in defense  counsel billets or in Navy units, via the OEGCMJ over the concerned  attorney; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In cases involving covered attorneys certified by the Judge  Advocates General/Chief Counsel of the other U.S. Armed Forces, via the  appropriate military service attorney discipline section of that U.S.  Armed Force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Rules Counsel shall review all ethics investigations. If the  report is determined by the Rules Counsel to be incomplete, the Rules  Counsel shall return it to the IO, or to another inquiry officer, for  further or supplemental inquiry. If the report is complete, then:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Rules Counsel determines, either consistent with the IO  recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the  investigation, that a violation of this part or Code of Judicial Conduct  has not occurred and that further action is not warranted, the Rules  Counsel shall close the file and notify the complainant, the covered  attorney concerned, and all officials previously provided copies of the  complaint. JAG(13) and/or JAR, as appropriate, will maintain copies of  all correspondence related to the closing of the file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Rules Counsel determines, either consistent with the IO  recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the  investigation, that a violation of this part or Code of Judicial Conduct  has occurred but that the violation is of a minor or technical nature,  then the Rules Counsel may determine that corrective counseling is  appropriate and close the file. The Rules Counsel shall report any such  decision to the JAG. The Rules Counsel shall ensure that the covered  attorney concerned receives appropriate counseling and shall notify the  complainant, the covered attorney concerned, and all officials  previously provided copies of the complaint that the file has been  closed. JAG(13) and/or JAR, as appropriate, will maintain copies of all  correspondence related to the closing of the file. The covered attorney  concerned is responsible, under these circumstances, to determine if his  or her Federal, state, or local licensing authority requires reporting  such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Rules Counsel believes, either consistent with the IO  recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the  investigation, that professional disciplinary action greater than  corrective counseling is warranted, the Rules Counsel shall forward the  investigation, with recommendations as to appropriate disposition, to  JAG.</p>
