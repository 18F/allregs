                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Commercial quota, recreational landing limits, research set- asides, and other specification measures. The Scup Monitoring Committee  shall recommend to the Demersal Species Committee of the MAFMC and the  ASMFC through the specifications process, for use in conjunction with  each ACL and ACT, a sector specific research set-aside, estimates of  sector-related discards, recreational harvest limit, and commercial  quota, along with other measures, as needed, that are projected to  ensure the sector-specific ACL for an upcoming fishing year or years  will not be exceeded. The measures to be considered by the Scup  Monitoring Committee are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of the maximum  allowed to achieve the specified exploitation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The commercial quota for each of the three periods specified in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section for research quota.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II periods,  including possession limits that result from potential rollover of quota  from Winter I to Winter II. The possession limit is the maximum quantity  of scup that is allowed to be landed within a 24-hour period (calendar  day).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Percent of landings attained at which the landing limit for the  Winter I period will be reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Minimum mesh size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 50 scup  to achieve the recreational harvest limit, set after the reduction for  research quota.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recreational minimum fish size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Recreational season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Restrictions on gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Season and area closures in the commercial fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Total allowable landings on an annual basis for a period not to  exceed 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the CV-based  performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/ obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer  sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or  observer set aside programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules  utilized by the Scup Monitoring Committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specification of fishing measures. The Demersal Species  Committee shall review the recommendations of the Scup Monitoring  Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the  Demersal Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures  necessary to assure that the specified ACLs will not be exceeded. The  MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting documentation, as  appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the  recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these  recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After such review,  NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement a  commercial quota, specifying the amount of quota allocated to each of  the three periods, possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II  periods, including possession limits that result from potential rollover  of quota from Winter I to Winter II, the percentage of landings attained  during the Winter I fishery at which the possession limits will be  reduced, a recreational harvest limit, and additional management  measures for the commercial fishery. If the Regional Administrator  determines that additional recreational measures are necessary to ensure  that the sector ACL will not be exceeded, he or she will publish a  proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement additional management  measures for the recreational fishery. After considering public comment,  the Regional Administrator will publish a final rule in the Federal  Register to implement annual measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distribution of commercial quota. (1) The annual commercial  quota will be allocated into three periods, based on the following  percentages:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Period                               Percent ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Winter I--January-April.......................................     45.11 Summer--May-October...........................................     38.95 Winter II--November-December..................................     15.94 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The commercial quotas for each period will each be distributed  to the coastal states from Maine through North Carolina on a coastwide  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Winter I and II commercial quota adjustment procedures. The  Regional Administrator will monitor the harvest of commercial quota for  the Winter I period based on dealer reports, state data, and other  available information and shall determine the total amount of scup  landed during the Winter I period. In any year that the Regional  Administrator determines that the landings of scup during Winter I are  less than the Winter I quota for that year, he/she shall increase,  through publication of a notification in the Federal Register, provided  such rule complies with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure  Act, the Winter II quota for that year by the amount of the Winter I  under-harvest. The Regional Administrator shall also adjust, through  publication of a notification in the Federal Register, the Winter II  possession limits consistent with the amount of the quota increase,  based on the possession limits established through the annual  specifications-setting process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).  [76 FR 60631, Sept. 29, 2011, as amended at 76 FR 81850, Dec. 29, 2011;  80 FR 37196, June 30, 2015]</p>
