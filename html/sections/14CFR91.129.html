                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise authorized or required by the ATC  facility having jurisdiction over the Class D airspace area, each person  operating an aircraft in Class D airspace must comply with the  applicable provisions of this section. In addition, each person must  comply with Sec. Sec. 91.126 and 91.127. For the purpose of this  section, the primary airport is the airport for which the Class D  airspace area is designated. A satellite airport is any other airport  within the Class D airspace area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deviations. An operator may deviate from any provision of this  section under the provisions of an ATC authorization issued by the ATC  facility having jurisdiction over the airspace concerned. ATC may  authorize a deviation on a continuing basis or for an individual flight,  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Communications. Each person operating an aircraft in Class D  airspace must meet the following two-way radio communications  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Arrival or through flight. Each person must establish two-way  radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the  case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air  traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain  those communications while within that airspace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Departing flight. Each person--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> From the primary airport or satellite airport with an operating  control tower must establish and maintain two-way radio communications  with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC while  operating in the Class D airspace area; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From a satellite airport without an operating control tower,  must establish and maintain two-way radio communications with the ATC  facility having jurisdiction over the Class D airspace area as soon as  practicable after departing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Communications failure. Each person who operates an aircraft in  a Class D airspace area must maintain two-way radio communications with  the ATC facility having jurisdiction over that area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot must  comply with Sec. 91.185 of the part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the aircraft radio fails in flight under VFR, the pilot in  command may operate that aircraft and land if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Weather conditions are at or above basic VFR weather minimums;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Visual contact with the tower is maintained; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A clearance to land is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minimum altitudes when operating to an airport in Class D  airspace. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless required by the applicable distance-from-cloud  criteria, each pilot operating a large or turbine-powered airplane must  enter the traffic pattern at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet above  the elevation of the airport and maintain at least 1,500 feet until  further descent is required for a safe landing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each pilot operating a large or turbine-powered airplane  approaching to land on a runway served by an instrument approach  procedure with vertical guidance, if the airplane is so equipped, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operate that airplane at an altitude at or above the glide path  between the published final approach fix and the decision altitude (DA),  or decision height (DH), as applicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If compliance with the applicable distance-from-cloud criteria  requires glide path interception closer in, operate that airplane at or  above the glide path, between the point of interception of glide path  and the DA or the DH.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each pilot operating an airplane approaching to land on a runway  served by a visual approach slope indicator must maintain an altitude at  or above the glide path until a lower altitude is necessary for a safe  landing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section do not prohibit  normal bracketing maneuvers above or below the glide path that are  conducted for the purpose of remaining on the glide path.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Approaches. Except when conducting a circling approach under  part 97 of this chapter or unless otherwise required by ATC, each pilot  must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circle the airport to the left, if operating an airplane; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft, if operating a  helicopter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Departures. No person may operate an aircraft departing from an  airport except in compliance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each pilot must comply with any departure procedures established  for that airport by the FAA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless otherwise required by the prescribed departure procedure  for that airport or the applicable distance from clouds criteria, each  pilot of a turbine-powered airplane and each pilot of a large airplane  must climb to an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface as rapidly as  practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Noise abatement. Where a formal runway use program has been  established by the FAA, each pilot of a large or turbine-powered  airplane assigned a noise abatement runway by ATC must use that runway.  However, consistent with the final authority of the pilot in command  concerning the safe operation of the aircraft as prescribed in  Sec. 91.3(a), ATC may assign a different runway if requested by the  pilot in the interest of safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Takeoff, landing, taxi clearance. No person may, at any airport  with an operating control tower, operate an aircraft on a runway or  taxiway, or take off or land an aircraft, unless an appropriate  clearance is received from ATC.
