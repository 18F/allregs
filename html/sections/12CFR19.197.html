                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipt of information. An individual, including any employee of  the OCC, who has reason to believe that an individual practicing before  the OCC in a representative capacity has engaged in any conduct that  would serve as a basis for censure, suspension or debarment under  Sec. 19.192, may make a report thereof and forward it to the OCC or to  such person as may be delegated responsibility for such matters by the  Comptroller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Censure without formal proceeding. Upon receipt of information  regarding an individual's qualification to practice before the OCC, the  Comptroller or the Comptroller's delegate may, after giving the  individual notice and opportunity to respond, censure such individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Institution of formal disciplinary proceeding. When the  Comptroller has reason to believe that any individual who practices  before the OCC in a representative capacity has engaged in conduct that  would serve as a basis for censure, suspension or debarment under  Sec. 19.192, the Comptroller may, after giving the individual notice and  opportunity to respond, institute a formal disciplinary proceeding  against such individual. The proceeding will be conducted pursuant to  Sec. 19.199 and initiated by a complaint which names the individual as a  respondent and is signed by the Comptroller or the Comptroller's  delegate. Except in cases of willfulness, or when time, the nature of  the proceeding, or the public interest do not permit, a proceeding under  this section may not be commenced until the respondent has been  informed, in writing, of the facts or conduct which warrant institution  of a proceeding and the respondent has been accorded the opportunity to  comply with all lawful requirements or take whatever action may be  necessary to remedy the conduct that is the basis for the commencement  of the proceeding.
