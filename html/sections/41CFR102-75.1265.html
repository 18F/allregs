Requests for extensions must be  strongly justified and approved by the appropriate GSA Regional  Administrator. For example, agencies may request an extension of time to  submit their formal transfer request if they are not promptly provided  GSA's estimate of FMV after submission of the initial expression of  interest. Agencies requesting extensions must also submit an agreement  accepting responsibility for providing and funding protection and  maintenance for the requested property during the period of the  extension until the property is transferred to the requesting agency or  the requesting agency notifies GSA that it is no longer interested in  the property. This assumption of protection and maintenance  responsibility also applies to extensions associated with a requesting  agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement  requirement (see Sec. 102-75.205).</p>
