                            <p class="depth0">Appeals Officer means the person designated by the Chairperson to  process appeals of denials of requests for CSB records under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth0">Business submitter means any person or entity which provides  confidential business information, directly or indirectly, to the CSB  and who has a proprietary interest in the information.</p><p class="depth0">Chairperson means the Chairperson of the CSB (including, in the  absence of a Chairperson, the Board Member supervising personnel  matters) or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial-use requester means requesters seeking information for a  use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests  of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In  determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the  CSB shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a  requester will put the documents requested. Where the CSB has reasonable  cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought,  or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the CSB shall  seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific  category.</p><p class="depth0">Confidential business information means records provided to the  government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from  disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could  reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth0">Direct costs means those expenditures by the CSB actually incurred  in searching for and duplicating records to respond to a FOIA request.  Direct costs include the salary of the employee or employees performing  the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus a percentage of  that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating  machinery. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the  cost of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the  records are stored.</p><p class="depth0">Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document  necessary to fulfill a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of,  among other things, paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or  machine-readable documentation. The copies provided shall be in a form  that is reasonably usable by requesters.</p><p class="depth0">Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private  elementary or high school, an institution of undergraduate higher  education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution  of professional education, and an institution of vocational education,  which operates a program of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth0">FOIA Officer means the person designated to process requests for CSB  documents under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth0">Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution that  is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is used above in  defining commercial-use requester, and which is operated solely for the  purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not  intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth0">Record includes any writing, drawing, map, recording, tape, film,  photo, or other documentary material by which information is preserved.</p><p class="depth0">Representative of the news media refers to any person actively  gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish  or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is  about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.  For freelance journalists to be regarded as working for a news  organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting  publication through that organization. A publication contract would be  the clearest proof, but components shall also look to the past  publication record of a requester in making this determination.</p><p class="depth0">Requester means any person, including an individual, Indian tribe,  partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization  other than a Federal agency, that requests access to records in the  possession of the CSB.</p><p class="depth0">Review refers to the process of examining a record, in response to a  FOIA   request, to determine whether any portion of that record may be withheld  under one or more of the FOIA exemptions. It also includes the  processing of any record for disclosure; for example, redacting  information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Review does  not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues  regarding the use of FOIA exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Search refers to the time spent looking for material that is  responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within a document. The CSB shall ensure that  searches are conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner  reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth0">Submitter means any person or entity who provides information  directly or indirectly to the CSB. The term includes, but is not limited  to, corporations, Indian tribal governments, state governments, and  foreign governments.</p><p class="depth0">Working day means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays,  Sundays, or Federal holidays.</p>
