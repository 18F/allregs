                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right of reconsideration. Every individual who has filed a  petition and has been denied payment may seek reconsideration. To seek  such reconsideration, the petitioner must put a request for  reconsideration in writing and send it to the Deputy Associate  Administrator for Health Professions, Health Resources and Services  Administration, Room 8A-54, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland  20857. The request for reconsideration must be received by the Deputy  Associate Administrator for Health Professions within   60 calendar days of the date the Department denied the petition for  payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for reconsideration. The request for reconsideration  must state the reasons why the petitioner is seeking reconsideration.  However, the request for reconsideration may not include any additional  documentation that was not included in the completed petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review process. When the Deputy Associate Administrator for  Health Professions receives a request for reconsideration, he will  convene a panel of three individuals, who are independent of the Ricky  Ray Program Office, to review the initial determination and make a  recommendation regarding payment. The Deputy Associate Administrator for  Health Professions will review the panel's recommendation and then  determine whether the petitioner is eligible for payment under the Act.  The Deputy Associate Administrator for Health Professions' determination  will constitute the Department's final action on the request for  reconsideration. If the determination is that the petitioner is eligible  for payment, the petitioner will receive payment as described in Sec.   130.3. If the determination is that the petitioner is not eligible for  payment, the Deputy Associate Administrator for Health Professions will  inform the petitioner in writing of the reasons for this determination.</p>
