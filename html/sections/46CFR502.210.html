                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Motion for order to compel initial disclosures or compliance  with discovery requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party may file a motion pursuant to Sec.  502.69 for an order compelling compliance with the requirement for  initial disclosures provided in Sec. 502.201 or with its discovery  requests as provided in this subpart, if a deponent fails to answer a  question asked at a deposition or by written questions; a corporation or  other entity fails to make a designation of an individual who will  testify on its behalf; a party fails to answer an interrogatory; or a  party fails to respond that inspection will be permitted, or fails to  permit inspection, as requested under Sec. 502.206 of this subpart. For  purposes of this section, a failure to make a disclosure, answer, or  respond includes an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or  response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A motion to compel must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A certification that the moving party has conferred in good  faith or attempted to confer with the party failing to make initial  disclosure or respond to discovery requests as provided in this subpart  in an effort to obtain compliance without the necessity of a motion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the discovery requests that have not been answered or  for which evasive or incomplete responses have been given. If the motion  is limited to specific discovery requests, only those requests are to be  included;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a disclosure has been made or an answer or response has  been given, a copy of the disclosure, answer, or response in its  entirety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of the certificate of service that accompanied the  discovery request; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A request for relief and supporting argument, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A party may file a response to the motion within 7 days of the  service date of the motion. Unless there is a dispute with respect to  the accuracy of the versions of the discovery requests, responses  thereto, or the disclosures submitted by the moving party, the response  must not include duplicative copies of them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A reply to a response is not allowed unless requested by the  presiding officer, or upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to comply with order compelling disclosures or  discovery. If a party or a party's officer or authorized representative  fails or refuses to obey an order requiring it to make disclosures or to  respond to discovery requests, the presiding officer upon his or her own  initiative or upon motion of a party may make such orders in regard to  the failure or refusal as are just. A motion must include a  certification that the moving party has conferred in good faith or  attempted to confer with the disobedient party in an effort to obtain  compliance without the necessity of a motion. An order of the presiding  officer may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct that the matters included in the order or any other  designated facts must be taken to be established for the purposes of the  action as the party making the motion claims;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibit the disobedient party from supporting or opposing  designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in  evidence; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Strike pleadings in whole or in part; staying further  proceedings until the order is obeyed; or dismissing the action or  proceeding or any party thereto, or rendering a decision by default  against the disobedient party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement of orders and subpoenas. In the event of refusal to  obey an order or failure to comply with a subpoena, the Attorney General  at the request of the Commission, or any party injured thereby may seek  enforcement by a United States district court having jurisdiction over  the parties. Any action with respect to enforcement of subpoenas or  orders relating to depositions, written interrogatories, or other  discovery matters must be taken within 20 days of the date of refusal to  obey or failure to comply. A private party must advise the Commission 5  days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) before applying  to the court of its intent to seek enforcement of such subpoenas and  discovery orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Persons and documents located in a foreign country. Orders of  the presiding officer directed to persons or documents located in a  foreign country must become final orders of the Commission unless an  appeal to the Commission is filed within 10 days after date of issuance  of such orders or unless the Commission on its own motion reverses,  modifies, or stays such rulings within 20 days of their issuance.  Replies to appeals may be filed within 10 days. No motion for leave to  appeal is necessary in such instances and no orders of the presiding  officer must be effective until 20 days from date of issuance unless the  Commission otherwise directs.
