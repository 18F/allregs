                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart implements and explains the provisions of the loan documents setting forth the requirements and procedures to be followed by borrowers when outside plant major construction by contract is financed by loan funds. Terms used in this subpart are defined in Sec. 1753.2 and RUS Contract Form 515.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contract method for major construction is described in Sec. 1753.5(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The two contract forms which may be used for major outside plant construction are Form 515 and Form 773. Limitations on the applicability of these forms shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form 515 shall be used for major outside plant construction projects which will be competitively bid. The contract contains plans and specifications and has no dollar limitation. See Sec. Sec. 1753.47, 1753.48 and 1753.49.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contract Form 515, which is for $250,000 or less, may, at the borrower's option, be negotiated. See Sec. 1753.48(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> RUS Form 773 may be used for minor outside plant projects which are not competitively bid because they cannot be designed and staked at the time of contract execution. Projects of this nature include routine line extensions and placement of subscriber drops. See subpart I of this part.
