                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identification test. Add a few drops of concentrated nitric acid  to about 10 mg of brucine alkaloid. A vivid red color is produced.  Dilute the red solution with a few drops of water and add a few drops of  freshly made dilute stannous chloride solution. A reddish purple  (violet) color is produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Melting point. 178 [deg]1 [deg]C. Dry the  alkaloid in an oven for one hour at 100 [deg]C., increase the  temperature to 110[deg] and dry to a constant weight before taking  melting point.</p><p class="depth0">Note. Brucine alkaloid tetrahydrate melts at 105 [deg]C. while the  anhydrous form melts at 178 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Strychnine test. Brucine alkaloid shall be free of strychnine  when tested by the method listed under Brucine Sulfate, N.F. IX.</p><p class="depth0">Note. If the brucine contains as much as 0.05 percent strychnine, a  clear distinctive violet color, characteristic of strychnine, will be  obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sulfate test. No white precipitate is formed that is not  dissolved by hydrochloric acid when several drops of a 1 N barium  chloride solution are added to 10 ml of a solution of the alkaloid.  [T.D. ATF-133, 48 FR 24673, June 2, 1983. Redesignated by T.D.

Colorless.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dryness at 20 [deg]C. Miscible without turbidity with 10 volumes  of 60[deg] B[eacute]1. gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Odor. Characteristic odor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Specific gravity at 20 [deg]/20 [deg]C. 0.810 to 0.815.  [T.D. ATF-133, 48 FR 24673, June 2, 1983. Redesignated by T.D.

Colorless.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distillation range. When 100 ml of tertiary butyl alcohol are  distilled, none should distill below 78 [deg]C. and none above 85  [deg]C. More than 95 percent should distill between 81 [deg]-83 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dryness at 20 [deg]C. Miscible without turbidity with 19 volumes  of 60[deg] B[eacute]1. gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Freezing point (first needle). Above 20 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Identification test. Place five drops of a solution containing  approximately 0.1 percent tertiary butyl alcohol in ethyl alcohol in a  test tube. Add 2 ml of Denige's reagent (dissolve 5 grams of red  mercuric oxide in 20 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid; add this solution  to 80 ml of distilled water, and filter when cool). Heat the mixture  just to the boiling point and remove from the flame. A yellow  precipitate forms within a few seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Nonvolatile matter. Less than 0.005 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Odor. Characteristic odor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Residual odor after evaporation.
