                            <p class="depth0">Funding a conference through an HHS contract does not automatically imply HHS (OPDIV/STAFFDIV) conference sponsorship, unless the conference is funded entirely by HHS.

Also, HHS staff attendance or participation at a conference does not imply HHS conference sponsorship. Accordingly, for other than conference contracts funded entirely by HHS, prior to a contractor claiming HHS conference sponsorship, the contractor must provide to the Contracting Officer a written request for permission to claim HHS as the conference sponsor--see 370.602. The OPDIV/STAFFDIV head, or designee, shall approve such requests.</p>
