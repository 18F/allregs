This includes the legal authority of local agencies and State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a plan or portion thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the State because of inadequate legal authority, substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
