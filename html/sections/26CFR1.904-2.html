                                Sec. 1.904-2  Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Credit for foreign tax carryback or carryover. A taxpayer who chooses to claim a credit under section 901 for a taxable year is allowed a credit under that section not only for taxes otherwise allowable as a credit but also for taxes deemed paid or accrued in that year as a result of a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c). However, the taxes so deemed paid or accrued shall not be allowed as a deduction under section 164(a). Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and Sec. 1.904-3, providing rules for the computation of carryovers and carrybacks, do not reflect a number of intervening statutory amendments, including the redesignation of section 904(d) as section 904(c) for taxable years beginning after 1975, amendments to sections 904(d) and (f) regarding the application of separate limitations in taxable years beginning after 1986, the limitation of the carryback period to one year for unused foreign taxes arising in taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, and the extension of the carryover period to ten years for unused foreign taxes that may be carried to any taxable year ending after October 22, 2004. However, the principles of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and Sec. 1.904-3(b) through (g) shall apply in determining carrybacks and carryovers of unused foreign taxes, modified so as to take into account the effect of statutory amendments. For transition rules relating to the carryover and carryback of unused foreign tax paid with respect to dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations, see paragraph (h) of this section. For special rules regarding these computations in case of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income or foreign oil related income, see section 907(f) and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Years to which carried--(1) General. If the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901 for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, any unused foreign tax (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) for such year shall, under section 904(d), be carried to the second preceding taxable year, the first

preceding taxable year, and the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth succeeding taxable years, in that order and to the extent not absorbed as taxes deemed paid or accrued, under paragraph (c) of this section, in a prior taxable year. The entire unused foreign tax for any taxable year shall first be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which, under the preceding sentence, such unused foreign tax may be carried. Any portion of such unused foreign tax not deemed paid or accrued under paragraph (c) of this section in such earliest taxable year shall then be carried to the next earliest taxable year to which such unused foreign tax may be carried, and any portion not absorbed in that year shall then be carried to the next earliest year, and so on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

The unused foreign tax for 1961 and 1962 are not taken into account, since neither of those years is a year earlier than 1960, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation is being determined. Thus, for example, the excess limitation for 1963 is $200, unreduced by the unused foreign tax for 1961 and 1962. There is no excess limitation for 1966 with respect to the unused foreign tax for 1960, since the unused foreign tax may be carried forward only 5 taxable years. The unused foreign tax ($730) for 1960 is thus absorbed as taxes deemed paid to the extent of the excess limitation for each of the taxable years 1958, 1959, 1963, 1964, and 1965, respectively, and in that order,

leaving unused foreign tax in the amount of $80 which cannot be absorbed because it cannot be carried beyond 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of unused foreign tax for 1961 which is deemed paid in 1966 is $70, the smaller of (a) that portion of the unused foreign tax carried to 1966 ($70), or (b) the excess limitation for 1966 with respect to such unused foreign tax ($200). The unused foreign tax for 1962 ($50) is not taken into account for such purposes, since that year is not a year earlier than 1961, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation for 1966 is being determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The excess limitation for 1966 with respect to the unused foreign tax for 1962 is $130, the amount by which the limitation applicable under section 904(a)(1) for 1966 ($600) exceeds the sum of the taxes actually paid ($400) to country X in that year and the unused foreign tax ($70) for 1961 which is absorbed in 1966 as taxes deemed paid and which is carried from a taxable year earlier than 1962, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation is being determined. The unabsorbed part ($80) of the unused foreign tax for 1960, a year earlier than 1962, is not taken into account in computing the excess limitation for 1966, since the unused foreign tax for 1960 may not be carried beyond 1965. The unused foreign tax ($50) for 1962 is thus absorbed in full in 1966 as taxes deemed paid, since the unused foreign tax does not exceed the excess limitation ($130) for that year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as those in example 1 except that the taxpayer does not choose to have the benefits of section 901 for 1961. In that case there is no unused foreign tax for that year to carry back or over to be absorbed in other taxable years as taxes deemed paid. Moreover, the excess limitation for 1966 which is available to absorb the unused foreign tax for 1962 is $200, instead of $130, that is, the amount by which the limitation applicable under section 904(a)(1) for 1966 ($600) exceeds the taxes actually paid ($400) to country X in that year. The amount of the unused foreign tax absorbed in each taxable year as taxes deemed paid is the same as in example 1 except for 1966. In that year only the unused foreign tax ($50) for 1962 is absorbed as taxes deemed paid.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as those in example 1 except that the taxpayer does not choose the benefits of section 901 for 1959. Since the excess limitation for a taxable year for which the taxpayer does not claim a credit under section 901 is determined in the same manner as though the taxpayer had chosen such credit, the excess limitation for 1959 is determined to be $90 just as in example 1. Moreover, even though such excess limitation absorbs a carryback of $90 from the unused tax for 1960, none of such $90 so deemed paid in 1959 is allowed as a deduction under section 164 or as a credit under section 901 for 1959 or for any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B, a calendar year taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements methods of accounting, chooses the benefits of section 901 for each of the taxable years 1957, 1958, and 1959.

However, the excess limitation for 1963 ($420) computed on the basis of the overall limitation is available to absorb the unused foreign tax for 1962 ($100), the unused foreign tax for 1964 ($125), and the unused foreign tax for 1965 ($50), leaving an excess limitation above such absorption of $145 ($420-$275).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Transition rules for carryovers and carrybacks of pre-2003 and post-2002 unused foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations--(1) Carryover of unused foreign tax.

Sec. 1.904-7(f)(9)(iv) and 1.904(f)-12(g)(3), the rules of this paragraph (h)(1) apply to reallocate to the taxpayer's other separate categories any unused foreign taxes (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) that were paid or accrued or deemed paid under section 902 with respect to a dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation paid in a taxable year of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2003, which taxes were subject to a separate limitation for dividends from that noncontrolled section 902 corporation. To the extent any such unused foreign taxes are carried forward to a taxable year of a domestic shareholder beginning on or after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, such taxes shall be allocated among the taxpayer's separate categories in the same proportions as the related dividend would have been assigned had such dividend been eligible for look-through treatment when paid.

The unused foreign taxes that are carried forward shall be treated as allocable to general limitation income to the extent that such taxes would otherwise have been allocable to passive income, either on a look-through basis or as a result of inadequate substantiation under the rules of Sec. 1.904-7(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carryover of unused foreign tax.
