Thereafter, an allegation of use may be submitted only as a statement of use under Sec.  2.88 after the issuance of a notice of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act. An amendment to allege use filed outside the time period specified in this paragraph will not be reviewed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For a trademark, service mark, collective trademark, collective service mark, and certification mark, an amendment to allege use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce on or in connection with all the goods or services specified in the application for which the applicant will seek registration. For a collective membership mark, an amendment to allege use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce to indicate membership in the collective organization specified in the application for which the applicant will seek registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a trademark, service mark, collective trademark, collective service mark, and certification mark, an amendment to allege use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce on or in connection with all the goods or services specified in the application for which the applicant will seek registration. For a collective membership mark, an amendment to allege use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce to indicate membership in the collective organization specified in the application for which the applicant will seek registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amendment to allege use may be accompanied by a request in accordance with Sec.  2.87 to divide out from the application the goods, services, or classes not yet in use in commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A complete amendment to allege use. A complete amendment to allege use must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A verified statement alleging:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant believes the applicant is the owner of the mark;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mark is in use in commerce;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date of first use of the mark anywhere on or in connection with the goods or services, and/or to indicate membership in the collective organization specified in the application, and the date of first use of the mark in commerce.

The Office will review a timely filed amendment to allege use to determine whether it meets the following minimum requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fee required by Sec.  2.6 for at least one class;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One specimen of the mark as used in commerce; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The verified statement in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Deficiency notification. If the amendment to allege use is filed within the permitted time period but does not meet the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Office will notify the applicant of the deficiency. The deficiency may be corrected provided the mark has not been approved for publication. If an acceptable amendment to correct the deficiency is not filed prior to approval of the mark for publication, the amendment will not be examined, and the applicant must instead file a statement of use after the notice of allowance issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notification of refusals and requirements. A timely filed amendment to allege use that meets the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section will be examined in accordance with Sec. Sec.  2.61 through 2.69.

The notification shall restate or incorporate by reference all unresolved refusals or requirements previously stated. The amendment to allege use may be amended in accordance with Sec.
