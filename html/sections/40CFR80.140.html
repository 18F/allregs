                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in this section apply only to subpart G of this part. Any terms not defined in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in 40 CFR part 80, subpart A, or, if not defined in 40 CFR part 80, subpart A, shall have the meaning given them in 40 CFR part 79, subpart A.</p><p class="depth0">Additization means the addition of detergent to gasoline or post-refinery component in order to create detergent-additized gasoline or detergent-additized post-refinery component.</p><p class="depth0">Automated detergent blending facility means any facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) at which detergent is blended with gasoline or post-refinery component, by means of an injector system calibrated to automatically deliver a prescribed amount of detergent.</p><p class="depth0">Base gasoline means any gasoline that does not contain detergent.</p><p class="depth0">Carburetor deposits means the deposits formed in the carburetor during operation of a carburetted gasoline engine which can disrupt the ability of the carburetor to maintain the proper air/fuel ratio.</p><p class="depth0">Carrier of detergent means any distributor of detergent who transports or stores or causes the transportation or storage of detergent without taking title to or otherwise having any ownership of the detergent, and without altering either the quality or quantity of the detergent.</p><p class="depth0">Deposit control effectiveness means the ability of a detergent additive package to prevent the formation of deposits in gasoline engines.</p><p class="depth0">Deposit control efficiency means the degree to which a detergent additive package at a given concentration in gasoline is effective in limiting the formation of deposits. The addition of inactive ingredients to a detergent additive package, to the extent that this addition dilutes the concentration of the detergent-active components, reduces the deposit control efficiency of the package.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent additive package means any chemical compound or combination of chemical compounds, including carrier oils, that may be added to gasoline, or to post-refinery component blended with gasoline, in order to control deposit formation. Carrier oil means an oil that may be added to the package to mediate or otherwise enhance the detergent chemical's ability to control deposits. A detergent additive package may contain non-detergent-active components such as corrosion inhibitors, antioxidants, metal deactivators, and handling solvents.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent blender means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises the blending operation of a detergent blending facility, or imports detergent-additized gasoline or detergent-additized post-refinery component.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent blending facility means any facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) at which detergent is blended with gasoline or post-refinery component.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent-active components means the components of a detergent additive package which act to prevent the formation of deposits, including, but not necessarily limited to, the actual detergent chemical and any carrier oil (if present) that acts to enhance the detergent's ability to control deposits.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent-additized gasoline (also called detergent gasoline) means any gasoline that contains base gasoline and detergent.</p><p class="depth0">Detergent-additized post-refinery component means any post-refinery component that contains detergent.</p><p class="depth0">Distributor of detergent means any person who transports or stores or causes the transportation or storage of detergent at any point between its manufacture and its introduction into gasoline.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel injector deposits (also known as port fuel injector deposits or PFID) means the deposits formed on fuel injector(s) during and after operation of a gasoline engine, as evaluated by the reduction in the gasoline flow rate through the fuel injector(s).</p><p class="depth0">Gasoline means any fuel for use in motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, including both highway and off-highway vehicles and engines, and commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline. The term ``gasoline'' is inclusive of base gasoline, detergent gasoline, and base gasoline or detergent gasoline that has been commingled with post-refinery component.</p><p class="depth0">Hand blending detergent facility means any facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) at which detergent is blended with gasoline or post-refinery component by the manual addition of detergent, or at which detergent is blended with these substances by any means that is not automated.</p><p class="depth0">Intake valve deposits (IVD) means the deposits formed on the intake valve(s) during operation of a gasoline engine, as evaluated by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Leaded gasoline means gasoline which is produced with the use of any lead additive or which contains more than 0.05 gram of lead per gallon or more than 0.005 gram of phosphorus per gallon.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer of detergent means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a facility that manufactures detergent. Pursuant to the definition in 40 CFR 79.2(f), a manufacturer of detergent is also considered an additive manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">Post-refinery component means any gasoline blending stock or any oxygenate which is blended with gasoline subsequent to the gasoline refining process.</p><p class="depth0">Repeatability of a test method means the amount of random error which is expected to affect the results obtained for a given test substance, when the test is replicated by a single operator in a given laboratory within a short period of time, using the same apparatus under constant operating conditions. Quantitatively, it is the difference between two such single results that would be exceeded in the long run in only one out of twenty normal and correct replications of the test method.
