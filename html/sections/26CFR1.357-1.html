                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> provides, subject to the exceptions and  limitations specified in section 357 (b) and (c), that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Liabilities assumed are not to be treated as ``other property or  money'' for the purpose of determining the amount of realized gain which  is to be recognized under section 351, 361, 371, or 374, if the  transactions would, but for the receipt of ``other property or money''  have been exchanges of the type described in any one of such sections;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the only type of consideration received by the transferor in  addition to that permitted to be received by section 351, 361, 371, or  374, consists of an assumption of liabilities, the transaction, if  otherwise qualified, will be deemed to be within the provisions of  section 351, 361, 371, or 374.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of general rule. The application of paragraph (a) of  this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A, an individual, transfers to a controlled corporation  property with an adjusted basis of $10,000 in exchange for stock of the  corporation with a fair market value of $8,000, $3,000 cash, and the  assumption by the corporation of indebtedness of A amounting to $4,000.  A's gain is $5,000, computed as follows:  Stock received, fair market value.............................    $8,000 Cash received.................................................     3,000 Liability assumed by transferee...............................     4,000</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Total consideration received.................................    15,000 Less: Adjusted basis of property transferred..................    10,000</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Gain realized................................................     5,000</p><p class="depth2">Assuming that the exchange falls within section 351 as a transaction in  which the gain to be recognized is limited to ``other property or  money'' received, the gain recognized to A will be limited to the $3,000  cash received, since, under the general rule of section 357(a), the  assumption of the $4,000 liability does not constitute ``other  property.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tax avoidance purpose. The benefits of section 357(a) do not  extend to any exchange involving an assumption of liabilities where it  appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to such  assumption was to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or, if not  such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose. In such cases, the  total amount of liabilities assumed or acquired pursuant to such  exchange (and not merely a particular liability with respect to which  the tax avoidance purpose existed) shall, for the purpose of determining  the amount of gain to be recognized upon the exchange in which the  liabilities are assumed or acquired, be treated as money received by the  taxpayer upon the exchange. Thus, if in the example set forth in  paragraph (b) of this section, the principal purpose of the assumption  of the $4,000 liability was to avoid tax on the exchange, or was not a  bona fide business purpose, then the amount   of gain recognized would be $5,000. In any suit or proceeding where the  burden is on the taxpayer to prove that an assumption of liabilities is  not to be treated as ``other property or money'' under section 357,  which is the case if the Commissioner determines that the taxpayer's  purpose with respect thereto was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax  on the exchange or was not a bona fide business purpose, and the  taxpayer contests such determination by litigation, the taxpayer must  sustain such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence. Thus,  the taxpayer must prove his case by such a clear preponderance of all  the evidence that the absence of a purpose to avoid Federal income tax  on the exchange, or the presence of a bona fide business purpose, is  unmistakable.
