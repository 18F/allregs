                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Airspeed limitations. The following airspeed limitations and any  other airspeed limitations necessary for safe operation must be  furnished:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum operating limit speed VMO/MMO and a statement that  this speed limit may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of  flight (climb, cruise, or descent) unless a higher speed is authorized  for flight test or pilot training.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an airspeed limitation is based upon compressibility effects,  a statement to this effect and information as to any symptoms, the  probable behavior of the airplane, and the recommended recovery  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The maneuvering speed established under Sec. 25.1507 and  statements, as applicable to the particular design, explaining that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full application of pitch, roll, or yaw controls should be  confined to speeds below the maneuvering speed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rapid and large alternating control inputs, especially in  combination with large changes in pitch, roll, or yaw, and full control  inputs in more than one axis at the same time, should be avoided as they  may result in structural failures at any speed, including below the  maneuvering speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The flap extended speed VFE and the pertinent flap positions and  engine powers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The landing gear operating speed or speeds, and a statement  explaining the speeds as defined in Sec. 25.1515(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The landing gear extended speed VLE, if greater than VLO, and a  statement that this is the maximum speed at which the airplane can be  safely flown with the landing gear extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Powerplant limitations. The following information must be  furnished:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitations required by Sec. 25.1521 and Sec. 25.1522.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Explanation of the limitations, when appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information necessary for marking the instruments required by  Sec.

The weight and center of  gravity limitations established under Sec. 25.1519 must be furnished in  the Airplane Flight Manual. All of the following information, including  the weight distribution limitations established under Sec. 25.1519,  must be presented either in the Airplane Flight Manual or in a separate  weight and balance control and loading document that is incorporated by  reference in the Airplane Flight Manual:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The condition of the airplane and the items included in the  empty weight as defined in accordance with Sec. 25.29.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loading instructions necessary to ensure loading of the airplane  within the weight and center of gravity limits, and to maintain the  loading within these limits in flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If certification for more than one center of gravity range is  requested, the appropriate limitations, with regard to weight and  loading procedures, for each separate center of gravity range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Flight crew. The number and functions of the minimum flight crew  determined under Sec. 25.1523 must be furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Kinds of operation. The kinds of operation approved under Sec.  25.1525 must be furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ambient air temperatures and operating altitudes.
