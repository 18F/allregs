                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A miner who is determined to be eligible for benefits under this  part or part 727 of this subchapter (see Sec. 725.4(d)) is entitled to  medical benefits as set forth in this subpart as of the date of his or  her claim, but in no event before January 1, 1974. No medical benefits  shall be provided to the survivor or dependent of a miner under this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A responsible operator, other employer, or where there is  neither, the fund, shall furnish a miner entitled to   benefits under this part with such medical, surgical, and other  attendance and treatment, nursing and hospital services, medicine and  apparatus, and any other medical service or supply, for such periods as  the nature of the miner's pneumoconiosis and disability requires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The medical benefits referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section shall include palliative measures useful only to prevent  pain or discomfort associated with the miner's pneumoconiosis or  attendant disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The costs recoverable under this subpart shall include the  reasonable cost of travel necessary for medical treatment (to be  determined in accordance with prevailing United States government  mileage rates) and the reasonable documented cost to the miner or  medical provider incurred in communicating with the employer, carrier,  or district director on matters connected with medical benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a miner receives a medical service or supply, as described in  this section, for any pulmonary disorder, there shall be a rebuttable  presumption that the disorder is caused or aggravated by the miner's  pneumoconiosis. The party liable for the payment of benefits may rebut  the presumption by producing credible evidence that the medical service  or supply provided was for a pulmonary disorder apart from those  previously associated with the miner's disability, or was beyond that  necessary to effectively treat a covered disorder, or was not for a  pulmonary disorder at all.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Evidence that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis or is not  totally disabled by pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment  is insufficient to defeat a request for coverage of any medical service  or supply under this subpart. In determining whether the treatment is  compensable, the opinion of the miner's treating physician may be  entitled to controlling weight pursuant to Sec. 718.104(d). A finding  that a medical service or supply is not covered under this subpart shall  not otherwise affect the miner's entitlement to benefits.</p>
