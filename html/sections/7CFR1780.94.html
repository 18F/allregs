                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section are minimum specifications only and  must be followed to the extent legally permissible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Type and denominations. Bond resolutions or ordinances will  provide that the instruments be either a bond representing the total  amount of the indebtedness or serial bonds in denominations customarily  accepted in municipal financing (ordinarily in multiples of not less  than $1,000). Single bonds may provide for repayment of principal plus  interest or amortized installments. Amortized installments are preferred  by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bond registration. Bonds will contain provisions permitting  registration for both principal and interest. Bonds purchased by the  Agency will be registered in the name of ``United States of America''  and will remain so registered at all times while the bonds are held or  insured by the Government. The Agency address for registration purposes  will be that of the Finance Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Size and quality. Size of bonds and coupons should conform to  standard practice. Paper must be of sufficient quality to prevent  deterioration through ordinary handling over the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of bond. Bonds will normally be dated as of the day of  delivery. However, the borrower may use another date if approved by the  Agency. Loan closing is the date of delivery of the bonds or the date of  delivery of the first bond when utilizing serial bonds, regardless of  the date of delivery of the funds. The date of delivery will be stated  in the bond if different from the date of the bond. In all cases,  interest will accrue from the date of delivery of the funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment date. Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with  income availability and be in accordance with State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If income is available monthly, monthly payments are recommended  unless precluded by State law. If income is available quarterly or  otherwise more frequently than annually, payments must be scheduled on  such basis. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest  (P&I;) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The payment schedule will be enumerated in the evidence of debt,  or if that is not feasible, in a supplemental agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If feasible, the first payment will be scheduled one full month,  or other period, as appropriate, from the date of loan closing or any  deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th, and 31st day of  the month will be avoided. When principal payments are deferred,  interest-only payments will be scheduled at least annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Extra payments. Extra payments are derived from the sale of  basic chattel or real estate security, refund of unused loan funds, cash  proceeds of   property insurance and similar actions which reduce the value of basic  security. At the option of the borrower, regular facility revenue may  also be used as extra payments when regular payments are current. Unless  otherwise established in the note or bond, extra payments will be  applied as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For loans with amortized debt instruments, extra payments will  be applied first to interest accrued to the date of receipt of the  payment and second to principal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For loans with debt instruments with P&I; installments, the extra  payment will be applied to the final unpaid principal installment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For borrowers with more than one loan, the extra payment will be  applied to the account secured by the lowest priority of lien on the  property from which the extra payments was obtained. Any balance will be  applied to other Agency loans secured by the property from which the  extra payment was obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For assessment bonds, see paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The place of payments on bonds purchased by the Agency will be  determined by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Redemptions. Bonds will normally contain customary redemption  provisions. However, no premium will be charged for early redemption on  any bonds held by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Additional revenue bonds. Parity bonds may be issued to complete  the project. Otherwise, parity bonds may not be issued unless acceptable  documentation is provided establishing that net revenues for the fiscal  year following the year in which such bonds are to be issued will be at  least 120 percent of the average annual debt serviced requirements on  all bonds outstanding, including the newly-issued bonds. For purposes of  this section, net revenues are, unless otherwise defined by State  statute, gross revenues less essential operation and maintenance  expenses. This limitation may be waived or modified by the written  consent of bondholders representing 75 percent of the then-outstanding  principal indebtedness. Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued in  accordance with the loan resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Precautions. The following types of provisions in debt  instruments should be avoided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provisions for the holder to manually post each payment to the  instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions for returning the permanent or temporary debt  instrument to the borrower in order that it, rather than the Agency, may  post the date and amount of each advance or repayment on the instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provisions that amend covenants contained in RUS Bulletins 1780- 27 or 1780-28.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond  issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the contractual  provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing requirement and  any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect precludes the Agency  from requiring refinancing before the final maturity date, it represents  a violation of the statutory refinancing requirement; therefore, it is  disallowed. No loan documents shall include a provision of defeasance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Assessment bonds. When security includes special assessment to  be collected over the life of the loan, the instrument should address  the method of applying any payments made before they are due. It may be  desirable for such payments to be distributed over remaining payments  due, rather than to be applied in accordance with normal procedures  governing extra payments, so that the account does not become  delinquent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Multiple debt instruments. The following will be adhered to when  preparing debt instruments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When more than one loan type is used in financing a project,  each type of loan will be evidenced by a separate debt instrument or  series of debt instruments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loans obligated in different fiscal years and those obligated  with different terms in the same fiscal year will be evidenced by  separate debt instruments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loans obligated for the same loan type in the same fiscal year  with the same term may be combined in the same debt instrument;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Loans obligated in the same fiscal year with different interest  rates that will be closed at the same interest rate may be combined in  the same debt instrument.
