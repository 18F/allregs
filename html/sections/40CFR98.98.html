                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in this section, all of the terms used in this  subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A  of this part. If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this  subpart and a definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this  subpart takes precedence for the reporting requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Abatement system means a device or equipment that is designed to  destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs or N2O in exhaust streams  from one or more electronics manufacturing production processes, or for  which the destruction or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or  N2O has been properly measured according to the procedures  under Sec. 98.94(f)(4), even if that abatement system is not designed  to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs or N2O. The device or  equipment is only an abatement system for the individual fluorinated  GHGs or N2O that it is designed to destroy or remove or for  the individual fluorinated GHGs or N2O for which destruction  or removal efficiencies were properly measured according to the  procedures under Sec. 98.94(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Actual gas consumption means the quantity of gas used during wafer/ substrate processing over some period based on a measured change in gas  container weight or gas container pressure or on a measured volume of  gas.</p><p class="depth0">By-product formation means the creation of fluorinated GHGs during  electronics manufacturing production processes or the creation of  fluorinated GHGs by an abatement system. Where the procedures in Sec.  98.93(a) are used to   calculate annual emissions, by-product formation is the ratio of the  mass of the by-product formed to the mass flow of the input gas. Where  the procedures in Sec. 98.93(i) are used to calculate annual emissions,  by-product formation is the ratio of the mass of the by-product formed  to the total mass flow of all fluorinated GHG input gases.</p><p class="depth0">Chamber cleaning is a process type that consists of the process sub- types defined in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In situ plasma process sub-type consists of the cleaning of  thin-film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a  fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent that is dissociated into its cleaning  constituents by a plasma generated inside the chamber where the film is  produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remote plasma process sub-type consists of the cleaning of thin- film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a  fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent dissociated by a remotely located  plasma source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In situ thermal process sub-type consists of the cleaning of  thin-film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a  fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent that is thermally dissociated into its  cleaning constituents inside the chamber where thin films are produced.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled emissions means the quantity of emissions that are  released to the atmosphere after application of an emission control  device (e.g., abatement system).</p><p class="depth0">Destruction or removal efficiency (DRE) means the efficiency of an  abatement system to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs, N2O,  or both. The destruction or removal efficiency is equal to one minus the  ratio of the mass of all relevant GHGs exiting the abatement system to  the mass of GHG entering the abatement system. When GHGs are formed in  an abatement system, destruction or removal efficiency is expressed as  one minus the ratio of amounts of exiting GHGs to the amounts entering  the system in units of CO2-equivalents (CO2e).</p><p class="depth0">Fab means the portion of an electronics manufacturing facility  located in a separate physical structure that began manufacturing on a  certain date.</p><p class="depth0">Fluorinated heat transfer fluids means fluorinated GHGs used for  temperature control, device testing, cleaning substrate surfaces and  other parts, and soldering in certain types of electronics manufacturing  production processes.

This includes being properly operated  within the range of parameters as specified in the site maintenance plan  for abatement systems.</p><p class="depth0">Plasma etching is a process type that consists of any production  process using fluorinated GHG reagents to selectively remove materials  from a substrate during electronics manufacturing. The materials removed  may include SiO2, SiOX-based or fully organic- based thin-film material, SiN, SiON, Si3N4, SiC,  SiCO, SiCN, etc. (represented by the general chemical formula,  SiwOXNyXz where w, x, y and  z are zero or integers and X may be some other element such as carbon),  substrate, or metal films (such as aluminum or tungsten).</p><p class="depth0">Process sub-type is a set of similar manufacturing steps, more  closely related within a broad process type. For example, the chamber  cleaning process type includes in-situ plasma chamber cleaning, remote  plasma chamber cleaning, and in-situ thermal chamber cleaning sub-types.</p><p class="depth0">Process types are broad groups of manufacturing steps used at a  facility associated with substrate (e.g., wafer) processing during  device manufacture for which fluorinated GHG emissions and fluorinated  GHG consumption is calculated and reported. The process types are Plasma  etching/Wafer Cleaning and Chamber cleaning.</p><p class="depth0">Properly measured destruction or removal efficiency means  destruction or removal efficiencies measured in accordance with EPA 430- R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7), and, if  applicable, Appendix A to this subpart, or by an alternative method  approved by the Administrator as specified in Sec. 98.94(k).</p><p class="depth0">The Random Sampling Abatement System Testing Program (RSASTP) means  the required frequency for measuring the destruction or removal  efficiencies of abatement systems in order to apply properly measured  destruction or removal efficiencies to report controlled emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Redundant abatement systems means a system that is specifically  designed, installed and operated for the purpose of destroying  fluorinated GHGs and N2O gases, or for which the destruction  or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or N2O has been  properly measured according to the procedures under Sec. 98.94(f)(4),  and that is used as a backup to the main fluorinated GHGs and  N2O abatement system during those times when the main system  is not functioning or operating in accordance with design and operating  specifications.</p><p class="depth0">Repeatable means that the variables used in the formulas for the  facility's   engineering model for gas apportioning factors are based on observable  and measurable quantities that govern gas consumption rather than  engineering judgment about those quantities or gas consumption.</p><p class="depth0">Representative operating levels means (for purposes of verification  of the apportionment model or for determining the appropriate conditions  for stack testing) operating the fab, in terms of substrate starts for  the period of testing or monitoring, at no less than 50 percent of  installed production capacity or no less than 70 percent of the average  production rate for the reporting year, where production rate for the  reporting year is represented in average monthly substrate starts. For  the purposes of stack testing, the period for determining the  representative operating level must be the period ending on the same  date on which testing is concluded.</p><p class="depth0">Stack system means one or more stacks that are connected by a common  header or manifold, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas  stream originating from one or more fab processes is, or has the  potential to be, released to the atmosphere. For purposes of this  subpart, stack systems do not include emergency vents or bypass stacks  through which emissions are not usually vented under typical operating  conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Trigger point for change out means the residual weight or pressure  of a gas container type that a facility uses as an indicator that  operators need to change out that gas container with a full container.  The trigger point is not the actual residual weight or pressure of the  gas remaining in the cylinder that has been replaced.</p><p class="depth0">Unabated emissions means a gas stream containing fluorinated GHG or  N2O that has exited the process, but which has not yet been  introduced into an abatement system to reduce the mass of fluorinated  GHG or N2O in the stream. If the emissions from the process  are not routed to an abatement system, or are routed to an abatement  device that is not in an operational mode, unabated emissions are those  fluorinated GHG or N2O released to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Uptime means the ratio of the total time during which the abatement  system is in an operational mode, to the total time during which  production process tool(s) connected to that abatement system are  normally in operation.</p><p class="depth0">Wafer cleaning is a process type that consists of any production  process using fluorinated GHG reagents to clean wafers at any step  during production.</p><p class="depth0">Wafer passes is a count of the number of times a wafer substrate is  processed in a specific process sub-type, or type.

Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 98--Alternative Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">Measuring Point-of-Use Abatement Device Destruction or Removal</p><p class="depth0">Efficiency</p><p class="depth0">If you are measuring destruction or removal efficiency of a point- of-use abatement device according to EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 98.7) as specified in Sec. 98.94(f)(4), you may  follow the alternative procedures specified in paragraphs (a) through  (c) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(15)</em> of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Detection limits. The mass spectrometer chosen for this  application must have the necessary sensitivity to detect the selected  effluent species at or below the maximum field detection limits  specified in Table 3 of section 2.2.7 of EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 98.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling location. The sample at the inlet of the point-of-use  abatement device must be taken downstream of the process tool and pump  package. The sample exhaust must be vented back into the corrosive house  ventilation system at a point downstream of the sample inlet location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sampling conditions. For etch processes, destruction or removal  efficiencies must be determined while etching a substrate (product,  dummy, or test). For chemical vapor deposition processes, destruction or  removal efficiencies must be determined during a chamber clean after  deposition (destruction or removal efficiencies must not be determined  in a clean chamber). All sampling must be performed non-intrusively  during wafer processing. Samples must be drawn through the mass  spectrometer source by an   external sample pump. Because of the volatility, vapor pressure,  stability and inertness of CF4, C2F6,  C3F8, CHF3, NF3, and  SF6, the sample lines do not need to be heated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mass spectrometer parameters. The specific mass spectrometer  operating conditions such as electron energy, secondary electron  multiplier voltage, emission current, and ion focusing voltage must be  selected according to the specifications provided by the mass  spectrometer manufacturer, the mass spectrometer system manual, basic  mass spectrometer textbook, or other such sources. The mass spectrometer  responses to each of the target analytes must all be calibrated under  the same mass spectrometer operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Flow rates. A sample flow rate of 0.5-1.5 standard liters per  minute (slm) must be drawn from the process tool exhaust stream under  study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sample frequency. The mass spectrometer sampling frequency for  etch processes must be in the range of 0.5 to 1 cycles per second, and  for chemical vapor deposition processes must be in the range of 0.25 to  0.5 cycles per second. As an alternative you may use the sampling  frequencies specified in section 2.2.4 of EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 98.7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Dynamic dilution calibration parameters. The quadrupole mass  spectrometer must be calibrated for both mass location and response to  analytes. A dynamic dilution calibration system may be used to perform  both types of mass spectrometer system calibrations using two mass flow  controllers. Use one mass flow controller to regulate the flow rate of  the standard component used to calibrate the system and the second mass  flow controller to regulate the amount of diluent gas used to mix with  the standard to generate the calibration curve for each compound of  interest. The mass flow controller must be calibrated using the single  component gas being used with them, for example, nitrogen  (N2) for the diluent. A mass flow controller used with  calibration mixtures must be calibrated with the calibration mixture  balance gas (for example, N2 or He) if the analyte components  are 2 percent or less of the volume of the sample. All calibration  mixtures must be National Institute of Standards and Technology  Traceable gases or equivalent. They must be calibrated over their range  of use and must be operated in their experimentally determined dynamic  linear range. If compressed gas standards cannot be brought into the  fab, metered gas flows of target compounds into the process chamber,  under no thermal or plasma conditions and with no wafer(s) present, and  with no process emissions from other tools contributing to the sample  location, must then be performed throughout the appropriate  concentration ranges to derive calibration curves for the subsequent  destruction or removal efficiency tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Mass location calibration. A mixture containing 1 percent He,  Ar, Kr, and Xe in a balance gas of nitrogen must be used to assure the  alignment of the quadrupole mass filter (see EPA Method 205 at 40 CFR  part 51, appendix M as reference). The mass spectrometer must be chosen  so that the mass range is sufficient to detect the predominant peaks of  the components under study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Quadrupole mass spectrometer response calibration. A calibration  curve must be generated for each compound of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Calibration frequency. The mass spectrometer must be calibrated  at the start of testing a given process. The calibration must be checked  at the end of testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Calibration range. The mass spectrometer must be calibrated  over the expected concentration range of analytes using a minimum of  five concentrations including a zero. The zero point is defined as  diluent containing no added analyte.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)(i)</em> through (v) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must perform a qualitative mass calibration by running a  standard (or by flowing chamber gases under non-process conditions)  containing stable components such as Ar, Kr, and Xe that provide  predominant signals at m/e values distributed throughout the mass range  to be used. You must adjust the quadrupole mass filter as needed to  align with the inert gas fragments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must quantitatively calibrate the quadrupole mass  spectrometer for each analyte of interest. The analyte concentrations  during calibration must include the expected concentrations in the  process effluent. The calibration must be performed under the same  operating conditions, such as inlet pressure, as when sampling process  exhaust. If the calibration inlet pressure differs from the sampling  inlet pressure then the relationship between inlet pressure and  quadrupole mass spectrometer signal response must be empirically  determined and applied to correct for any differences between  calibration and process emissions monitoring data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To determine the response time of the instrument to changes in  a process, a process gas such as C2F6 must be  turned on at the process tool for a fixed period of time (for example,  20 seconds), after which the gas is shut off. The sample flow rate  through the system must be adjusted so that the signal increases to a  constant concentration within a few seconds and decreases to background  levels also within a few seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You must sample the process effluent through the quadrupole  mass spectrometer and acquire data for the required amount of time to  track the process, as determined in paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this  appendix. You   must set the sample frequency to monitor the changes in the process as  specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this appendix. You must repeat this for  at least five substrates on the same process and calculate the average  and standard deviation of the analyte concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> You must repeat the quantitative calibration at the conclusion  of sampling to identify any drifts in quadrupole mass spectrometer  sensitivity. If drift is observed, you must use an internal standard to  correct for changes in sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Sample analysis. To determine the concentration of a specific  component in the sample, you must divide the ion intensity of the sample  response by the calibrated response factor for each component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Deconvolution of interfering peaks. The effects of interfering  peaks must be deconvoluted from the mass spectra for each target  analyte.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Calculations. Plot ion intensity versus analyte concentration  for a given compound obtained when calibrating the analytical system.  Determine the slope and intercept for each calibrated species to obtain  response factors with which to calculate concentrations in the sample.  For an acceptable calibration, the R\2\ value of the calibration curve  must be at least 0.98.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(8)</em> through (17) of  this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conformance with provisions associated with the Calibration  Transfer Standard. This procedure calls for the use of a calibration  transfer standard in a number of instances. The use of a calibration  transfer standard is necessary to validate optical pathlength and  detector response for spectrometers where cell temperature, cell  pressure, and cell optical pathlength are potentially variable. For  fixed pathlength spectrometers capable of controlling cell temperature  and pressure to within  10 percent of a desired  set point, the use of a calibration transfer standard, as described in  paragraphs (b)(2) to (17) this appendix is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Defining spectroscopic conditions. Define a set of spectroscopic  conditions under which the field studies and subsequent field  applications are to be carried out. These include the minimum  instrumental line-width, spectrometer wave number range, sample gas  temperature, sample gas pressure, absorption pathlength, maximum  sampling system volume (including the absorption cell), minimum sample  flow rate, and maximum allowable time between consecutive infrared  analyses of the effluent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Criteria for reference spectral libraries. On the basis of  previous emissions test results and/or process knowledge (including the  documentation of results of any initial and subsequent tests, and the  final reports required in Sec. 98.97(d)(4)(i)), estimate the maximum  concentrations of all of the analytes in the effluent and their minimum  concentrations of interest (those concentrations below which the  measurement of the compounds is of no importance to the analysis).  Values between the maximum expected concentration and the minimum  concentration of interest are referred to below as the ``expected  concentration range.'' A minimum of three reference spectra is  sufficient for a small expected concentration range (e.g., a difference  of 30 percent of the range between the low and high ends of the range),  but a minimum of four spectra are needed where the range is greater,  especially for concentration ranges that may differ by orders of  magnitude. If the measurement method is not linear then multiple linear  ranges may be necessary. If this approach is adopted, then linear range  must be demonstrated to pass the required quality control. When the set  of spectra is ordered according to absorbance, the absorbance levels of  adjacent reference spectra should not differ by more than a factor of  six. Reference spectra for each analyte should be available at  absorbance levels that bracket the analyte's expected concentration  range; minimally, the spectrum whose absorbance exceeds each analyte's  expected maximum concentration or is within 30 percent of it must be  available. The reference spectra must be collected at or near the same  temperature and pressure at which the sample is to be analyzed under.  The gas sample pressure and temperature must be continuously monitored  during field testing and you must correct for differences in temperature  and pressure between the sample and reference spectra. Differences  between the sample and reference spectra conditions must not exceed 50  percent for pressure and 40 [deg]C for temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> and (ii) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reference spectra at the same absorbance level (to within 10  percent) of independently prepared samples must be recorded. The  reference samples must be prepared from neat forms of the analyte or  from gas   standards of the highest quality commonly available from commercial  sources. Either barometric or volumetric methods may be used to dilute  the reference samples to the required concentrations, and the equipment  used must be independently calibrated to ensure suitable accuracy.  Dynamic and static reference sample preparation methods are acceptable,  but dynamic preparations must be used for reactive analytes. Any well  characterized absorption pathlength may be employed in recording  reference spectra, but the temperature and pressure of the reference  samples should match as closely as possible those of the proposed  spectroscopic conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a mercury cadmium telluride or other potentially non-linear  detector (i.e., a detector whose response vs. total infrared power is  not a linear function over the range of responses employed) is used for  recording the reference spectra, you must correct for the effects of  this type of response on the resulting concentration values. As needed,  spectra of a calibration transfer standard must be recorded with the  laboratory spectrometer system to verify the absorption pathlength and  other aspects of the system performance. All reference spectral data  must be recorded in interferometric form and stored digitally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sampling system preparation. Construct a sampling system  suitable for delivering the proposed sample flow rate from the effluent  source to the infrared absorption cell. For the compounds of interest,  the surfaces of the system exposed to the effluent stream may need to be  stainless steel or Teflon; because of the potential for generation of  inorganic automated gases, glass surfaces within the sampling system and  absorption cell may need to be Teflon-coated. The sampling system should  be able to deliver a volume of sample that results in a necessary  response time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Preliminary analytical routines. For the proposed absorption  pathlength to be used in actual emissions testing, you must prepare an  analysis method containing of all the effluent compounds at their  expected maximum concentrations plus the field calibration transfer  standard compound at 20 percent of its full concentration as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Documentation. The laboratory techniques used to generate  reference spectra and to convert sample spectral information to compound  concentrations must be documented. The required level of detail for the  documentation is that which allows an independent analyst to reproduce  the results from the documentation and the stored interferometric data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Spectroscopic system performance. The performance of the  proposed spectroscopic system, sampling system, and analytical method  must be rigorously examined during and after a field study. Several  iterations of the analysis method may need to be applied depending on  observed concentrations, absorbance intensities, and interferences.  During the field study, all the sampling and analytical procedures  envisioned for future field applications must be documented. Additional  procedures not required during routine field applications, notably  dynamic spiking studies of the analyte gases, may be performed during  the field study. These additional procedures need to be performed only  once if the results are acceptable and if the effluent sources in future  field applications prove suitably similar to those chosen for the field  study. If changes in the effluent sources in future applications are  noted and require substantial changes to the analytical equipment and/or  conditions, a separate field study must be performed for the new set of  effluent source conditions. All data recorded during the study must be  retained and documented, and all spectral information must be  permanently stored in interferometric form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> System installation. The spectroscopic and sampling sub-systems  must be assembled and installed according to the manufacturers'  recommendations. For the field study, the length of the sample lines  used must not be less than the maximum length envisioned for future  field applications. The system must be given sufficient time to  stabilize before testing begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pre-Test calibration. Record a suitable background spectrum  using pure nitrogen gas; alternatively, if the analytes of interest are  in a sample matrix consistent with ambient air, it is beneficial to use  an ambient air background to control interferences from water and carbon  dioxide. For variable pathlength Fourier Transform Infrared  Spectrometers, introduce a sample of the calibration transfer standard  gas directly into the absorption cell at the expected sample pressure  and record its absorbance spectrum (the ``initial field calibration  transfer standard spectrum''). Compare it to the laboratory calibration  transfer standard spectra to determine the effective absorption  pathlength. If possible, record spectra of field calibration gas  standards (single component standards of the analyte compounds) and  determine their concentrations using the reference spectra and  analytical routines developed in paragraphs (b)(2) through (7) of this  appendix; these spectra may be used instead of the reference spectra in  actual concentration and uncertainty calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Deriving the calibration transfer standard gas from tool  chamber gases. The calibration transfer standard gas may be derived by  flowing appropriate semiconductor tool chamber gases under non-process  conditions (no thermal or plasma conditions and with no wafer(s)  present) if compressed gas standards cannot be brought on-site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Reactivity and response time checks. While sampling ambient air  and continuously recording absorbance spectra, suddenly replace the  ambient air flow with calibration transfer standard gas introduced as  close as possible to the probe tip. Examine the subsequent spectra to  determine whether the flow rate and sample volume allow the system to  respond quickly enough to changes in the sampled gas. Should a corrosive  or reactive gas be of interest in the sample matrix it would be  beneficial to determine the reactivity in a similar fashion, if  practical. Examine the subsequent spectra to ensure that the  reactivities of the analytes with the exposed surfaces of the sampling  system do not limit the time response of the analytical system. If a  pressure correction routine is not automated, monitor the absorption  cell temperature and pressure; verify that the (absolute) pressure  remains within 2 percent of the pressure specified in the proposed  system conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Analyte spiking. Analyte spiking must be performed. While  sampling actual source effluent, introduce a known flow rate of  calibration transfer standard gas into the sample stream as close as  possible to the probe tip or between the probe and extraction line.  Measure and monitor the total sample flow rate, and adjust the spike  flow rate until it represents 10 percent to 20 percent of the total flow  rate. After waiting until at least four absorption cell volumes have  been sampled, record four spectra of the spiked effluent, terminate the  calibration transfer standard spike flow, pause until at least four cell  volumes are sampled, and then record four (unspiked) spectra. Repeat  this process until 12 spiked and 12 unspiked spectra have been obtained.  If a pressure correction routine is not automated, monitor the  absorption cell temperature and pressure; verify that the pressure  remains within 2 percent of the pressure specified in the proposed  system conditions. Calculate the expected calibration transfer standard  compound concentrations in the spectra and compare them to the values  observed in the spectrum. This procedure is best performed using a  spectroscopic tracer to calculate dilution (as opposed to measured flow  rates) of the injected calibration transfer standard (or analyte). The  spectroscopic tracer should be a component not in the gas matrix that is  easily detectable and maintains a linear absorbance over a large  concentration range. Repeat this spiking process with all effluent  compounds that are potentially reactive with either the sampling system  components or with other effluent compounds. The gas spike is delivered  by a mass flow controller, and the expected concentration of analyte of  interest (AOITheoretical) is calculated as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13NO13.028  Where:  AOITheoretical = Theoretical analyte of interest concentration (parts</p><p class="depth0">per million (ppm)). Tracersample = Tracer concentration (ppm) as seen by the Fourier</p><p class="depth0">Transform Infrared Spectrometer during spiking. Tracercylinder = The concentration (ppm) of tracer recorded during</p><p class="depth0">direct injection of the cylinder to the Fourier Transform</p><p class="depth0">Infrared Spectrometer cell. AOIcylinder = The supplier-certified concentration (ppm) of the analyte</p><p class="depth0">of interest gas standard. AOInative = The native AOI concentration (ppm) of the effluent during</p><p class="depth0">stable conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Post-test calibration. At the end of a sampling run and at the  end of the field study, record the spectrum of the calibration transfer  standard gas. The resulting ``final field calibration transfer standard  spectrum'' must be compared to the initial field calibration transfer  standard spectrum to verify suitable stability of the spectroscopic  system throughout the course of the field study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Amendment of analytical routines. The presence of unanticipated  interferant compounds and/or the observation of compounds at  concentrations outside their expected concentration ranges may  necessitate the repetition of portions of the procedures in paragraphs  (b)(2) through (14) of this appendix. Such amendments are allowable  before final analysis of the data, but must be represented in the  documentation required in paragraph (b)(16) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Documentation. The sampling and spiking techniques used to  generate the field study spectra and to convert sample spectral  information to concentrations must be documented at a level of detail  that allows an independent analyst to reproduce the results from the  documentation and the stored interferometric data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)(i)</em> through  (iii) of this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sampling lines employed should be as short as practically  possible and not longer than those used in the field study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analyte spiking and reactivity checks are required after the  installation of or major repair to the sampling system or major change  in sample matrix. In these cases, perform three spiked/unspiked samples  with calibration transfer standard or a surrogate analyte on a daily  basis if time permits and gas standards are easy to obtain and get on- site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sampling and other operational data must be recorded and  documented as during the field study, but only the interferometric data  needed to sufficiently reproduce actual test and spiking data must be  stored permanently. The format of this data does not need to be  interferograms but may be absorbance spectra or single beams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em>  through (3) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You may introduce the non-reactive, non-native gas used for  determining total volume flow and dilution across the point-of-use  abatement device at a location in the exhaust of the point-of-use  abatement device. For abatement systems operating in a mode where  specific F-GHG are not readily abated, you may introduce the non- reactive, non-native gas used for determining total volume flow and  dilution across the point-of-use abatement device prior to the point-of- use abatement system; in this case, the tracer must be more difficult to  destroy than the target compounds being measured based on the thermal  stability of the tracer and target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this appendix. The sampling location should be  traversed with the sampling probe measuring the non-reactive, non-native  gas concentrations to ensure homogeneity of the non-reactive gas and  point-of-use abatement device effluent (i.e., stratification test). To  test for stratification, measure the non-reactive, non-native gas  concentrations at three points on a line passing through the centroidal  area. Space the three points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the  measurement line. Sample for a minimum of twice the system response  time, determined according to paragraph (c)(3) of this appendix, at each  traverse point. Calculate the individual point and mean non-reactive,  non-native gas concentrations. If the non-reactive, non-native gas  concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration  for all traverse points by no more than 5.0  percent of the mean concentration, the gas stream is considered  unstratified and you may collect samples from a single point that most  closely matches the mean. If the 5.0 percent criterion is not met, but  the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean  concentration for all traverse points by no more than 10.0 percent of the mean, you may take samples from two  points and use the average of the two measurements. Space the two points  at 16.7, 50.0, or 83.3 percent of the measurement line. If the  concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration  for all traverse points by more than 10.0 percent  of the mean but less than 20.0 percent, take samples from three points  at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line and use the  average of the three measurements. If the gas stream is found to be  stratified because the 20.0 percent criterion for a 3-point test is not  met, locate and sample the non-reactive, non-native gas from traverse  points for the test in accordance with Sections 11.2 and 11.3 of EPA  Method 1 in 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-1. A minimum of 40 non-reactive  gas concentration measurements will be collected at three to five  different injected non-reactive gas flow rates for determination of  point-of-use abatement device effluent flow. The total volume flow of  the point-of-use abatement device exhaust will be calculated consistent  with the EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7)  Equations 1 through 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iii) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before sampling begins, introduce ambient air at the probe  upstream of all sample condition components in system calibration mode.  Record the time it takes for the measured concentration of a selected  compound (for example, carbon dioxide) to reach steady state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Introduce nitrogen in the system calibration mode and record  the time required for the concentration of the selected compound to  reach steady state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Observe the time required to achieve 95 percent of a stable  response for both nitrogen and ambient air. The longer interval is the  measurement system response time.  [78 FR 68234, Nov. 13, 2013]   Subpart J [Reserved]</p>
