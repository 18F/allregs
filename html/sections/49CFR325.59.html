                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with the rules in this subpart, a measurement shall be  made of the sound level generated by a stationary motor vehicle as  follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Park the motor vehicle on the test site as specified in Sec.  325.53 of this subpart. If the motor vehicle is a combination  (articulated) vehicle, park the combination so that the longitudinal  centerlines of the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle or vehicles are  in substantial alinement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Turn off all auxiliary equipment which is installed on the motor  vehicle and which is designed to operate under normal conditions only  when the vehicle is operating at a speed of 5 mph (8 kph) or less.  Examples of such equipment include cranes, asphalt spreaders, liquid or  slurry pumps, auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the motor vehicle's engine radiator fan drive is equipped  with a clutch or similar device that automatically either reduces the  rotational speed of the fan or completely disengages the fan from its  power source in response to reduced engine cooling loads, park the  vehicle before testing with its engine running at high idle or any other  speed the operator may choose, for sufficient time but not more than 10  minutes, to permit the engine radiator fan to automatically disengage  when the vehicle's noise emissions are measured under stationary test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> With the motor vehicle's transmission in neutral and its clutch  engaged, rapidly accelerate the vehicle's engine from idle to its  maximum governed speed with wide open throttle. Return the engine's  speed to idle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Observe the maximum reading on the sound level measurement  system during the time the procedures specified in paragraph (d) of this  section are followed. Record that reading, if the reading has not been  influenced by extraneous noise sources such as motor vehicles operating  on adjacent roadways.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of  this section until the first two maximum sound level readings that are  within 2 dB(A) of each other are recorded. Numerically average those two  maximum sound level readings. When appropriate, correct the average  figure in accordance with the rules in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The average figure, corrected as appropriate, contained in  accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, is the sound level  generated by the motor vehicle for the purpose of determining whether it  conforms to the Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR  202.21. (Table 1 in Sec. 325.7 lists the range of maximum permissible  sound level readings for various test conditions.)  [40 FR 42437, Sept. 12, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 10226, Mar. 10, 1976]</p>
