                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Plan requirements. In accordance with the policy of section  101(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of the Act and the purposes of section 160 of the Act, each  applicable State Implementation Plan and each applicable Tribal  Implementation Plan shall contain emission limitations and such other  measures as may be necessary to prevent significant deterioration of air  quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan revisions. If a State Implementation Plan revision would  result in increased air quality deterioration over any baseline  concentration, the plan revision shall include a demonstration that it  will not cause or contribute to a violation of the applicable  increment(s). If a plan revision proposing less restrictive requirements  was submitted after August 7, 1977 but on or before any applicable  baseline date and was pending action by the Administrator on that date,  no such demonstration is necessary with respect to the area for which a  baseline date would be established before final action is taken on the  plan revision. Instead, the assessment described in paragraph (a)(4) of  this section, shall review the expected impact to the applicable  increment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Required plan revision. If the State or the Administrator  determines that a plan is substantially inadequate to prevent  significant deterioration or that an applicable increment is being  violated, the plan shall be revised to correct the inadequacy or the  violation. The plan shall be revised within 60 days of such a finding by  a State or within 60 days following notification by the Administrator,  or by such later date as prescribed by the Administrator after  consultation with the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plan assessment. The State shall review the adequacy of a plan  on a periodic basis and within 60 days of such time as information  becomes available that an applicable increment is being violated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Public participation. Any State action taken under this  paragraph shall be subject to the opportunity for public hearing in  accordance with procedures equivalent to those established in Sec.  51.102.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Amendments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any State required to revise its implementation  plan by reason of an amendment to this section, with the exception of  amendments to add new maximum allowable increases or other measures  pursuant to section 166(a) of the Act, shall adopt and submit such plan  revision to the Administrator for approval   no later than 3 years after such amendment is published in the Federal  Register. With regard to a revision to an implementation plan by reason  of an amendment to paragraph (c) of this section to add maximum  allowable increases or other measures, the State shall submit such plan  revision to the Administrator for approval within 21 months after such  amendment is published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any revision to an implementation plan that would amend the  provisions for the prevention of significant air quality deterioration  in the plan shall specify when and as to what sources and modifications  the revision is to take effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any revision to an implementation plan that an amendment to  this section required shall take effect no later than the date of its  approval and may operate prospectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(i)</em> through (vi) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of this section apply to the construction of  any new major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an  area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under sections  107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section  apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the  major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as  this section otherwise provides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No new major stationary source or major modification to which  the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r)(5) of this section apply  shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the  major stationary source or major modification will meet those  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(a)</em> through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(7)(v)</em> and (vi) of  this section, and consistent with the definition of major modification  contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a project is a major  modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of  emissions increases--a significant emissions increase (as defined in  paragraph (b)(39) of this section), and a significant net emissions  increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(23) of this section).

Such testing must occur  at least once every 5 years after issuance of the PAL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The PAL permit shall require an  owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine  compliance with any requirement of paragraph (w) of this section and of  the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's 12-month  rolling total emissions, for 5 years from the date of such record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a  copy of the following records, for the duration of the PAL effective  period plus 5 years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for  revisions to the PAL; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to title V and  the data relied on in certifying the compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The identification of owner and operator and the permit number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Total annual emissions (tons/year) based on a 12-month rolling  total for each month in the reporting period recorded pursuant to  paragraph (w)(13)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All data relied upon, including, but not limited to, any Quality  Assurance or Quality Control data, in calculating the monthly and annual  PAL pollutant emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A list of any emissions units modified or added to the major  stationary source during the preceding 6-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The number, duration, and cause of any deviations or monitoring  malfunctions (other than the time associated with zero and span  calibration checks), and any corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A notification of a shutdown of any monitoring system, whether  the shutdown was permanent or temporary, the reason for the shutdown,  the anticipated date that the monitoring system will be fully  operational or replaced with another monitoring system, and whether the  emissions unit monitored by the monitoring system continued to operate,  and the calculation of the emissions of the pollutant or the number  determined by method included in the permit, as provided by paragraph  (w)(12)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by  the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth,  accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deviation report. The major stationary source owner or operator  shall promptly submit reports of any deviations or exceedance of the PAL  requirements, including periods where no monitoring is available. A  report submitted pursuant to Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of   this chapter shall satisfy this reporting requirement. The deviation  reports shall be submitted within the time limits prescribed by the  applicable program implementing Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of this  chapter. The reports shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The identification of owner and operator and the permit number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The PAL requirement that experienced the deviation or that was  exceeded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Emissions resulting from the deviation or the exceedance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by  the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth,  accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Re-validation results. The owner or operator shall submit to  the reviewing authority the results of any re-validation test or method  within three months after completion of such test or method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Transition requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No reviewing authority may issue a  PAL that does not comply with the requirements in paragraphs (w)(1)  through (15) of this section after the Administrator has approved  regulations incorporating these requirements into a plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reviewing authority may supersede any PAL which was  established prior to the date of approval of the plan by the  Administrator with a PAL that complies with the requirements of  paragraphs (w)(1) through (15) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If any provision of this section, or the application of such  provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder  of this section, or the application of such provision to persons or  circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not  be affected thereby.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)(1)</em>  through (3) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Capital Cost threshold for Equipment Replacement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For an  electric utility steam generating unit, as defined in Sec.  51.166(b)(30), the fixed capital cost of the replacement component(s)  plus the cost of any associated maintenance and repair activities that  are part of the replacement shall not exceed 20 percent of the  replacement value of the process unit, at the time the equipment is  replaced. For a process unit that is not an electric utility steam  generating unit the fixed capital cost of the replacement component(s)  plus the cost of any associated maintenance and repair activities that  are part of the replacement shall not exceed 20 percent of the  replacement value of the process unit, at the time the equipment is  replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the replacement value of the process unit; and,  except as otherwise allowed under paragraph (y)(1)(iii) of this section,  the owner or operator shall determine the replacement value of the  process unit on an estimate of the fixed capital cost of constructing a  new process unit, or on the current appraised value of the process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an alternative to paragraph (y)(1)(ii) of this section for  determining the replacement value of a process unit, an owner or  operator may choose to use insurance value (where the insurance value  covers only complete replacement), investment value adjusted for  inflation, or another accounting procedure if such procedure is based on  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, provided that the owner or  operator sends a notice to the reviewing authority. The first time that  an owner or operator submits such a notice for a particular process  unit, the notice may be submitted at any time, but any subsequent notice  for that process unit may be submitted only at the beginning of the  process unit's fiscal year. Unless the owner or operator submits a  notice to the reviewing authority, then paragraph (y)(1)(ii) of this  section will be used to establish the replacement value of the process  unit. Once the owner or operator submits a notice to   use an alternative accounting procedure, the owner or operator must  continue to use that procedure for the entire fiscal year for that  process unit. In subsequent fiscal years, the owner or operator must  continue to use this selected procedure unless and until the owner or  operator sends another notice to the reviewing authority selecting  another procedure consistent with this paragraph or paragraph (y)(1)(ii)  of this section at the beginning of such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Basic design parameters. The replacement does not change the  basic design parameter(s) of the process unit to which the activity  pertains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (y)(2)(iii) of this section, for  a process unit at a steam electric generating facility, the owner or  operator may select as its basic design parameters either maximum hourly  heat input and maximum hourly fuel consumption rate or maximum hourly  electric output rate and maximum steam flow rate. When establishing fuel  consumption specifications in terms of weight or volume, the minimum  fuel quality based on British Thermal Units content shall be used for  determining the basic design parameter(s) for a coal-fired electric  utility steam generating unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (y)(2)(iii) of this section,  the basic design parameter(s) for any process unit that is not at a  steam electric generating facility are maximum rate of fuel or heat  input, maximum rate of material input, or maximum rate of product  output. Combustion process units will typically use maximum rate of fuel  input. For sources having multiple end products and raw materials, the  owner or operator should consider the primary product or primary raw  material when selecting a basic design parameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the owner or operator believes the basic design  parameter(s) in paragraphs (y)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section is not  appropriate for a specific industry or type of process unit, the owner  or operator may propose to the reviewing authority an alternative basic  design parameter(s) for the source's process unit(s). If the reviewing  authority approves of the use of an alternative basic design  parameter(s), the reviewing authority shall issue a permit that is  legally enforceable that records such basic design parameter(s) and  requires the owner or operator to comply with such parameter(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator shall use credible information, such as  results of historic maximum capability tests, design information from  the manufacturer, or engineering calculations, in establishing the  magnitude of the basic design parameter(s) specified in paragraphs  (y)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If design information is not available for a process unit, then  the owner or operator shall determine the process unit's basic design  parameter(s) using the maximum value achieved by the process unit in the  five-year period immediately preceding the planned activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Efficiency of a process unit is not a basic design parameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The replacement activity shall not cause the process unit to  exceed any emission limitation, or operational limitation that has the  effect of constraining emissions, that applies to the process unit and  that is legally enforceable.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (y): By a court order on December 24, 2003, this  paragraph (y) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions will become  effective immediately if the court terminates the stay. At that time,  EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising the public  of the termination of the stay.
