The car does not require the car certificates prescribed in Sec. 174.104(c) through (f). If the doors are not tight, they must be stripped to prevent the entrance of sparks. Wood floored cars must be equipped with spark shields (see Sec. 174.104). Packages of Division 1.3 materials and Division 1.2 (explosive) materials must be blocked and braced to prevent their shifting and possible damage due to shifting of other freight during transportation.
