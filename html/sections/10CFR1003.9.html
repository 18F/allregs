                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to  all documents required or permitted to be filed with the OHA. One copy  of each document must be filed with the original, except as provided in  paragraph (f) of this section. A telefax filing of a document will be  accepted only if immediately followed by the filing by mail or hand- delivery of the original document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signing. Any document that is required to be signed, shall be  signed by the person filing the document. Any document filed by a duly  authorized representative shall contain a statement by such person  certifying that he is a duly authorized representative. (A false  certification is unlawful under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001.) The  signature by the person or duly authorized representative constitutes a  certificate by the signer that the signer has read the document and that  to the best of the signer's knowledge, information and belief formed  after reasonable inquiry, the document is well grounded in fact,  warranted under existing law, and submitted in good faith and not for  any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay. If  a document is signed in violation of this section, OHA may impose the  sanctions specified in section 1003.3 and other sanctions determined to  be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Labeling. An application, petition, or other request for action  by the OHA should be clearly labeled according to the nature of the  action involved both on the document and on the outside of the envelope  in which the document is transmitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Obligation to supply information. A person who files an  application, petition, appeal or other request for action is under a  continuing obligation during the proceeding to provide the OHA with any  new or newly discovered information that is relevant to that proceeding.  Such information includes, but is not limited to, information regarding  any other application, petition, appeal or request for action that is  subsequently filed by that person with any DOE office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The same or related matters. A person who files an application,  petition, appeal or other request for action by the OHA shall state  whether, to the best knowledge of that person, the same or related  issue, act or transaction has been or presently is being considered or  investigated by any other   DOE office, other federal agency, department or instrumentality; or by a  state or municipal agency or court; or by any law enforcement agency,  including, but not limited to, a consideration or investigation in  connection with any proceeding described in this part. In addition, the  person shall state whether contact has been made by the person or one  acting on his behalf with any person who is employed by the DOE with  regard to the same issue, act or transaction or a related issue, act or  transaction arising out of the same factual situation; the name of the  person contacted; whether the contact was verbal or in writing; the  nature and substance of the contact; and the date or dates of the  contact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for confidential treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any person filing a  document with the OHA claims that some or all of the information  contained in the document is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure  requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), is  information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905, or is otherwise exempt by law  from public disclosure, and if such person requests the OHA not to  disclose such information, such person shall file together with the  document two copies of the document from which has been deleted the  information for which such person wishes to claim confidential  treatment. The person shall indicate in the original document that it is  confidential or contains confidential information and must file a  statement specifying the justification for non-disclosure of the  information for which confidential treatment is claimed. If the person  states that the information comes within the exception codified at 5  U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial  information, such person shall include a statement specifying why such  information is privileged or confidential. If the person filing a  document does not submit two copies of the document with the  confidential information deleted, the OHA may assume that there is no  objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OHA retains the right to make its own determination with  regard to any claim of confidentiality, under criteria specified in 10  CFR 1004.11. Notice of the decision by the OHA to deny such claim, in  whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond shall be given to a  person claiming confidentiality of information no less than five days  prior to its public disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each application, petition or request for OHA action shall be  submitted as a separate document, even if the applications, petitions,  or requests deal with the same or a related issue, act or transaction,  or are submitted in connection with the same proceeding.</p>
