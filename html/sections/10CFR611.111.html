If the default is not cured during the period of grace, DOE may cause the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest thereon, and all amounts owed to the United States by Borrower pursuant to the Agreement, to become immediately due and payable by giving the Borrower written notice to such effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that the Borrower has defaulted as described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and such default is not cured during the grace period provided in the Agreement, DOE shall notify the U.S. Attorney General.

Any recovery so received by the U.S. Attorney General on behalf of the Government shall be applied in the following manner: First to the expenses incurred by the U.S. Attorney General and DOE in effecting such recovery; second, to reimbursement of any amounts paid by DOE as a result of the defaulted obligation; third, to any amounts owed to DOE under related principal and interest assistance contracts; and fourth, to any other lawful claims held by the Government on such process. Any sums remaining after full payment of the foregoing shall be available for the benefit of other parties lawfully entitled to claim them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event that DOE considers it necessary or desirable to protect or further the interest of the United States in connection with the liquidation of collateral or recovery of deficiencies due under the loan, DOE will take such action as may be appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
