                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser  and each subsequent purchaser that the new nonroad engine, including all  parts of its emission-control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time  of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may  keep it from meeting these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> only on the engine's age  (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into  service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all  your components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of  any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part  1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to  control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components  even if another company produces the component for you. Your emission- related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not  increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this  section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance  or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission- related   warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.
