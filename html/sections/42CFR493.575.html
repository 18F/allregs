                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CMS review. CMS conducts a review of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A deeming authority review of an accreditation organization's  program if the comparability or validation review produces findings, as  described at Sec. 493.573. CMS reviews, as appropriate, the criteria  described in Sec. Sec. 493.555 and 493.557(a) to reevaluate whether the  accreditation organization continues to meet all these criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exemption review of a State's licensure program if the  comparability or validation review produces findings, as described at  Sec. 493.573. CMS reviews, as appropriate, the criteria described in  Sec. Sec. 493.555 and 493.557(b) to reevaluate whether the licensure  program continues to meet all these criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A review of an accreditation organization or State licensure  program, at CMS's discretion, if validation review findings,  irrespective of the rate of disparity, indicate widespread or systematic  problems in the organization's accreditation or State's licensure  process that provide evidence that the requirements, taken as a whole,  are no longer equivalent to CLIA requirements, taken as a whole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A review of the accreditation organization or State licensure  program whenever validation inspection results indicate a rate of  disparity of 20 percent or more between the findings of the organization  or State and those of CMS or a CMS agent for the following periods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One year for accreditation organizations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two years for State licensure programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CMS action after review. Following the review, CMS may take the  following action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If CMS determines that the accreditation organization or State  has failed to adopt requirements equal to, or more stringent than, CLIA  requirements, CMS may give a conditional approval for a probationary  period of its deeming authority to an organization 30 days following the  date of CMS's determination, or exempt status to a State within 30 days  of CMS's determination, both not to exceed 1 year, to   afford the organization or State an opportunity to adopt equal or more  stringent requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CMS determines that there are widespread or systematic  problems in the organization's or State's inspection process, CMS may  give conditional approval during a probationary period, not to exceed 1  year, effective 30 days following the date of the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final determination. CMS makes a final determination as to  whether the organization or State continues to meet the criteria  described in this subpart and issues a notice that includes the reasons  for the determination to the organization or State within 60 days after  the end of any probationary period. This determination is based on an  evaluation of any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The most recent validation inspection and review findings. To  continue to be approved, the organization or State must meet the  criteria of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facility-specific data, as well as other related information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The organization's or State's inspection procedures, surveyors'  qualifications, ongoing education, training, and composition of  inspection teams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The organization's accreditation requirements, or the State's  licensure or approval requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of withdrawal of approval. CMS may withdraw its approval of  the accreditation organization or State licensure program, effective 30  days from the date of written notice to the organization or State of  this proposed action, if improvements acceptable to CMS have not been  made during the probationary period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Continuation of validation inspections. The existence of any  validation review, probationary status, or any other action, such as a  deeming authority review, by CMS does not affect or limit the conduct of  any validation inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Federal Register notice. CMS publishes a notice in the Federal  Register containing a justification for removing the deeming authority  from an accreditation organization, or the CLIA-exempt status of a State  licensure program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Withdrawal of approval-effect on laboratory status--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Accredited laboratory. After CMS withdraws approval of an accreditation  organization's deeming authority, the certificate of accreditation of  each affected laboratory continues in effect for 60 days after it  receives notification of the withdrawal of approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CLIA-exempt laboratory. After CMS withdraws approval of a State  licensure program, the exempt status of each licensed or approved  laboratory in the State continues in effect for 60 days after a  laboratory receives notification from the State of the withdrawal of  CMS's approval of the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extension. After CMS withdraws approval of an accreditation  organization or State licensure program, CMS may extend the period for  an additional 60 days for a laboratory if it determines that the  laboratory submitted an application for accreditation to an approved  accreditation organization or an application for the appropriate  certificate to CMS or a CMS agent before the initial 60-day period ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Immediate jeopardy to patients. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If at any time CMS  determines that the continued approval of deeming authority of any  accreditation organization poses immediate jeopardy to the patients of  the laboratories accredited by the organization, or continued approval  otherwise constitutes a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may  immediately withdraw the approval of deeming authority for that  accreditation organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If at any time CMS determines that the continued approval of a  State licensure program poses immediate jeopardy to the patients of the  laboratories in that State, or continued approval otherwise constitutes  a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may immediately withdraw  the approval of that State licensure program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to pay fees. CMS withdraws the approval of a State  licensure program if the State fails to pay the applicable fees, as  specified in Sec. Sec. 493.645(a) and 493.646(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> State refusal to take enforcement action. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS may withdraw  approval of a State licensure program if the State   refuses to take enforcement action against a laboratory in that State  when CMS determines it to be necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A laboratory that is in a State in which CMS has withdrawn  program approval is subject to the same requirements and survey and  enforcement processes that are applied to a laboratory that is not  exempt from CLIA requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Request for reconsideration. Any accreditation organization or  State that is dissatisfied with a determination to withdraw approval of  its deeming authority or remove approval of its State licensure program,  as applicable, may request that CMS reconsider the determination, in  accordance with subpart D of part 488.</p>
