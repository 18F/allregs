If the contractor or OPM determines that a FEGLI Program benefit has been paid in error for any reason, the contractor shall make a diligent effort to recover such erroneous payment from the recipient. The contracting officer shall allow an unrecovered erroneous payment to be charged to the contract provided the contractor demonstrates that the recovery of the erroneous payment was attempted in accordance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) and that either a diligent effort was made to recover the erroneous overpayment or it would not be cost effective to recover the erroneous overpayment. The contractor's compliance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) will be deemed to be a diligent effort to recover the erroneous overpayment.</p>
