Late payment charges may be made only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are routinely made by the lender in all types of loan transactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment has not been received within the customary timeframe allowed by the lender; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender agrees with the borrower, in writing, that the rate or method of calculating the late payment charges will not be changed to increase charges while the Loan Note Guarantee is in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guarantee fees. The guaranteed loan fee will be the applicable guarantee fee rate multiplied by the principal loan amount multiplied by the percent of guarantee. The one-time guarantee fee is paid when the Loan Note Guarantee is issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fee will be paid to the Agency by the lender and is nonreturnable.
