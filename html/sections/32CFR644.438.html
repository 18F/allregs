(For example, if the easement was acquired for a 15-year  period and the price paid therefor was substantial and one year after  acquisition it is returned to the owner of the servient estate, an  effort should be made to obtain a rebate on the purchase price although  the easement has no commercial value. The same would be applicable to  the payment for severance damages).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the owner of the servient estate, or other prospective  grantee, is not willing to pay the appraised value in consideration of  the release of an easement acquired for a substantial consideration, all  action to release the easement will be held in abeyance until such time  as an adequate consideration can be obtained for the release. Note the  minimum payment for release of spoil easments discussed in paragraph (b)  of Sec. 644.435.</p>
