                            <p class="depth0">A licensee in the 1995-2000 MHz band (Upper H Block) shall, within 30 days of grant of its long-form application, reimburse one-seventh of the eligible expenses incurred by Sprint Nextel, Inc. (Sprint) for relocating and clearing Broadcast Auxiliary Service (BAS), Cable Television Relay Service (CARS), and Local Television Transmission Service (LTTS) incumbents from the 1990-2025 MHz band, on a pro rata shared basis with other Upper H Block licensees as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> If Upper H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction for

this spectrum cover, collectively, at least forty (40) percent of the nation's population, the amount owed to Sprint by the winning bidder of each individual Upper H Block license granted as a result of the first auction will be determined by dividing the gross winning bid (GWB) for each individual Upper H Block license (i.e., an Economic Area (EA)) by the sum of the gross winning bids for all Upper H Block licenses for which there is a winning bid in the first auction, and then multiplying by $94,875,516.
RN = (EA GWB / Sum of GWBs) x $94,875,516</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If Upper H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction for

this spectrum cover, collectively, at least forty (40) percent of the nation's population, the amount owed to Sprint by the winning bidder of each individual Upper H Block license granted as a result of the first auction will be determined by dividing the gross winning bid (GWB) for each individual Upper H Block license (i.e., an Economic Area (EA)) by the sum of the gross winning bids for all Upper H Block licenses for which there is a winning bid in the first auction, and then multiplying by $94,875,516.

In this event, the same population data, e.g., 2010, used to calculate the RNs for Upper H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction will apply to subsequent auctions of Upper H Block licenses that were not granted as a result of an earlier auction of Upper H Block licenses.

This obligation will be owed to Sprint by the licensee acquiring the Upper H Block license through a subsequent auction. The amount owed by the licensee acquiring the EA license at such auction will be based on the RN calculated for the EA license based on the first auction (calculated under paragraphs (a) or (b), as applicable, of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of compliance with this section, licensees should determine population based on 2010 U.S. Census Data or such other data or measurements that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau proposes and adopts under the notice and comment process for the auction procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A payment obligation owed by a Upper H Block licensees under this section shall be made within thirty (30) days of the grant of the license (i.e., grant of the long form application).</p>
