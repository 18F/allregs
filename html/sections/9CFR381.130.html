                            <p class="depth0">If the Administrator has reason to believe that any marking or other  labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use  with respect to any article subject to the Act is false or misleading in  any particular, he may direct that the use of the article be withheld  unless it is modified in such manner as the Administrator may prescribe  so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person using or  proposing to use the labeling or container does not accept the  determination of the Administrator, he may request a hearing, but the  use of the labeling or container shall, if the Administrator so directs,  be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the Secretary in  accordance with applicable rules of practice. Any such determination  with respect to the matter by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless,  within 30 days after the receipt of notice of such final determination,  the person adversely affected thereby appeals to the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Circuit in which he has his principal place of business,  or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921,  as amended, shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.</p>
