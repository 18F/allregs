Information that the registered entity seeks to keep confidential may be redacted from the documents published on the registered entity's Web site but must be republished consistent with any determination made pursuant to Sec. 40.8(c)(4);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Include, if requested by Commission staff, additional evidence, information or data demonstrating that the contract meets, initially or on a continuing basis, the requirements of the Act, or other requirement for designation or registration under the Act, or the Commission's regulations or policies thereunder. The registered entity shall submit the requested information by the open of business on the date that is two business days from the date of request by Commission staff, or at the conclusion of such extended period agreed to by Commission staff after timely receipt of a written request from the registered entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard for review and approval. The Commission shall approve a new product unless the terms and conditions of the product violate the Act or the Commission's regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forty-five day review. All products submitted for Commission approval under this paragraph shall be deemed approved by the Commission 45 days after receipt by the Commission, or at the conclusion of an extended period as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, unless notified otherwise within the applicable period, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The submission complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The submitting entity does not amend the terms or conditions of the product or supplement the request for approval, except as requested by the Commission or for correction of typographical errors, renumbering or other non-substantive revisions, during that period. Any voluntary, substantive amendment by the submitting entity will be treated as a new submission under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extension of time. The Commission may extend the 45 day review period in paragraph (c) of this section for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An additional 45 days, if the product raises novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, in which case the Commission shall notify the registered entity within the initial 45 day review period and shall briefly describe the nature of the specific issues for which additional time for review is required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any extended review period to which the registered entity agrees in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of non-approval.
