                            <p class="depth0">You should include in your award file an agreements analysis in which you:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Briefly describe the program and detail the specific military and commercial benefits that should result from the project supported by the TIA. If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally incorporated, you should attach a copy of the signed articles of collaboration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Describe the process that led to the award of the TIA, including how you and program officials solicited and evaluated proposals and selected the one supported through the TIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Explain how you decided that a TIA was the most appropriate instrument, in accordance with the factors in Subpart B of this part. Your explanation must include your answers to the relevant questions in Sec. 37.225(a) through (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Explain how you valued the recipient's cost sharing contributions, in accordance with Secs. 37.530 through 37.555. For a fixed-support TIA, you must document the analysis you did (see Sec. 37.560) to set the fixed level of Federal support; the documentation must explain how you determined the recipient's minimum cost share and show how you estimated the expenditures required to achieve the project outcomes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Document the results of your negotiation, addressing all significant issues in the TIA's provisions. For example, this includes specific explanations if you:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify requirements for a participant's systems that vary from the standard requirements in Secs. 37.615(a), 37.625(a), 37.630, or 37.705(a) in cases where those sections provide flexibility for you to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide that any audits are to be performed by an IPA, rather than the DCAA, where permitted under Sec. 37.650. Your documentation must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The names and addresses of business units for which IPAs will be the auditors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estimated amounts of Federal funds expected under the award for those business units; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The basis (e.g., a written statement from the recipient) for your judging that the business units do not currently perform under types of awards described in Sec. 37.650(b)(1) and (2) and are not willing to grant the DCAA audit access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include an intellectual property provision that varies from Bayh-Dole requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine that cost sharing is impracticable.</p>
