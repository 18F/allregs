These categories include such matters as national defense and foreign policy information, investigatory files, internal procedures and communications, materials exempted from disclosure by other statutes, information given in confidence and matters involving personal privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Executive Order 12028 (December 4, 1977) provides that the Office of Administration shall upon request, assist the White House office in performing its role of providing those administrative services which are primarily in direct support of the President. Due to this role of providing direct support of the President, members of the public should presume that communications between the Director of the Office of Administration and the President (and their staffs) are confidential or ordinarily will not be released; they will usually fall, at a minimum, within Exemption 5 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The records of the Office of Administration which are part of systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 are exempt from disclosure to the

public except as provided by 5 CFR part 2504.
