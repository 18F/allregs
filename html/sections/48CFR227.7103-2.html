Data  needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's  economic interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes  that have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to  acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement  needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair  part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components,  or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When  it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or  government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for  competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be  identified as deliverable data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a  sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when  items or components can be acquired using performance specifications,  form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of  alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items  on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or  other request for data, data managers must balance the original  assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in  the offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever  practicable, solicitations and contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be  delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data  will be delivered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line  item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data  item on an exhibit to the contract);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item  under a fixed-price type contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each  deliverable data item; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable  item of technical data.</p>
