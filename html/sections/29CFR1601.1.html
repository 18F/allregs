Section 107 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 207 of  the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act incorporate the powers,  remedies and procedures set forth in sections 705, 706, 707, 709 and 710  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Based on its experience in the  enforcement of title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the  Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, and upon its evaluation of  suggestions and petitions for amendments submitted by interested  persons, the Commission may from time to time amend and revise these  procedures.
