Such dismissal shall be in writing and accompanied by a simple statement of the procedural or other grounds. The petitioner may obtain a review of such action by filing a request therefor with the Board in Washington, DC, and filing a copy of such request with the regional director and the other parties within 14 days from the service of notice of such dismissal. The request shall contain a complete statement setting forth the facts and reasons upon which the request is based.
