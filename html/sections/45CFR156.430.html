For each plan  variation that a QHP issuer offers on the Exchange, it must submit to  HHS, in the manner and timeframe established by HHS, for each policy,  the total allowed costs for essential health benefits charged for the  policy for the benefit year, broken down by all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount the issuer paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount the enrollee(s) paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount the enrollee(s) would have paid under the standard  plan without cost-sharing reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standard methodology. A QHP issuer must calculate the value of  the amount the enrollee(s) would have paid under the standard plan  without cost-sharing reductions by applying the actual cost-sharing  requirements for the standard plan to the allowed costs for essential  health benefits under the enrollee's policy for the benefit year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For reconciliation of cost-sharing reduction amounts advanced  for the 2014 and 2015 benefit years, an issuer of a QHP using the  standard or simplified methodology may calculate claims amounts  attributable to EHB, including cost sharing amounts attributable to EHB,  by reducing total claims amounts by the plan-specific percentage  estimate of non-essential health benefit claims submitted on the Uniform  Rate Review Template for the corresponding benefit year, if the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The non-essential health benefits percentage estimate is less  than 2 percent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Out-of-pocket expenses for non-EHB benefits are included in the  calculation of amounts subject to a deductible or annual limitation on  cost sharing, but copayments and coinsurance rates on non-EHB benefits  are not reduced under the plan variation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Selection of methodology.

For the next benefit year  (if such benefit year is 2015 or 2016), the QHP issuer may select the  simplified methodology (subject to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section  but, for that benefit year, not paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section)  or the standard methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For plan variation policies with total allowed costs for EHB for  the benefit year that are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Less than or equal to the effective deductible, the amount that  the enrollees would have paid under the standard plan is equal to the  total allowed costs for EHB under the policy for the benefit year  multiplied by the effective pre-deductible coinsurance rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Greater than the effective deductible but less than the  effective claims ceiling, the amount that the enrollees would have paid  under the standard plan is equal to the sum of (x) the average  deductible, plus (y) the effective non-deductible cost sharing, plus (z)  the difference, if positive, between the total allowed costs under the  policy for the benefit year for EHB that are subject to a deductible and  the average deductible, multiplied by the effective post-deductible  coinsurance rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Greater than or equal to the effective claims ceiling, the  amount that the enrollees would have paid under the standard plan is  equal to the annual limitation on cost sharing for the standard plan (as  defined at 45 CFR 156.400), or, at the QHP issuer's election on a  policy-by-policy basis, the amount calculated pursuant to the standard  methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The QHP issuer must calculate one or more sets of effective  cost-sharing parameters, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this  section, based on policies assigned to the standard plan without cost- sharing reductions for the entire benefit year and must separately apply  each set of effective cost-sharing parameters to the corresponding  subgroup of total allowed costs for EHB for each plan variation policy,  as described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the standard plan has separate cost-sharing parameters for  self-only coverage and other than self-only coverage, but does not have  separate cost-   sharing parameters for pharmaceutical and medical services, the QHP  issuer must calculate and apply separate sets of effective cost-sharing  parameters based on the costs of enrollees in the standard plan with  self-only coverage, and based on the costs of enrollees in the standard  plan with other than self-only coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the standard plan has separate cost-sharing parameters for  pharmaceutical and medical services, but does not have separate cost- sharing parameters for self-only coverage and other than self-only  coverage, the QHP issuer must calculate and apply separate sets of  effective cost-sharing parameters based on the medical costs of the  enrollees in the standard plan, and based on the pharmaceutical costs of  the enrollees in the standard plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the standard plan has separate cost-sharing parameters for  self-only coverage and other than self-only coverage, and also has  separate cost-sharing parameters for pharmaceutical and medical  services, the QHP issuer must calculate and apply separate sets of  effective cost-sharing parameters based on the medical costs of  enrollees in the standard plan with self-only coverage, based on the  pharmaceutical costs of enrollees in the standard plan with self-only  coverage, based on the medical costs of enrollees in the standard plan  with other than self-only coverage, and based on the pharmaceutical  costs of enrollees in the standard plan with other than self-only  coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The effective cost-sharing parameters for the standard plan  without cost-sharing reductions must be calculated based on policies  assigned to the standard plan for the entire benefit year for each of  the required subgroups under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the standard plan has only one deductible (for the applicable  subgroup), the average deductible of the standard plan is that  deductible amount.

Services that are not subject to any deductible (including  services subject to copayments or coinsurance but not any deductible)  are not to be incorporated into the calculation of the average  deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The effective non-deductible cost sharing for the applicable  subgroup is the average portion of total allowed costs for EHB that are  not subject to any deductible for the standard plan for the benefit year  incurred for standard plan enrollees and payable by the enrollees as  cost sharing.

The average total allowed costs for EHB that are not  subject to any deductible for the standard plan for the benefit year  must be calculated based only on standard plan policies with total  allowed costs for EHB for the benefit year that are above the average  deductible but for which associated cost sharing for EHB is less than  the annual limitation on cost sharing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The effective pre-deductible coinsurance rate for the applicable  subgroup is the proportion of the total allowed costs for EHB under the  standard plan for the benefit year incurred for standard plan enrollees  and payable as cost sharing.
