                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 543.205, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Equitable Adjustments (JAN 2009)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This clause governs the determination of equitable adjustments  to which the Contractor may be entitled under the ``Changes'' clause  prescribed by FAR 52.243-4, the ``Differing Site Conditions'' clause  prescribed by FAR 52.236-2, and any other provision of this contract  allowing entitlement to an equitable adjustment. This clause does not  govern determination of the Contractor's relief allowable under the  ``Suspension of Work'' clause prescribed by FAR 52.242-14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the written request of the Contracting Officer, the  Contractor shall submit a proposal, in accordance with the requirements  set forth herein, for an equitable adjustment to the contract for  changes or other conditions that may entitle a Contractor to an  equitable adjustment. If the Contractor deems an oral or written order  to be a change to the contract, it shall promptly submit to the  Contracting Officer a proposal for equitable adjustment attributable to  such deemed change. The proposal shall also conform to the requirements  set forth herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The proposal shall be submitted within the time specified in the  ``Changes'' clause, or such other time as may reasonably be required by  the Contracting Officer. In the case of a proposal submitted based on  the ``Differing Site Conditions'' clause, the notice requirement of that  clause shall be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proposals for equitable adjustments, including no cost requests  for adjustment of the contract's required completion date, shall include  a detailed breakdown of the following elements, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Markups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Change to the time for completion specified in the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Direct costs. The Contractor shall separately identify each item  of deleted and added work associated with the change or other condition  giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, including  increases or decreases to unchanged work impacted by the change. For  each item of work so identified, the Contractor shall propose for itself  and, if applicable, its first two tiers of subcontractors, the following  direct costs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material cost broken down by trade, supplier, material  description, quantity of material units, and unit cost (including all  manufacturing burden associated with material fabrication and cost of  delivery to site, unless separately itemized);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Labor cost broken down by trade, employer, occupation, quantity  of labor hours, and burdened hourly labor rate, together with  itemization of applied labor burdens (exclusive of employer's overhead,  profit, and any labor cost burdens carried in employer's overhead rate);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost of equipment required to perform the work, identified with  material to be placed or operation to be performed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost of preparation and/or revision to shop drawings and other  submittals with detail set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this  clause;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Delivery costs, if not included in material unit costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Time-related costs not separately identified as direct costs,  and not included in the Contractor's or subcontractors' overhead rates,  as specified in paragraph (g) of this clause; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other direct costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Marked-up costs of subcontractors below the second tier may be  treated as other direct costs of a second tier subcontractor, unless the  Contracting Officer requires a detailed breakdown under paragraph (i) of  this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Extensions of Time and Time-Related Costs. The Contractor shall  propose a daily rate for each firm's time-related costs during the  affected period, and, for each firm, the increase or decrease in the  number of work days of performance attributable to the change or other  condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, with  supporting analysis. Entitlement to time and time-related costs shall be  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increases or decreases to a firm's time-related costs shall be  allowed only if such increase or decrease necessarily and exclusively  results from the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to  an equitable adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or  recovery of its own time-related costs except to the extent that such  change or other condition necessarily and exclusively causes its  duration of performance to extend beyond the completion date specified  in the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs may be characterized as time-related costs only if they  are incurred solely to support performance of this contract and the  increase or decrease in such costs is solely dependent upon the duration  of a firm's performance of work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Costs may not be characterized as time-related costs if they are  included in the calculation of a firm's overhead rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Equitable adjustment of time and time-related costs shall not be  allowed unless the analysis supporting the proposal complies with  provisions specified elsewhere in this contract regarding the  Contractor's project schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Markups. For each firm whose direct costs are separately  identified in the proposal, the Contractor shall propose an overhead  rate, profit rate, and where applicable, a bond rate and insurance rate.  Markups shall be determined and applied as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Overhead rates shall be negotiated, and may be subject to audit  and adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Profit rates shall be negotiated, but shall not exceed ten  percent, unless entitlement to a higher rate of profit may be  demonstrated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor and its subcontractor[s] shall not be allowed  overhead or profit on the overhead or profit received by a  subcontractor, except to the extent that the subcontractor's costs are  properly included in other direct costs as specified in paragraph (f) of  this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Overhead rates shall be applied to the direct costs of work  performed by a firm, and shall not be allowed on the direct costs of  work performed by a subcontractor to that firm at any tier except as set  forth below in paragraphs (h)(6) and (h)(7) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Profit rates shall be applied to the sum of a firm's direct  costs and the overhead allowed on the direct costs of work performed by  that firm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Overhead and profit shall be allowed on the direct costs of work  performed by a subcontractor within two tiers of a firm at rates equal  to only fifty percent of the overhead and profit rates negotiated  pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this clause for that firm,  but not in excess of ten percent when combined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Overhead and profit shall not be allowed on the direct costs of  a subcontractor more than two tiers below the firm claiming overhead and  profit for subcontractor direct costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If changes to a Contractor's or subcontractor's bond or  insurance premiums are computed as a percentage of the gross change in  contract value, markups for bond and insurance shall be applied after  all overhead and profit is applied. Bond and insurance rates shall not  be applied if the associated costs are included in the calculation of a  firm's overhead rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> No markup shall be applied to a firm's costs other than those  specified herein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall  provide such other information as may be reasonably necessary to allow  evaluation of the proposal. If the proposal includes significant costs  incurred by a subcontractor below the second tier, the Contracting  Officer may require the same detail for those costs as required for the  first two tiers of subcontractors, and markups shall be applied to these  subcontractor costs in accordance with paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Proposal Preparation Costs. If performed by the firm claiming  them, proposal preparations costs shall be included in the labor hours  proposed as direct costs. If performed by an outside consultant or law  firm, proposal preparation costs shall be treated as other direct costs  to the firm incurring them. Requests for proposal preparation costs  shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the contract or other documentation identifying the  consultant or firm, the scope of the services performed, the manner in  which the consultant or firm was to be compensated, and if compensation  was paid on an hourly basis, the fully burdened and marked-up hourly  rates for the services provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If compensation was paid on an hourly basis, documentation of  the quantity of hours worked, including descriptions of the activities  for which the hours were billed, and applicable rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written proof of payment of the costs requested. The sufficiency  of the proof shall be determined by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Proposal preparation costs shall be allowed only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature and complexity of the change or other condition  giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment warrants  estimating, scheduling, or other effort not reasonably foreseeable at  the time of contract award;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed costs are not included in a firm's time-related costs  or overhead rate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proposed costs were incurred prior to a Contracting Officer's  unilateral determination of an equitable adjustment under the conditions  set forth in paragraph (o), or were incurred prior to the time the  request for equitable adjustment otherwise became a matter in dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Proposed direct costs, markups, and proposal preparation costs  shall be allowable in the determination of an equitable adjustment only  if they are reasonable and otherwise consistent with the contract cost  principles and procedures set forth in part 31 of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 31) in effect on the date of this  contract. Characterization of costs as direct costs, time-related costs,  or overhead costs must be   consistent with the requesting firm's accounting practices on other work  under this contract and other contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the  Government's interest that the Contractor proceed with a change before  negotiation of an equitable adjustment is completed, the Contracting  Officer may order the Contractor to proceed on the basis of a unilateral  modification to the contract increasing or decreasing the contract price  by an amount to be determined later. Such increase or decrease shall not  exceed the increase or decrease proposed by the Contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> If the parties cannot agree to an equitable adjustment, the  Contracting Officer may determine the equitable adjustment unilaterally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The Contractor shall not be entitled to any proposal preparation  costs incurred subsequent to the date of a unilateral determination or  denial of the request if the Contracting Officer issues a unilateral  determination or denial under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor fails to submit a proposal within the time  required by this contract or such time as may reasonably be required by  the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor fails to submit additional information requested  by the Contracting Officer within the time reasonably required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agreement to an equitable adjustment cannot be reached within 60  days of submission of the Contractor's proposal or receipt of additional  requested information, despite the Contracting Officer's diligent  efforts to negotiate the equitable adjustment.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)  [74 FR 864, Jan. 9, 2009]</p>
