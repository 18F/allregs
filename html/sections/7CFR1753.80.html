                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the borrower performs minor construction financed with loan  funds, the borrower's regular work order procedure shall be used to  administer construction activities that may be performed entirely by a  contractor under Form 773 contract, by work order, or jointly by work  order and one or more contractors under Form 773 contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS financing under Form 773 contracts dated in the same  calendar year is limited to the following amounts for the following  discrete categories of minor construction. The date of the Form 773  contract is the date the Form 773 contract is executed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For outside plant construction, the limit is $500,000 or ten per  cent (10%) of the borrower's previous calendar year's outside plant  total construction, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For central office equipment, the limit is $500,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For special equipment and buildings, the limit is $250,000 in  each category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A single minor construction project may be a discrete element of  a somewhat larger overall project, such as the provision and  installation of a standby power generator or heating/air conditioning  equipment in connection with a building modification or expansion  project or the splicing on a major cable placement project. It cannot be  a portion, by dividing into smaller segments, of a discrete major  construction project, such as the placement of a continuous cable  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS approval must be obtained in advance for minor construction  unless all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RUS has approved the engineering design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All standard RUS procedures are followed, including use of new  materials listed in the List of Materials for Use on Telephone Systems  of RUS Borrowers (Bul. 344-2) and the application of RUS construction  practices. (See Sec. 1753.6)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Standard Form 773 contract is used without modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The borrower shall determine the scope of each proposed  construction project and decide how it will be constructed. A work  project number shall be assigned to which all charges for that project  are referenced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The borrower shall maintain accounting and plant records  sufficient to document the cost and location of all construction and to  support loan fund advances and disbursements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Normally the borrower will finance minor construction with  general funds and obtain reimbursement with loan funds when construction  is completed and executed Form 771 has been submitted to RUS. If a  borrower satisfies RUS of its inability to finance the construction  temporarily with general funds, RUS may establish, on a case by case  basis, a work order fund for specific construction projects. The work  order fund will be closed upon receipt of an FRS and the executed Forms  771   for the specific projects for which the work order fund was established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> RUS will advance funds to finance minor construction work  projects only if all necessary documents, including an FRS and  supporting data covering the project, are received within one year of  the date construction of the project is completed.
