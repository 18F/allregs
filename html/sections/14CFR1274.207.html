                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Multiple year cooperative agreements are encouraged, but normally they should span no more than three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperative agreements that will exceed $5 million and have a period of

performance in excess of 5 years shall require the approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement prior to award. Requests for approval shall include a justification for exceeding 5 years and evidence that the extended years can be reasonably priced. Requests for approval are not required when the 5-year limitation is exceeded due to a no cost extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cooperative agreement renewals provide for the continuation of research beyond the original scope, period of performance and funding levels; therefore, new proposals, certifications, and technical evaluations are required prior to the execution of a cooperative agreement renewal. Renewals will be awarded as new cooperative agreements. Continued performance within a period specified under a multiple year cooperative agreement provision does not constitute a renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions set forth in Sec. 1274.901 are generally considered appropriate for agreements not exceeding 3 years and/or a Government cash contribution not exceeding $20M. For cooperative agreements expected to be longer than 3 years and/or involve Government cash contributions exceeding $20M, consideration should be given to provisions which place additional restrictions on the recipient in terms of validating performance and accounting for funds expended.
