                                Sec. 205.374  Responses from ``entities'' designated in the application.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each ``entity'' designated as a potential source of emergency  assistance or as a potential supplier of transmission services and which  has received a copy of the application under Sec. 205.373, shall have  three (3) calendar days from the time of receipt of the application to  file the information designated below with the DOE. The DOE will grant  extensions of the filing period when appropriate. The designated  ``entities'' shall provide an analysis of the impact the requested  action would have on its system reliability and its ability to supply  its own interruptible and firm customers. The effects of the requested  action on the ability to serve firm loads shall be clearly distinguished  from the ability to serve contractually interruptible loads. The  designated ``entity'' also may provide other information relevant to the  requested action, which is not included in the reliability analysis.  Copies of any response shall be provided to the applicant, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, any State Regulatory Agency having  responsibility for service standards or rates of any ``entity'' that may  be directly involved in the proposed action, and the appropriate  Regional Electric Reliability Council. Pursuant to section 202(c) of the  Federal Power Act, DOE may issue an emergency order even though a  designated ``entity'' has failed to file a timely response.</p>
