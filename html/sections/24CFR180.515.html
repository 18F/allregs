                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice. Upon written notice to the witness and to all other  parties, a party may take the testimony of a witness by deposition and  may request the production of specified documents or materials by the  witness at the deposition. Notice of the taking of a deposition shall be  given not less than five days before the deposition is scheduled. The  notice shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose and general scope of the deposition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time and place of the deposition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name and address of the person before whom the deposition is  to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the witness; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A specification of the documents and materials that the witness  is requested to produce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deposition of an organization. If the deposition of a public or  private corporation, partnership, association, or governmental agency is  sought, the organization so named shall designate one or more officers,  directors or agents to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for  each person designated, the matters on which he/she will testify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure at deposition. Depositions may be taken before any  disinterested person having power to administer oaths in the location  where the deposition is to be taken. Each deponent shall be placed under  oath or affirmation, and the other parties will have the right to cross- examine. The deponent may have counsel present during the deposition.  The questions propounded and all answers and objections thereto shall be  reduced to writing, read by or to and subscribed by the witness, and  certified by the person before whom the deposition was taken. Non- intervening aggrieved persons may be present at depositions in which  they are not the deponent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Motion to terminate or limit examination. During the taking of a  deposition, a party or the witness may request suspension of the  deposition on the grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the  examination, oppression of the witness or party, or improper questioning  or conduct. Upon request for suspension, the deposition will be  adjourned. The objecting party or witness must immediately move the ALJ  for a   ruling on the objection. The ALJ may then limit the scope or manner of  taking the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver of deposing officer's disqualification. Objection to  taking a deposition because of the disqualification of the officer  before whom it is taken is waived unless made before the taking of the  deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes  known or could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment of costs of deposition. The party requesting the  deposition shall bear all costs of the deposition.</p>
