This may involve routing vapors through a carbon canister. If another company has certified the engine with respect to exhaust emissions, state in your application for certification that you have followed the engine manufacturer's installation instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use a fuel tank that remains sealed under normal operating conditions. This may involve a bladder or other means to prevent pressurized fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Get an approved Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board showing that your system meets applicable running loss standards in California.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are subject to both running loss and diurnal emission standards, use good engineering judgment to ensure that the emission controls are compatible.</p>
