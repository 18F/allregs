Any notice of a revision  received by the agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the  contract shall be effective, if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The contract does not specify a start of performance date which  is within 30 days from the award; and/or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Performance of such procurement does not commence within this  30-day period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In situations arising under section 4(c) of the Act, the  provisions in Sec. 4.1b(b) apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of using WDOL databases containing prevailing wage  determinations, the date of receipt by the contracting agency will be  the date of publication on the WDOL Web site or on the date the agency  receives actual notice of an initial or revised wage determination from  the Department of Labor through the e98 process, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>, (3), and (4) of this section: To avoid serious  impairment of the conduct of Government business it has been found  necessary and proper to provide exemption from the determined wage and  fringe benefits section of the Act (section 2(a)(1), (2)) but not the  minimum wage specified under section 6(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Fair Labor Standards  Act of 1938, as amended (section 2(b) of this Act), of contracts under  which five or less service employees are to be employed, and for which  no such wage or fringe benefit determination has been issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exemption provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  which was adopted pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its  amendment by Public Law 92-473, does not extend to undetermined wages or  fringe benefits in contracts for which one or more, but not all, classes  of service employees are the subject of an applicable wage  determination. The procedure for determination of wage rates and fringe  benefits for any classes of service employees engaged in performing such  contracts whose wages and fringe benefits are not specified in the  applicable wage determination is set forth in Sec. 4.6(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The exemption provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section does  not exempt any contract from the application of the provisions of  section 4(c) of the Act as amended, concerning successor contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exemption provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section does  not apply to any contract for which section 10 of the Act as amended  requires an applicable wage determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the Department of Labor discovers and determines, whether  before or subsequent to a contract award, that a contracting agency made  an erroneous determination that the Service Contract Act did not apply  to a particular procurement and/or failed to include an appropriate wage  determination in a covered contract, the contracting agency, within 30  days of notification by the Department of Labor, shall include in the  contract the stipulations contained in Sec. 4.6 and any applicable wage  determination issued by the Administrator or his authorized  representative through the exercise of any and all authority that may be  needed (including, where necessary, its authority to negotiate or amend,  its authority to pay any necessary additional costs, and its authority  under any contract provision authorizing changes,   cancellation, and termination). With respect to any contract subject to  section 10 of the Act, the Administrator may require retroactive  application of such wage determination. (See 53 Comp.
