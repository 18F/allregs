In addition, any transfer or donation documentation for four-wheeled ATVs must require the recipient to acknowledge that the recipient will follow regulations and guidelines published by the Consumer Product Safety Commission related to these items, including age recommendations, restrictions on usage, and operator training. Four-wheeled ATVs not exchanged, transferred, or donated may be offered for sale as either salvage or scrap only after they have been mutilated in a manner to prevent operational use. Four-wheeled ATVs must not be released to the public after donee use, nor may they be released to the public after Federal use if the ATVs are not donated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A donation transfer document must contain a full description of the actual or potential hazard(s) and restriction(s) associated with the handling, storage, use, transportation or disposal of the item. In addition, the following certification (or an equivalent) must be signed by the donee:</p><p class="depth2">I (We), the undersigned, hereby certify that the donee has knowledge and understanding of the nature of the property hereby donated which requires special handling, and will comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations with respect to the care, handling, storage, shipment, and disposal of the property.
