                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 9.206-2, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Qualification Requirements (FEB 1995)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition: Qualification Requirement, as used in this clause,  means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance  demonstration that must be completed before award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or  services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services  requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an  end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the  product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets  the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this  contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the  time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or  source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified  manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact  the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that  they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their  products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange  for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards  specified for qualification.  (Name)__________________________________________________________________ (Address)_______________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered  by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified,  the relevant information noted below should be provided.  Offeror's Name__________________________________________________________   Manufacturer's Name_____________________________________________________ Source's Name___________________________________________________________ Item Name_______________________________________________________________ Service Identification__________________________________________________ Test Number_____________________________________________________________ (to the extent known)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Even though a product or service subject to a qualification  requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product,  manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of  award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a  subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in  question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an  applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of  award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for  default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is  offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's  best interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met  the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products  list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the  offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this  contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of  this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit  evidence of qualification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a  previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed  requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in  location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source  requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be  accomplished before the date of award.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [53 FR 34229, Sept. 2, 1988; 53 FR 36028, Sept. 16, 1988, as amended at  59 FR 67056, Dec. 28, 1994]</p>
