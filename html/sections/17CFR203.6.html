A person  who has submitted documentary evidence or testimony in a formal  investigative proceeding shall be entitled, upon written request, to  procure a copy of his documentary evidence or a transcript of his  testimony on payment of the appropriate fees: Provided, however, That in  a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding the Commission may for good  cause deny such request. In any event, any witness, upon proper  identification, shall have the right to inspect the official transcript  of the witness' own testimony.  (15 U.S.C. 78d-1)  [37 FR 25166, Nov. 28, 1972]</p>
