                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A qualifying hospital (as defined in this subpart)  must receive the special incentive payment as determined under the  formulas described in paragraph (c) of this section for the period  specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transition periods. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section and  the payment formula specified in paragraph (c) of this section,  qualifying hospitals may receive incentive payments during transition  periods which comprise the following fiscal years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2011 may receive such  payments for FYs 2011 through 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2012 may receive such  payments for FYs 2012 through 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2013 may receive such  payments for FYs 2013 through 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2014 may receive such  payments for FY 2014 through 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Hospitals whose first payment year is FY 2015 may receive such  payments for FY 2015 through 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payment methodology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The incentive payment for each payment  year is calculated as the product of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The initial amount determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Medicare share fraction determined under paragraph (c)(4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transition factor determined under paragraph (c)(5) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim and final payments. CMS uses data on hospital acute care  inpatient discharges, Medicare Part A acute care inpatient bed-days,  Medicare Part C acute care inpatient bed-days, and total acute care  inpatient bed-days from the latest submitted 12-month hospital cost  report as the basis for making preliminary incentive payments. Final  payments are determined at the time of settling the first 12-month  hospital cost report for the hospital fiscal year that begins on or  after the first day of the payment year, and settled on the basis of  data from that cost reporting period. In cases where there is no 12- month hospital cost report period beginning on or after the first day of  the payment year, final payments may be determined and settled on the  basis of data from the most recently submitted 12-month hospital cost  report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Initial amount. The initial amount is equal to one of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each hospital with 1,149 acute care inpatient discharges or  fewer, $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each hospital with at least 1,150 but no more than 23,000  acute care inpatient discharges, $2,000,000 + [$200 x (n - 1,149)],  where n is the number of discharges for the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each hospital with more than 23,000 acute care inpatient  discharges, $6,370,200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Medicare share fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CMS determines the  Medicare share fraction for an eligible hospital by using the number of  Medicare Part A, Medicare Part C, and total acute care inpatient-bed- days using data from the Medicare cost report as specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> CMS computes the denominator of the Medicare share fraction  using the charity care charges reported on the hospital's Medicare cost  report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Medicare share fraction is the ratio of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A numerator which is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number of inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to  individuals with respect to whom payment may be   made under Part A, including individuals enrolled in section 1876  Medicare cost plans; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of inpatient-bed-days which are attributable to  individuals who are enrolled with a Medicare Advantage organization (as  defined in Sec. 422.2 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A denominator which is the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total number of acute care inpatient-bed-days; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total amount of the eligible hospital's charges, not  including any charges that are attributable to charity care, divided by  the estimated total amount of the hospitals charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transition factor.

After the  first payment year, an eligible hospital will not receive an incentive  payment for any payment year during which it is not a qualifying  hospital.
