                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manner of making changes. An amendment is a change in, addition  to, or cancellation of part of a tariff. Supplements are the tariff  publications used to amend bound tariffs, and new or revised pages are  the tariff publications normally used to amend looseleaf tariffs,  although looseleaf tariffs can also be amended by supplements. Tariffs  can also be canceled by new or reissued tariffs (see Sec.  1312.7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supplements. Supplements issued to amend a tariff shall be  consecutively numbered. Each new supplement shall identify any  supplement(s) that it cancels, and any supplement(s) that are still in  effect. A tariff amendment published in a supplement may be carried  forward to later supplements if it is identified as reissued without  change from the supplement in which it was originally published.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Looseleaf pages. Looseleaf pages to an original tariff shall be  designated as ``Original'' (e.g., Original Title Page, Original Page 1,  Original Page 2, etc.). Looseleaf pages issued to amend the tariff shall  bear consecutive revision numbers and shall cancel the prior version(s)  of the same page (e.g., 1st Revised Page 1 Cancels Original Page 1, 2nd  Revised Page 1 Cancels 1st Revised Page 1, etc.). Additional original  pages may also be issued to amend a tariff, by adding new numbered pages  after the last numbered page, or by adding existing numbered pages with  alphabetic suffixes (e.g., a page designated as Original Page 2-A could  be added between pages 2 and 3, etc.). Each looseleaf tariff shall  include a Check Sheet, a Correction Number Check Sheet, or some other  method of determining the looseleaf pages issued to amend such tariff.</p>
