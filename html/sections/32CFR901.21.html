                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification of candidates selected for appointment are  furnished by USAFA/RRS to HQ USAF/DPPA. HQ USAF/DPPA notifies Members of  Congress and the Vice President of offers of appointment. After HQ USAF/ DPPA notifies the nominating sources and advises USAFA/RRS that  notification has been completed, USAFA/RRS notifies each appointee  (civilian, Regular or Reserve service member) by letter, enclosing an  acceptance or declination statement form. On receipt of an acceptance  statement for each unconditional offer of appointment, USAFA/RRS  forwards the completed candidate file to Cadet Examinations and Records  (USAFA/RR). Conditional offers of appointment that have been accepted  are held by USAFA/RRS until the conditional factor is resolved--medical  status cleared, satisfactory preparatory school or college transcript  received, proof of citizenship provided, etc. HQ USAF/DPPA is notified  of removal of conditional status from offer of appointment in order to  notify nominating sources as stated above. USAFA/RR completes admissions  in-processing by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Forwarding an appointment kit which includes detailed reporting  instructions to each appointee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issuing invitation to travel orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notifying the Directorate of Cadet Personnel (USAFA/DPYC) of  Regular airmen appointees. Regular airmen in technical school completes  all phases of training, if time permits, before reporting to the  Academy. On graduation, the airmen remain at the technical school in  casual status (unless otherwise directed by HQ AFMPC/MPCRAC1) until  earliest reporting date for the Academy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board  (DODMERB) notifies applicants of their medical status. USAFA/RRS informs  HQ USAF/DPPA of changes in medical status of candidates offered  conditional appointments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> USAFA/RRS notifies each unsuccessful candidate by May 1. For  active duty Air Force personnel, the servicing CBPO also is notified and  cancels the airman's Assignment Availability Code 05.</p>
