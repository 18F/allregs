In particular, Customs must be advised when any transaction described in the advance ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office. In addition, any person engaged in a NAFTA transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office who has previously requested a NAFTA advance ruling with respect to that transaction must advise the field office of that fact.</p>
