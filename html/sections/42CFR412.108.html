                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for classification as a Medicare-dependent, small rural  hospital--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General considerations. For cost reporting periods  beginning on or after April 1, 1990, and ending before October 1, 1994,  or for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before  October 1, 2017, a hospital is classified as a Medicare-dependent, small  rural hospital if it is located in a rural area (as defined in subpart D  of this part) and meets all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The hospital has 100 or fewer beds as defined in Sec.  412.105(b) during the cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The hospital is not also classified as a sole community  hospital under Sec. 412.92.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 60 percent of the hospital's inpatient days or  discharges were attributable to individuals entitled to Medicare Part A  benefits during the hospital's cost reporting period or periods as  follows, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this  section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hospital's cost reporting period ending on or after  September 30, 1987 and before September 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the hospital does not have a cost reporting period that meets  the criterion set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the  hospital's cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986,  and before October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> At least two of the last three most recent audited cost  reporting periods for which the Secretary has a settled cost report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the cost reporting period determined under paragraph  (a)(1)(iii) of this section is for less than 12 months, the hospital's  most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period before the short  period is used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counting days and discharges. In counting inpatient days and  discharges for purposes of meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)  of this section, only days and discharges from acute care inpatient  hospital stays are counted (including days and discharges from swing  beds when used for acute care inpatient hospital services), but not  including days and discharges from units excluded from the prospective  payment system under Sec. Sec. 412.25 through 412.30 or from newborn  nursery units. For purposes of this section, a transfer as defined in  Sec. 412.4(b) is considered to be a discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fiscal intermediary  determines whether a hospital meets the criteria specified in paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A hospital must submit a written request along with qualifying  documentation to its fiscal intermediary to be considered for MDH status  based on the criterion under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fiscal intermediary will make its determination and notify  the hospital within 90 days from the date that it receives the  hospital's request and all of the required documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A determination of MDH status made by the fiscal intermediary is  effective 30 days after the date the fiscal intermediary provides  written notification to the hospital. An approved MDH status  determination remains in effect unless there is a change in the  circumstances under which the status was approved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An approved MDH must notify the fiscal intermediary if any  change occurs that is specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section  occurs. If CMS determines that an MDH failed to comply with this  requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as an MDH  effective with the date that the hospital no longer met the criteria for  such status, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 405.1885 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An MDH must report the following to the fiscal intermediary  within 30 days of the event:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of beds increases to more than 100.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Its geographic classification changes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An MDH must report to the fiscal intermediary if it becomes  aware of any change that would affect its classification as an MDH  beyond the events listed in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section within  30 days of the event. If CMS determines that an MDH has failed to comply  with this requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as  an MDH effective with the date the hospital became aware of the event  that resulted in the MDH no longer meeting the criteria for such  classification, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 405.1885 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The fiscal intermediary will evaluate on an ongoing basis,  whether or not a hospital continues to qualify for MDH status. This  evaluation includes an ongoing review to ensure that the hospital  continues to meet all of the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the fiscal intermediary determines that a hospital no longer  qualifies for MDH status, the change in status will become effective 30  days after the date the fiscal intermediary provides written  notification to the hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A hospital may reapply for MDH status following its  disqualification only after it has completed another cost reporting  period that has been audited and settled. The hospital must reapply for  MDH status in writing to its fiscal intermediary and submit the required  documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a hospital disagrees with an intermediary's determination  regarding the hospital's initial or ongoing MDH status, the hospital may  notify its fiscal intermediary and submit other documentable evidence to  support its claim that it meets the MDH qualifying criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The fiscal intermediary's initial and ongoing determination is  subject to review under subpart R of Part 405 of this chapter. The time  required by the fiscal intermediary to review the request is considered  good cause for granting an extension of the time limit for the hospital  to apply for that review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal payment rate applicable to the hospital, as  determined under subpart D of this part, subject to the regional floor  defined in Sec. 412.70(c)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount, if any, determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For discharges occurring during the first three 12-month cost  reporting periods that begin on or after April 1, 1990, 100 percent of  the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section is exceeded by the higher of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For discharges occurring during any subsequent cost reporting  period   (or portion thereof) and before October 1, 1994, and for discharges  occurring on or after October 1, 1997 and before October 1, 2006, 50  percent of the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the higher of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For discharges occurring during cost reporting periods (or  portions thereof) beginning on or after October 1, 2006, and before  October 1, 2017, 75 percent of the amount that the Federal rate  determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the  highest of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.79.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional payments to hospitals experiencing a significant  volume decrease. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS provides for a payment adjustment for a  Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital for any cost reporting period  during which the hospital experiences, due to circumstances as described  in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a more than 5 percent decrease in  its total inpatient discharges as compared to its immediately preceding  cost reporting period. If either the cost reporting period in question  or the immediately preceding cost reporting period is other than a 12- month cost reporting period, the intermediary must convert the  discharges to a monthly figure and multiply this figure by 12 to  estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost reporting  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To qualify for a payment adjustment on the basis of a decrease  in discharges, a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital must submit  its request no later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's  Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement and it must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit to the intermediary documentation demonstrating the size  of the decrease in discharges and the resulting effect on per discharge  costs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Show that the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the  hospital's control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The intermediary determines a lump sum adjustment amount not to  exceed the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient  operating costs and the hospital's total DRG revenue for inpatient  operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for  inpatient operating costs (including outlier payments for inpatient  operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional  payments made for inpatient operating costs hospitals that serve a  disproportionate share of low-income patients as determined under Sec.  412.106 and for indirect medical education costs as determined under  Sec. 412.105).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In determining the adjustment amount, the intermediary  considers--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the  reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view  of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those  costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in  utilization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The intermediary makes its determination within 180 days from  the date it receives the hospital's request and all other necessary  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The intermediary determination is subject to review under  subpart R of part 405 of this chapter. The time required by the  intermediary to review the request is considered good cause for granting  an extension of the time limit for the hospital to apply for that  review.
