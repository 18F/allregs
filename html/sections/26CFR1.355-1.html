                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective/applicability date of certain sections. Except as  otherwise provided, this section and Sec. Sec. 1.355-2 through 1.355-4  apply to transactions   occurring after February 6, 1989. For transactions occurring on or  before that date, see 26 CFR 1.355-1 through 1.355-4 (revised as of  April 1, 1987). This section and Sec. Sec. 1.355-2 through 1.355-4,  other than Sec. 1.355-2(g) and (i), do not reflect the amendments to  section 355 made by the Revenue Act of 1987, the Technical and  Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the Tax Technical Corrections Act  of 2007. For the applicability date of Sec. Sec. 1.355-2(g), 1.355-5,  1.355-6, and 1.355-7, see Sec. Sec. 1.355-2(i), 1.355-5(e), 1.355-6(g),  and 1.355-7(k), respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of section. Section 355 provides for the separation,  without recognition of gain or loss to (or the inclusion in income of)  the shareholders and security holders, of one or more existing  businesses formerly operated, directly or indirectly, by a single  corporation (the ``distributing corporation''). It applies only to the  separation of existing businesses that have been in active operation for  at least five years (or a business that has been in active operation for  at least five years into separate businesses), and which, in general,  have been owned, directly or indirectly, for at least five years by the  distributing corporation. A separation is achieved through the  distribution by the distributing corporation of stock, or stock and  securities, of one or more subsidiaries (the ``controlled  corporations'') to its shareholders with respect to its stock or to its  security holders in exchange for its securities. The controlled  corporations may be preexisting or newly created subsidiaries.  Throughout the regulations under section 355, the term distribution  refers to a distribution by the distributing corporation of stock, or  stock and securities, of one or more controlled corporations, unless the  context indicates otherwise. Section 355 contemplates the continued  operation of the business or businesses existing prior to the  separation. See Sec. 1.355-4 for types of distributions that may  qualify under section 355, including pro rata distributions and non pro  rata distributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> applies to  distributions occurring on or after March 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nonqualified preferred stock. See Sec. 1.356-7(a) and (b) for  the treatment of nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in section  351(g)(2)) received in certain exchanges for (or in certain  distributions with respect to) nonqualified preferred stock or preferred  stock. See Sec. 1.356-7(c) for the treatment of the receipt of  preferred stock in certain exchanges for (or in certain distributions  with respect to) common or preferred stock described in section  351(g)(2)(C)(i)(II).
