                            <p class="depth0">Effective repairs are the key to achieving program goals and the  State shall take steps to ensure the capability exists in the repair  industry to repair vehicles that fail I/M tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Technical assistance. The oversight agency shall provide the  repair industry with information and assistance related to vehicle  inspection diagnosis and repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency shall regularly inform repair facilities of changes  in the inspection program, training course schedules, common problems  being found with particular engine families, diagnostic tips and the  like.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency shall provide a hot line service to assist repair  technicians with specific repair problems, answer technical questions  that arise in the repair process, and answer questions related to the  legal requirements of State and Federal law with regard to emission  control device tampering, engine switching, or similar issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance monitoring. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In enhanced I/M program areas, the  oversight agency shall monitor the performance of individual motor  vehicle repair facilities, and provide to the public at the time of  initial failure, a summary of the performance of local repair facilities  that have repaired vehicles for retest. Performance monitoring shall  include statistics on the number of vehicles submitted for a retest  after repair by the repair facility, the percentage passing on first  retest, the percentage requiring more than one repair/retest trip before  passing, and the percentage receiving a waiver. Programs may provide  motorists with alternative statistics that convey similar information on  the relative ability of repair facilities in providing effective and  convenient repair, in light of the age and other characteristics of  vehicles presented for repair at each facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Programs shall provide feedback, including statistical and  qualitative information to individual repair facilities on a regular  basis (at least annually) regarding their success in repairing failed  vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A prerequisite for a retest shall be a completed repair form  that indicates which repairs were performed, as well as any technician  recommended repairs that were not performed, and identification of the  facility that performed the repairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of  this section are not currently available, shall insure that training is  made available to all interested individuals in the community either  through private or public facilities.

The training  available shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Diagnosis and repair of malfunctions in computer controlled,  close-loop vehicles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of emission control theory and diagnostic data  to the diagnosis and repair of failures on the transient emission test  and the evaporative system functional checks (where applicable);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Utilization of diagnostic information on systematic or repeated  failures observed in the transient emission test and the evaporative  system functional checks (where applicable); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General training on the various subsystems related to engine  emission control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SIP requirements. The SIP shall include a description of the  technical assistance program to be implemented, a description of the  procedures and criteria to be used in meeting the performance monitoring  requirements of this section, and a description of the repair technician  training resources available in the community.
