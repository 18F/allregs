A proprietor who conducts wine operations shall maintain wine transaction records and submit reports as required by this part. Transaction records may be recorded in wine gallons or in liters. However, required reports will show wine volumes in wine gallons. The equivalent wine gallons of wine bottled or packed and labeled according to metric measure will be determined using the following conversion factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Per case. Equivalent gallonage may be determined using the following conversion factors for cases of metric bottles:

Equivalent gallonage may be determined by multiplying total liters by a conversion factor of 0.26417 gallons per liter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time of making entries. Any operation or transaction is to be entered in records or commercial papers at the time the operation or transaction occurs, except that where records are posted from source records or from supplemental auxiliary records prepared at the time the operation or transaction occurs, entries in another record may be deferred to not later than the close of business of the third business day succeeding the day on which the operation or transaction occurs. The proprietor shall retain all source records and all supplemental or auxiliary records which support entries in other records or commercial papers in order to facilitate verification of operations by appropriate TTB officers. Source records and supplemental or auxiliary records may be used as a record of an operation or transaction and to prepare the TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations, provided the record will readily

allow for verification of an operation or transaction by appropriate TTB officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prescribed forms.

All prescribed returns, reports and records (including source records) will be retained by the proprietor for a period of not less than three years from the record date or the date of the last entry required to be made in the record, whichever is later. However, the appropriate TTB officer may require records to be kept an additional period not exceeding three years in any case where retention is determined to be necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data processing.

Whenever records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be made for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as if it were the original record, and it will be treated and considered for all purposes as though it were the original record. All provisions of law and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the reproduced record. As used in this paragraph, ``original record'' means the record required to be maintained or preserved by the proprietor, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations.
