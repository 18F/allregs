                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engine cooling. Cool the engine during testing so its intake- air, oil, coolant, block, and head temperatures are within their  expected ranges for normal operation. You may use auxiliary coolers and  fans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For air-cooled engines only, if you use auxiliary fans you must  account for work input to the fan(s) according to Sec.  1065.110.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> See Sec.  1065.125 for more information related to intake-air  cooling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> See Sec.  1065.127 for more information related to exhaust gas  recirculation cooling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Measure temperatures at the manufacturer-specified locations. If  the manufacturer does not specify temperature measurement locations,  then use good engineering judgment to monitor intake-air, oil, coolant,  block, and head temperatures to ensure that they are in their expected  ranges for normal operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forced cooldown. You may install a forced cooldown system for an  engine and an exhaust aftertreatment device according to Sec.   1065.530(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lubricating oil. Use lubricating oils specified in Sec.   1065.740. For two-stroke engines that involve a specified mixture of  fuel and lubricating oil, mix the lubricating oil with the fuel  according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Coolant. For liquid-cooled engines, use coolant as specified in  Sec.  1065.745.  [70 FR 40516, July 13, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 37293, June 30, 2008]</p>
