                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Low-income requirement. Except in the case of a PHA's offer of  first refusal to a resident occupying the unit under Sec. 906.13, a  family purchasing a property under a PHA homeownership program must be a  low-income family, as defined in section 3 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C.  1437a), at the time the contract to purchase the property is executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Principal residence requirement. The dwelling unit sold to an  eligible family must be used as the principal residence of the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial capacity requirement. Eligibility must be limited to  families who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of  homeownership, under minimum income standards for affordability, taking  into account the unavailability of public housing operating subsidies  and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A  homeownership program may, however, take account of any available  subsidy from other sources. Under this affordability standard, an  applicant must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cost/income ratio. On an average monthly estimate, the amount of  the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus  insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, and other  regularly recurring homeownership costs (such as condominium,  cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed  the sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24  CFR part 913; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any subsidy that will be available for such payments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Down payment requirement. Each family purchasing housing under a  homeownership program must provide a down payment in connection with any  loan for acquisition of the housing, in an amount determined by the PHA  or PRE, in accordance with an approved homeownership program. Except as  provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the PHA or PRE must permit  the family to use grant amounts, gifts from relatives, contributions  from private sources, and other similar amounts in making the down  payment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The family must use its own resources other than grants, gifts,  contributions, or similar amounts, to contribute an amount of the down  payment that is not less than one percent of the purchase price of the  housing. The PHA or PRE must maintain records that are verifiable by HUD  through audits regarding the source of this one percent contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other requirements established by the PHA. A PHA may establish  requirements or limitations for families to purchase housing under a  homeownership program, including but not limited to requirements or  limitations regarding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employment or participation in employment counseling or training  activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Criminal activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participation in homeownership counseling programs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Evidence of regular income.</p>
