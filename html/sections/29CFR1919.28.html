Over 50 tons.............................  10 percent in excess. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The proof load shall be lifted and swung as far as possible in  both directions. If the jib or boom of the crane has a variable radius,  it shall be tested with proof loads, as specified in paragraph (a) of  this section, at the maximum and minimum radii. In the case of hydraulic  cranes, when due to the limitation of pressure it is impossible to lift  a load 25 percent in excess of the safe working load, it will be  sufficient to lift the greatest possible load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial proof tests of new cranes shall be made only with a dead  load as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Initial tests of cranes which have been in service, quadrennial  tests, or tests associated with replacements or renewals, may be made  with spring or hydraulic balances where dead loads are not reasonably  available under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tests shall be conducted at maximum, minimum, and intermediate  radius points, as well as such points in the arc of rotation as meet  with the approval of the accredited person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An additional test shall be conducted with partial load and  shall include all functions and movements contemplated in the use of the  crane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In cases where shore-type cranes are mounted permanently aboard  barges, the requirements of this Subpart E with respect to unit proof  tests and examinations shall not apply and the applicable requirements  of Subpart H of this part shall be adhered to with respect to unit proof  tests and examinations.</p>
