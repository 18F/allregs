                                Sec. 121.331  Supplemental oxygen requirements for pressurized cabin
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane pressurized cabin, each certificate holder shall equip the airplane to comply with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section in the event of cabin pressurization failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For crewmembers. When operating at flight altitudes above 10,000 feet, the certificate holder shall provide enough oxygen for each crewmember for the entire flight at those altitudes and not less than a two-hour supply for each flight crewmember on flight deck duty. The required two hours supply is that quantity of oxygen necessary for a constant rate of descent from the airplane's maximum certificated operating altitude to 10,000 feet in ten minutes and followed by 110 minutes at 10,000 feet. The oxygen required by Sec. 121.337 may be considered in determining the supplemental breathing supply required for flight crewmembers on flight deck duty in the event of cabin pressurization failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For passengers. When operating at flight altitudes above 8,000 feet, the certificate holder shall provide oxygen as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an airplane is not flown at a flight altitude above flight level 250, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers, if at any point along the route to be flown the airplane can safely descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less within four minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the airplane cannot descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less within four minutes, the following supply of oxygen must be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For that part of the flight that is more than four minutes duration at flight altitudes above 15,000 feet, the supply required by Sec. 121.327(c)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For that part of the flight at flight altitudes above 14,000 feet, up to and including 15,000 feet, the supply required by Sec. 121.327(c)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For flight at flight altitudes above 8,000 feet up to and including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an airplane is flown at a flight altitude above flight level 250, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers for the entire flight (including emergency descent) above 8,000 feet, up to and including 14,000 feet, and to comply with Sec. 121.327(c) (2) and (3) for flight above 14,000 feet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of this section it is assumed that the cabin pressurization failure occurs at a time during flight that is critical from the standpoint of oxygen need and that after the failure the airplane will descend, without exceeding its normal operating limitations, to flight altitudes allowing safe flight with respect to terrain clearance.
