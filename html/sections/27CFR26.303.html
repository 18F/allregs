                            <p class="depth0">The customs officer shall not release distilled spirits under this subpart until he inspects the spirits, and, if it appears that losses in transit were sustained from any container, he shall gauge the spirits in such container. If the spirits are in a bulk conveyance, the customs officer shall record the elements of his gauge on the transfer record, or, if the spirits are in packages, on the gauge record required by Sec. 26.302, and attach it to the transfer record. The customs officer shall also record on the transfer record the port of entry, carrier identification, and warehouse entry number. When the consignee has complied with all customs requirements, the customs officer shall release the spirits for transfer to the distilled spirits plant, by dating and signing the transfer record with his title the statement: ``To the best of my knowledge the information hereon is accurate and the spirits are released''. The customs officer shall retain a copy of the transfer record and any attachment, forward a copy of the transfer record and any attachments to the appropriate TTB officer, and give the original of the transfer record with any attachments to the consignee.
