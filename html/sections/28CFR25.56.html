                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By no later than March 31, 2009, and continuing on a monthly  basis as designated by the operator, any individual or entity engaged in  the business of operating a junk yard or salvage yard within the United  States shall provide, or cause to be provided on its behalf, to the  operator and in a format acceptable to the operator, an inventory of all  junk automobiles or salvage automobiles obtained in whole or in part by  that entity in the prior month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The inventory shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and contact information for the reporting  entity (junk, salvage yard, recycler);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> VIN;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date the automobile was obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name of the individual or entity from whom the automobile  was obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement of whether the automobile was crushed or disposed  of, for sale or other purposes, to whom it was provided or transferred,  and if the vehicle is intended for export out of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Junk and salvage yards, however, are not required to report this  information if they already report the information to the state and the  state makes the information required in this rule available to the  operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Junk and salvage yards may be required to file an update or  supplemental report of final disposition of any automobile where final  disposition information was not available at the time of the initial  report filing, or if their actual disposition of the automobile differs  from what was initially reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Junk and salvage yards are encouraged to provide the operator  with similar information on motor vehicles other than automobiles that  they obtain that possess VINs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Junk- and salvage-yard operators whose required data is provided  to the operator through an operator-authorized third party (e.g., state  or other public or private organization) in a manner acceptable to the  operator are not required to duplicate such reporting. In addition, junk  and salvage yards are not required to report on an automobile if they  are issued a verification under 49 U.S.C. 33110 stating that the  automobile or parts from the automobile are not reported as stolen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Such entities must report all salvage or junk vehicles they  obtain, including vehicles from or on behalf of insurance carriers,  which can be reasonably assumed are total loss vehicles. Such entities,  however, are not required to report any vehicle that is determined not  to meet the definition of salvage or junk after a good-faith physical  and value appraisal conducted by qualified appraisal personnel, so long  as such appraisals are conducted entirely independent of any other  interests, persons or entities. Individuals and entities that handle  less than five vehicles per year that are determined to be salvage,  junk, or total loss are not required to report under the salvage-yard  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Scrap metal processors and shredders that receive automobiles  for recycling where the condition of such vehicles generally prevent  VINs from being identified are not required to report to the operator if  the source of each vehicle has already reported the vehicle to NMVTIS.  In cases where a supplier's compliance with NMVTIS cannot be  ascertained, however, scrap metal processors and shredders must report  these   vehicles to the operator based on a visual inspection if possible. If  the VIN cannot be determined based on this inspection, scrap metal  processors and shredders may rely on primary documentation (i.e., title  documents) provided by the vehicle supplier.</p>
