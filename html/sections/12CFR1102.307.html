                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disclosure prohibited. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of  this section or by 12 CFR part 1102, subpart C, no person shall disclose  or permit the disclosure of any exempt records, or information contained  therein, to any   persons other than those officers, directors, employees, or agents of  the ASC or a State appraiser regulatory agency who has a need for such  records in the performance of their official duties. In any instance in  which any person has possession, custody or control of ASC exempt  records or information contained therein, all copies of such records  shall remain the property of the ASC and under no circumstances shall  any person, entity or agency disclose or make public in any manner the  exempt records or information without written authorization from the  Executive Director, after consultation with the ASC General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>  through (3) of this section. Authority to disclose or authorize  disclosure of exempt records of the ASC is delegated to the Executive  Director, after consultation with the ASC General Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure by Executive Director. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Executive Director, or  designee, may disclose or authorize the disclosure of any exempt record  in response to a valid judicial subpoena, court order, or other legal  process, and authorize any current or former member, officer, employee,  agent of the ASC, or third party, to appear and testify regarding an  exempt record or any information obtained in the performance of such  person's official duties, at any administrative or judicial hearing or  proceeding where such person has been served with a valid subpoena,  court order, or other legal process requiring him or her to testify. The  Executive Director shall consider the relevancy of such exempt records  or testimony to the ligation, and the interests of justice, in  determining whether to disclose such records or testimony. Third parties  seeking disclosure of exempt records or testimony in litigation to which  the ASC is not a party shall submit a request for discretionary  disclosure directly to the Executive Director. Such requests shall  specify the information sought with reasonable particularity and shall  be accompanied by a statement with supporting documentation showing in  detail the relevance of such exempt information to the litigation,  justifying good cause for disclosure, and a commitment to be bound by a  protective order. Failure to exhaust such administration request prior  to service of a subpoena or other legal process may, in the Executive  Director's discretion, serve as a basis for objection to such subpoena  or legal process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Executive Director, or designee, may in his or her  discretion and for good cause, disclose or authorize disclosure of any  exempt record or testimony by a current or former member, officer,  employee, agent of the ASC, or third party, sought in connection with  any civil or criminal hearing, proceeding or investigation without the  service of a judicial subpoena, or other legal process requiring such  disclosure or testimony. If he or she determines that the records or  testimony are relevant to the hearing, proceeding or investigation and  that disclosure is in the best interests of justice and not otherwise  prohibited by Federal statute. Where the Executive Director or designee  authorizes a current or former member, officer, director, empl9oyee or  agent of the ASC to testify or disclose exempt records pursuant to this  paragraph (b)(1), he or she may, in his or her discretion, limit the  authorization to so much of the record or testimony as is relevant to  the issues at such hearing, proceeding or investigation, and he or she  shall give authorization only upon fulfillment of such conditions as he  or she deems necessary and practicable to protect the confidential  nature of such records or testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorization for disclosure by the Chairman of the ASC. Except  where expressly prohibited by law, the Chairman of the ASC may, in his  or her discretion, authorize the disclosure of any   ASC records. Except where disclosure is required by law, the Chairman  may direct any current or former member, officer, director, employee or  agent of the ASC to refuse to disclose any record or to give testimony  if the Chairman determines, in his or her discretion, that refusal to  permit such disclosure is in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on disclosure. All steps practicable shall be taken  to protect the confidentiality of exempt records and information. Any  disclosure permitted by paragraph (b) of this section is discretionary  and nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall be construed as  requiring the disclosure of information. Further, nothing in paragrah  (b) of this section shall be construed as restricting, in any manner,  the authority of the ASC, the Chairman of the ASC, the Executive  Director, the ASC General Counsel, or their designees, in their  discretion and in light of the facts and circumstances attendant in any  given case, to require conditions upon, and to limit, the form, manner,  and extent of any disclosure permitted by this section. Wherever  practicable, disclosure of exempt records shall be made pursuant to a  protective order and redacted to exclude all irrelevant or non- responsive exempt information.
