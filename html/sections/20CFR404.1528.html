                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Symptoms are your own description of your physical or mental  impairment. Your statements alone are not enough to establish that there  is a physical or mental impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signs are anatomical, physiological, or psychological  abnormalities which can be observed, apart from your statements  (symptoms). Signs must be shown by medically acceptable clinical  diagnostic techniques. Psychiatric signs are medically demonstrable  phenomena that indicate specific psychological abnormalities, e.g.,  abnormalities of behavior, mood, thought, memory, orientation,  development, or perception. They must also be shown by observable facts  that can be medically described and evaluated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Laboratory findings are anatomical, physiological, or  psychological phenomena which can be shown by the use of medically  acceptable laboratory diagnostic techniques. Some of these diagnostic  techniques include chemical tests, electrophysiological studies  (electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, etc.), roentgenological  studies (X-rays), and psychological tests.
