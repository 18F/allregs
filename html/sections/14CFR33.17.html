                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The design and construction of the engine and the materials used must minimize the probability of the occurrence and spread of fire during normal operation and failure conditions, and must minimize the effect of such a fire. In addition, the design and construction of turbine engines must minimize the probability of the occurrence of an internal fire that could result in structural failure or other hazardous effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each external line, fitting, and other component, which contains or conveys flammable fluid during normal engine operation, must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Administrator. Components must be shielded or located to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A tank, which contains flammable fluids and any associated shut-off means and supports, which are part of and attached to the engine, must be fireproof either by construction or by protection unless damage by fire will not cause leakage or spillage of a hazardous quantity of flammable fluid. For a reciprocating engine having an integral oil sump of less than 23.7 liters capacity, the oil sump need not be fireproof or enclosed by a fireproof shield.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An engine component designed, constructed, and installed to act as a firewall must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fireproof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Constructed so that no hazardous quantity of air, fluid or flame can pass around or through the firewall; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protected against corrosion;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, engine control system components that are located in a designated fire zone must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unintentional accumulation of hazardous quantities of flammable fluid within the engine must be prevented by draining and venting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any components, modules, or equipment, which are susceptible to or are potential sources of static discharges or electrical fault currents must be designed and constructed to be properly grounded to the engine reference, to minimize the risk of ignition in external areas where flammable fluids or vapors could be present.
