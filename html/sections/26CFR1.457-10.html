                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan terminations and frozen plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An eligible  employer may amend its plan to eliminate future deferrals for existing  participants or to limit participation to existing participants and  employees. An eligible plan may also contain provisions that permit plan  termination and permit amounts deferred to be distributed on  termination. In order for a plan to be considered terminated, amounts  deferred under an eligible plan must be distributed to all plan  participants and beneficiaries as soon as administratively practicable  after termination of the eligible plan. The mere provision for, and  making of, distributions to participants or beneficiaries upon a plan  termination will not cause an eligible plan to cease to satisfy the  requirements of section 457(b) or the regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employers that cease to be eligible employers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plan not  terminated. An eligible employer that ceases to be an eligible employer  may no longer maintain an eligible plan. If the employer was a tax- exempt entity and the plan is not terminated as permitted under  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the tax consequences to  participants and beneficiaries in the previously eligible (unfunded)  plan of an ineligible employer are determined in accordance with either  section 451 if the employer becomes an entity other than a State or  Sec. 1.457-11 if the employer becomes a State. If the employer was a  State and the plan is neither terminated as permitted under paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section nor transferred to another eligible plan of  that State as permitted under paragraph (b) of this section, the tax  consequences to participants in the previously eligible governmental  plan of an ineligible employer, the assets of which are held in trust  pursuant to Sec. 1.457-8(a), are determined in accordance with section  402(b) (section 403(c) in the case of an annuity contract) and the trust  is no longer to be treated as a trust that is exempt from tax under  section 501(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan termination. As an alternative to determining the tax  consequences to the plan and participants under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section, the employer may terminate the plan and distribute the  amounts deferred (and all plan assets) to all plan participants as soon  as administratively practicable in accordance with   paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such distribution may include eligible  rollover distributions in the case of a plan that was an eligible  governmental plan. In addition, if the employer is a State, another  alternative to determining the tax consequences under paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section is to transfer the assets of the eligible  governmental plan to an eligible governmental plan of another eligible  employer within the same State under the plan-to-plan transfer rules of  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Y, a corporation that owns a State  hospital, sponsors an eligible governmental plan funded through a trust.  Employer Y is acquired by a for-profit hospital and Employer Y ceases to  be an eligible employer under section 457(e)(1) or Sec. 1.457-2(e).  Employer Y terminates the plan and, during the next 6 months,  distributes to participants and beneficiaries all amounts deferred that  were under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The termination and distribution does not cause the  plan to fail to be an eligible governmental plan. Amounts that are  distributed as eligible rollover distributions may be rolled over to an  eligible retirement plan described in section 402(c)(8)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  that Employer Y decides to continue to maintain the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. If Employer Y continues to maintain the plan, the  tax consequences to participants and beneficiaries will be determined in  accordance with either section 402(b) if the compensation deferred is  funded through a trust, section 403(c) if the compensation deferred is  funded through annuity contracts, or Sec. 1.457-11 if the compensation  deferred is not funded through a trust or annuity contract. In addition,  if Employer Y continues to maintain the plan, the trust will no longer  be treated as exempt from tax under section 501(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Z, a corporation that owns a tax- exempt hospital, sponsors an unfunded eligible plan. Employer Z is  acquired by a for-profit hospital and is no longer an eligible employer  under section 457(e)(1) or Sec. 1.457-2(e). Employer Z terminates the  plan and distributes all amounts deferred under the eligible plan to  participants and beneficiaries within a one-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Distributions under the plan are treated as made  under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity and the distributions of  the amounts deferred are includible in the gross income of the  participant or beneficiary in the year distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except  that Employer Z decides to maintain instead of terminate the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. If Employer Z maintains the plan, the tax  consequences to participants and beneficiaries in the plan will  thereafter be determined in accordance with section 451.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, and an eligible plan of a tax-exempt  entity may accept transfers from another eligible plan of a tax-exempt  entity as described in the preceding sentence. However, a State may not  transfer the assets of its eligible governmental plan to a tax-exempt  entity's eligible plan and the plan of a tax-exempt entity may not  accept such a transfer. Similarly, a tax-exempt entity may not transfer  the assets of its eligible plan to an eligible governmental plan and an  eligible governmental plan may not accept such a transfer. In addition,  if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to  permissive past service credit and repayments under section 415) are  met, an eligible governmental plan of a State may provide for the  transfer of amounts deferred by a participant or beneficiary to a  qualified plan (under section 401(a)) maintained by a State. However, a  qualified plan may not transfer assets to an eligible governmental plan  or to an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity, and an eligible  governmental plan or the plan of a tax-exempt entity may not accept such  a transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for post-severance plan-to-plan transfers among  eligible governmental plans. A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible  governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor plan provides for transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are  being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the  transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that  participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transfer for a participant, the participant  has had a severance from employment with the transferring employer and  is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirements for plan-to-plan transfers of all plan assets of  eligible governmental plan. A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible  governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer is from an eligible governmental plan to another  eligible governmental plan within the same State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All of the assets held by the transferor plan are transferred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transferor plan provides for transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being  transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer  at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant  or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The participants or beneficiaries whose deferred amounts are  being transferred are not eligible for additional annual deferrals in  the receiving plan unless they are performing services for the entity  maintaining the receiving plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirements for plan-to-plan transfers among eligible  governmental plans of the same employer. A transfer under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section from an eligible governmental plan to another  eligible governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are  met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer is from an eligible governmental plan to another  eligible governmental plan of the same employer (and, for this purpose,  the employer is not treated as the same employer if the participant's  compensation is paid by a different entity);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor plan provides for transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being  transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer  at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant  or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The participant or beneficiary whose deferred amounts are being  transferred is not eligible for additional annual deferrals in the  receiving plan unless the participant or beneficiary is performing  services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirements for post-severance plan-to-plan transfers among  eligible plans of tax-exempt entities. A transfer under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section from an eligible plan of a tax-exempt employer to  another eligible plan of a tax-exempt employer is permitted if the  following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor plan provides for transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are  being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the  transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that  participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transfer for a participant, the participant  has had a severance from employment with the transferring employer and  is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Treatment of amount transferred following a plan-to-plan  transfer between eligible plans. Following a transfer of any amount  between eligible plans under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this  section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferred amount is subject to the restrictions of  Sec. 1.457-6 (relating to when distributions are permitted to be made to  a participant under an eligible plan) in the receiving plan in the same  manner as if the transferred amount had been originally been deferred  under the receiving plan if the participant is performing services for  the entity maintaining the receiving plan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a transfer between eligible plans of tax-exempt  entities, except as otherwise determined by the Commissioner, the  transferred amount is subject to Sec. 1.457-7(c)(2) (relating to when  amounts are considered to be made available under an eligible plan of a  tax-exempt entity) in the same manner as if the elections made by the  participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan had been made under  the receiving plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of  this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Participant A, the president of City X's  hospital, has accepted a position with another hospital which is a tax- exempt entity. A participates in the eligible governmental plan of City  X. A would like to transfer the amounts deferred under City X's eligible  governmental plan to the eligible plan of the tax-exempt hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. City X's plan may not transfer A's amounts deferred  to the tax-exempt employer's eligible plan. In addition, because the  amounts deferred would no longer be held in trust for the exclusive  benefit of participants and their beneficiaries, the transfer would  violate the exclusive benefit rule of section 457(g) and Sec. 1.457- 8(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. County M, located in State S, operates several  health clinics and maintains an eligible governmental plan for employees  of those clinics. One of the clinics operated by County M is being  acquired by a hospital operated by State S, and employees of that clinic  will become employees of State S. County M permits those employees to  transfer their balances under County M's eligible governmental plan to  the eligible governmental plan of State S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. If the eligible governmental plans of County M and  State S provide for the transfer and acceptance of the transfer (and the  other requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied),  then the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section are satisfied  and, thus, the transfer will not cause either plan to violate the  requirements of section 457 or these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. City Employer Z, a hospital, sponsors an  eligible governmental plan. City Employer Z is located in State B. All  of the assets of City Employer Z are being acquired by a tax-exempt  hospital. City Employer Z, in accordance with the plan-to-plan transfer  rules of paragraph (b) of this section, would like to transfer the total  amount of assets deferred under City Employer Z's eligible governmental  plan to the acquiring tax-exempt entity's eligible plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. City Employer Z may not permit participants to  transfer the amounts to the eligible plan of the tax-exempt entity. In  addition, because the amounts deferred would no longer be held in trust  for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries, the  transfer would violate the exclusive benefit rule of section 457(g) and  Sec. 1.457-8(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except  that City Employer Z, instead of transferring all of its assets to the  eligible plan of the tax-exempt entity, decides to transfer all of the  amounts deferred under City Z's eligible governmental plan to the  eligible governmental plan of County B in which City Z is located.  County B's eligible plan does not cover employees of City Z, but is  willing to allow the assets of City Z's plan to be transferred to County  B's plan, a related state government entity, also located in State B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. If City Employer Z's (transferor) eligible  governmental plan provides for such transfer and the eligible  governmental plan of County B permits the acceptance of such a transfer  (and the other requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are  satisfied), then the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section  are satisfied and, thus, City Employer Z may transfer the total amounts  deferred under its eligible governmental plan, prior to termination of  that plan, to the eligible governmental plan maintained by County B.  However, the participants of City Employer Z whose deferred amounts are  being transferred are not eligible to participate in the eligible  governmental plan of County B, the receiving plan, unless they are  performing services for County B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. State C has an eligible governmental plan.  Employees of City U in State C are among the eligible employees for  State C's plan and City U decides to adopt another eligible governmental  plan only for its employees. State C decides to allow employees to elect  to transfer all of the   amounts deferred for an employee under State C's eligible governmental  plan to City U's eligible governmental plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. If State C's (transferor) eligible governmental  plan provides for such transfer and the eligible governmental plan of  City U permits the acceptance of such a transfer (and the other  requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied), then  the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are satisfied and,  thus, State C may transfer the total amounts deferred under its eligible  governmental plan to the eligible governmental plan maintained by City  U.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Purchase of permissive service credit by plan-to-plan transfers  from an eligible governmental plan to a qualified plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. An eligible governmental plan of a State may provide for the  transfer of amounts deferred by a participant or beneficiary to a  defined benefit governmental plan (as defined in section 414(d)), and no  amount shall be includible in gross income by reason of the transfer, if  the conditions in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section are met. A  transfer under this paragraph (b)(8) is not treated as a distribution  for purposes of Sec. 1.457-6. Therefore, such a transfer may be made  before severance from employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions for plan-to-plan transfers from an eligible  governmental plan to a qualified plan. A transfer may be made under this  paragraph (b)(8) only if the transfer is either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A))</em> under the receiving defined benefit governmental  plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A repayment to which section 415 does not apply by reason of  section 415(k)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(8) are  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan X is an eligible governmental plan  maintained by County Y for its employees. Plan X provides for  distributions only in the event of death, an unforeseeable emergency, or  severance from employment with County Y (including retirement from  County Y). Plan S is a qualified defined benefit plan maintained by  State T for its employees. County Y is within State T. Employee A is an  employee of County Y and is a participant in Plan X. Employee A  previously was an employee of State T and is still entitled to benefits  under Plan S. Plan S includes provisions allowing participants in  certain plans, including Plan X, to transfer assets to Plan S for the  purchase of service credit under Plan S and does not permit the amount  transferred to exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit resulting  from the service credit. Although not required to do so, Plan X allows  Employee A to transfer assets to Plan S to provide a service benefit  under Plan S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The transfer is permitted under this paragraph  (b)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified domestic relations orders under eligible plans--(1)  General rule. An eligible plan does not become an ineligible plan  described in section 457(f) solely because its administrator or sponsor  complies with a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section  414(p), including an order requiring the distribution of the benefits of  a participant to an alternate payee in advance of the general rules for  eligible plan distributions under Sec. 1.457-6. If a distribution or  payment is made from an eligible plan to an alternate payee pursuant to  a qualified domestic relations order, rules similar to the rules of  section 402(e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> shall apply to the distribution or payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Participant C and C's spouse D are divorcing.  C is employed by State S and is a participant in an eligible plan  maintained by State S. C has an account valued at $100,000 under the  plan. Pursuant to the divorce, a court issues a qualified domestic  relations order on September 1, 2003 that allocates 50 percent of C's  $100,000 plan account to D and specifically provides for an immediate  distribution to D of D's share within 6 months of the order. Payment is  made to D in January of 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. State S's eligible plan does not become an  ineligible plan described in section 457(f) and Sec. 1.457-11 solely  because its administrator or sponsor complies with the qualified  domestic relations order requiring the immediate distribution to D in  advance of the general rules for eligible plan distributions under  Sec. 1.457-6. In accordance with section 402(e)(1)(A), D (not C) must  include the distribution in gross income. The distribution is includible  in D's gross income in 2004. If the qualified domestic relations order  were to provide for distribution to D at a future date, amounts deferred  attributable to D's share will be includible in D's gross income when  paid to D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  that S is a tax-exempt entity, instead of a State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. State S's eligible plan does not become an  ineligible plan described in section 457(f) and Sec. 1.457-11 solely  because its administrator or sponsor complies with the qualified  domestic relations order requiring the immediate distribution to D in  advance of the general rules for eligible plan distributions under  Sec. 1.457-6. In accordance with section 402(e)(1)(A), D (not C) must  include the distribution in gross income. The distribution is includible  in D's gross income in 2004, assuming that the plan did not make the  distribution available to D in 2003. If the qualified domestic relations  order were to provide for distribution to D at a future date, amounts  deferred attributable to D's share would be includible in D's gross  income when paid or made available to D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Death benefits and life insurance proceeds. A death benefit plan  under section 457(e)(11) is not an eligible plan. In addition, no amount  paid or made available under an eligible plan as death benefits or life  insurance proceeds is excludable from gross income under section 101.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rollovers to eligible governmental plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An  eligible governmental plan may accept contributions that are eligible  rollover distributions (as defined in section 402(c)(4)) made from  another eligible retirement plan (as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B)) if  the conditions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section are met. Amounts  contributed to an eligible governmental plan as eligible rollover  distributions are not taken into account for purposes of the annual  limit on annual deferrals by a participant in Sec. 1.457-4(c) or  Sec. 1.457-5, but are otherwise treated in the same manner as amounts  deferred under section 457 for purposes of Secs. 1.457-3 through 1.457-9  and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> to provide  that it will separately account for any eligible rollover distributions  it receives. A plan does not fail to satisfy this requirement if it  separately accounts for particular types of eligible rollover  distributions (for example, if it maintains a separate account for  eligible rollover distributions attributable to annual deferrals that  were made under other eligible governmental plans and a separate account  for amounts attributable to other eligible rollover distributions), but  this requirement is not satisfied if any such separate account includes  any amount that is not attributable to an eligible rollover  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan T is an eligible governmental plan that  provides that employees who are eligible to participate in Plan T may  make rollover contributions to Plan T from amounts distributed to an  employee from an eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan  is defined in Plan T as another eligible governmental plan, a qualified  section 401(a) or 403(a) plan, or a section 403(b) contract, or an  individual retirement arrangement (IRA) that holds such amounts. Plan T  requires rollover contributions to be paid by the eligible retirement  plan directly to Plan T (a direct rollover) or to be paid by the  participant within 60 days after the date on which the participant  received the amount from the other eligible retirement plan. Plan T does  not take rollover contributions into account for purposes of the plan's  limits on amounts deferred that conform to Sec. 1.457-4(c). Rollover  contributions paid to Plan T are invested in the trust in the same  manner as amounts deferred under Plan T and rollover contributions (and  earnings thereon) are available for distribution to the participant at  the same time and in the same manner as amounts deferred under Plan T.  In addition, Plan T provides that, for each participant who makes a  rollover contribution to Plan T, the Plan T record-keeper is to  establish a separate account for the participant's rollover  contributions. The record-keeper calculates earnings and losses for  investments held in the rollover account separately from earnings and  losses on other amounts held under the plan and calculates disbursements  from and payments made to the rollover account separately from  disbursements from and payments made to other amounts held under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Plan T does not lose its status as an eligible  governmental plan as a result of the receipt of rollover contributions.  The conclusion would not be different if the Plan T record-keeper were  to establish two separate accounts, one of which is for the  participant's rollover contributions attributable to annual deferrals  that were made under an eligible governmental plan and the other of  which is for other rollover contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Deemed IRAs under eligible governmental plans. See regulations  under section 408(q) for guidance regarding the treatment of separate  accounts or annuities as individual retirement plans (IRAs).
