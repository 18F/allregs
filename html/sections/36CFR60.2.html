                            <p class="depth0">The National Register is an authoritative guide to be used by  Federal, State, and local governments, private groups and citizens to  identify the Nation's cultural resources and to indicate what properties  should be considered for protection from destruction or impairment.  Listing of private property on the National Register does not prohibit  under Federal law or regulation any actions which may otherwise   be taken by the property owner with respect to the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The National Register was designed to be and is administered as  a planning tool. Federal agencies undertaking a project having an effect  on a listed or eligible property must provide the Advisory Council on  Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment pursuant to  section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as  amended. The Council has adopted procedures concerning, inter alia,  their commenting responsibility in 36 CFR part 800. Having complied with  this procedural requirement the Federal agency may adopt any course of  action it believes is appropriate. While the Advisory Council comments  must be taken into account and integrated into the decisionmaking  process, program decisions rest with the agency implementing the  undertaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Listing in the National Register also makes property owners  eligible to be considered for Federal grants-in-aid for historic  preservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a property is listed in the National Register, certain  provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 as amended by the Revenue Act  of 1978 and the Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980 may apply. These  provisions encourage the preservation of depreciable historic structures  by allowing favorable tax treatments for rehabilitation, and discourage  destruction of historic buildings by eliminating certain otherwise  available Federal tax provisions both for demolition of historic  structures and for new construction on the site of demolished historic  buildings. Owners of historic buildings may benefit from the investment  tax credit provisions of the Revenue Act of 1978. The Economic Recovery  Tax Act of 1981 generally replaces the rehabilitation tax incentives  under these laws beginning January 1, 1982 with a 25% investment tax  credit for rehabilitations of historic commercial, industrial and  residential buildings. This can be combined with a 15-year cost recovery  period for the adjusted basis of the historic building. Historic  buildings with certified rehabilitations receive additional tax savings  by their exemption from any requirement to reduce the basis of the  building by the amount of the credit. The denial of accelerated  depreciation for a building built on the site of a demolished historic  building is repealed effective January 1, 1982. The Tax Treatment  Extension Act of 1980 includes provisions regarding charitable  contributions for conservation purposes of partial interests in  historically important land areas or structures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a property contains surface coal resources and is listed in  the National Register, certain provisions of the Surface Mining and  Control Act of 1977 require consideration of a property's historic  values in the determination on issuance of a surface coal mining permit.</p>
