                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Protection against loss account. Section 826(d) provides that for purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from the protection against loss account under section 824(d)(1)(D) and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts added to the account for the fifth preceding taxable year) for any taxable year, any amount which was added to such account by reason of the election under section 826(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.826-1 shall be treated as having been added by reason of section 824(a)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts equal to 1 percent of losses incurred during the taxable year). Thus, no amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election made under section 826(a) may remain in such account beyond the end of the fifth taxable year following the taxable year with respect to which such amount was added. See section 824(d)(1)(D) and paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.824-1. The amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) is that amount which is equal to 25 percent (plus, in the case of a reciprocal which qualifies as a concentrated risk company under section 824(a), so much of the concentrated wind-storm, etc., premium percentage as exceeds 40 percent) of the amount by which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The underwriting gain (as defined by section 824(a)(1)) computed after taking into account the limitation provided by section 826(b) and Sec. 1.826-1, exceeds</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The underwriting gain computed without regard to the limitation provided by section 826(b) and Sec. 1.826-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Denial of surtax exemption. Section 826(f) provides that the tax imposed upon any increase in the mutual insurance company taxable income of a reciprocal which is attributable to the limitation provided by section 826(b) shall be computed without regard to the surtax exemption provided by section 821(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, a company making the election provided under section 826(a) will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, on the increase in its mutual insurance company taxable income for the taxable year which is attributable to such election. Similarly, any amount which was added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) and Sec. 1.826-1, and which is subtracted from such account in accordance with section 826(d) and paragraph (a) of this section, will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, to the extent such amount increases mutual insurance company taxable income in the year in which the subtraction is made. Furthermore, the company will be subject to surtax on such increases notwithstanding the fact that it may have no normal tax liability for the taxable year, because its mutual insurance company taxable income (after giving effect to the election provided by section 826(a)) does not exceed $6,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment for refunds. Section 826(g) provides that if for any taxable year an attorney-in-fact is allowed a credit or refund for taxes paid with respect to which credit or refund to the reciprocal resulted under section 826(e), the taxes of such reciprocal for such taxable year shall be properly adjusted. The reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by increasing its income tax liability for its taxable year in which the credit or refund is allowed to the attorney-in-fact by the amount of such credit or refund which is attributable to taxes paid by the attorney-in-fact on income received from the reciprocal, as determined under Sec. 1.826-6, but only to the extent that the payment of such amount by the attorney-in-fact resulted in a credit or refund to the reciprocal. However, if the refund or credit to the attorney-in-fact is the result of an error in determining its items of income or deduction for the taxable year with respect to which the refund or credit is allowed, and such error affects the amount of deductions allocable to its reciprocal for such taxable year, then, if the reciprocal's period for filing an amended return has not otherwise expired, the preceding sentence shall not apply and the reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by filing an amended return for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years for which an adjustment is required. The reciprocal's amended return or returns shall give effect to the change in the deductions of the attorney-in-fact allocable to income received from the reciprocal and the tax paid by the attorney-in-fact attributable to such income. The amount of any adjustment required by section 826(g) and this section and the computation thereof shall be set forth in a statement attached to and filed with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which the adjustment is made. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, and a copy of the notification received by the attorney-in-fact indicating that it has been allowed the credit or refund requiring adjustment of the reciprocal's taxes.
