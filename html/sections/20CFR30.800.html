Whether years of wage-loss are compensable depends on determinations with respect to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The average annual wage of the employee as determined by OWCP in accordance with Sec. 30.810;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The percentage of his or her average annual wage that the employee was able to earn during the calendar year(s) in question as determined by OWCP in accordance with Sec. 30.811; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether the employee's inability to earn at least as much as his or her average annual wage was due to a covered illness as defined in Sec. 30.5(r).</p>
