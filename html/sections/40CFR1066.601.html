                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes calculations used to determine emission rates. See the standard-setting part and the other provisions of this part to determine which equations apply for your testing. This subpart describes how to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use the signals recorded before, during, and after an emission test to calculate distance-specific emissions of each regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Perform calculations for calibrations and performance checks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine statistical values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may use data from multiple systems to calculate test results for a single emission test, consistent with good engineering judgment. You may also make multiple measurements from a single batch sample, such as multiple weighing of a PM filter or multiple readings from a bag sample. Although you may use an average of multiple measurements from a single test, you may not use test results from multiple emission tests to report emissions. We allow weighted means where appropriate, such as for sampling onto a PM filter over the FTP. You may discard statistical outliers, but you must report all results.</p>
