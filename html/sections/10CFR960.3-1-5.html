                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evaluations of individual sites and comparisons between and  among sites shall be based on the postclosure and preclosure guidelines  specified in subparts C and D of this part, respectively. Except for  screening for potentially acceptable sites as specified in Sec. 960.3-2- 1, such evaluations shall place primary significance on the postclosure  guidelines and secondary significance on the preclosure guidelines, with  each set of guidelines considered collectively for such purposes. Both  the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines consist of a system  guideline or guidelines and corresponding groups of technical  guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The postclosure guidelines of subpart C of this part contain  eight technical guidelines in one group. The preclosure guidelines of  subpart D of this part contain eleven technical guidelines separated  into three groups that represent, in decreasing order of importance,  preclosure radiological safety; environment, socioeconomics, and  transportation; and ease and cost of siting, construction, operation,  and closure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The relative significance of any technical guideline to its  corresponding system guideline is site specific. Therefore, for each  technical guideline, an evaluation of compliance with the qualifying  condition shall be made in the context of the collection of system  elements and the evidence related to that guideline, considering on  balance the favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions  identified at a site. Similarly, for each system guideline, such  evaluation shall be made in the context of the group of technical  guidelines and the evidence related to that system guideline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of recommending sites for development as  repositories, such evidence shall include analyses of expected  repository performance to assess the likelihood of demonstrating  compliance with 40 CFR part 191 and 10 CFR part 60, in accordance with  Sec. 960.4-1. A site shall be disqualified at any time during the siting  process if the evidence supports a finding by the DOE that a  disqualifying condition exists or the qualifying condition of any system  or technical guideline cannot be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Comparisons between and among sites shall be based on the system  guidelines, to the extent practicable and in accordance with the levels  of relative significance specified above for the postclosure and the  preclosure guidelines. Such comparisons are intended to allow  comparative evaluations of sites in terms of the capabilities of the  natural barriers for waste isolation and to identify innate deficiencies  that could jeopardize compliance with such requirements. If the evidence  for the sites is not adequate to substantiate such comparisons, then the  comparisons shall be based on the groups of technical guidelines under  the postclosure and the preclosure guidelines, considering the levels of  relative significance appropriate to the postclosure and the preclosure  guidelines and the order of importance appropriate to the subordinate  groups within the preclosure guidelines. Comparative site evaluations  shall place primary importance on the natural barriers of the site. In  such evaluations for the postclosure guidelines of subpart C of this  part, engineered barriers shall be considered only to the extent  necessary to obtain realistic source terms for comparative site  evaluations based on the sensitivity of the natural barriers to such  realistic engineered barriers. For a better understanding of the  potential effects of engineered barriers on the overall performance of  the repository system, these comparative evaluations shall consider a  range of   levels in the performance of the engineered barriers. That range of  performance levels shall vary by at least a factor of 10 above and below  the engineered-barrier performance requirements set forth in 10 CFR  60.113, and the range considered shall be identical for all sites  compared. The comparisons shall assume equivalent engineered barrier  performance for all sites compared and shall be structured so that  engineered barriers are not relied upon to compensate for deficiencies  in the geologic media. Furthermore, engineered barriers shall not be  used to compensate for an inadequate site; mask the innate deficiencies  of a site; disguise the strengths and weaknesses of a site and the  overall system; and mask differences between sites when they are  compared. Releases of different radionuclides shall be combined by the  methods specified in appendix A of 40 CFR part 191.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The comparisons specified in paragraph (e) of this section shall  consist of two comparative evaluations that predict radionuclide  releases for 100,000 years after repository closure and shall be  conducted as follows. First, the sites shall be compared by means of  evaluations that emphasize the performance of the natural barriers at  the site. Second, the sites shall be compared by means of evaluations  that emphasize the performance of the total repository system. These  second evaluations shall consider the expected performance of the  repository system; be based on the expected performance of waste  packages and waste forms, in compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR  60.113, and on the expected hydrological and geochemical conditions at  each site; and take credit for the expected performance of all other  engineered components of the repository system. The comparison of  isolation capability shall be one of the significant considerations in  the recommendation of sites for the development of repositories. The  first of the two comparative evaluations specified in the paragraph (e)  of this section shall take precedence unless the second comparative  evaluation would lead to substantially different recommendations. In the  latter case, the two comparative evaluations shall receive comparable  consideration. Sites with predicted isolation capabilities that differ  by less than a factor of 10, with similar uncertainties, may be assumed  to provide equivalent isolation.  [66 FR 57334, Nov. 14, 2001]</p>
