                                Sec. 41.4483-6  Reduction in tax for trucks used in logging.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The tax imposed by section 4481 shall be reduced by  25 percent in the case of a truck used in logging.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Truck used in logging. The term ``truck used in logging'' means  any highway motor vehicle which--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is used exclusively during the taxable period for the  transportation, to and from a point located on a forested site, of  products harvested from such forested site, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is registered (under the laws of the State or States in which  such vehicle is required to be registered) as a highway motor vehicle  used exclusively in the transportation of harvested forest products.  Products harvested from the forested site may include timber which has  been processed for commercial use by sawing into lumber, chipping or  other milling operations if such processing occurs prior to  transportation from the forested site. A vehicle will be considered to  be registered under the laws of a state as a highway motor vehicle used  exclusively in the transportation of harvested forest products if such  vehicle is so registered under a state statute or legally valid  regulations. In addition, no special tag or license plate identifying a  vehicle as being used in the transportation of harvested forest products  is required.  [T.D. 8027, 50 FR 21250, May 23, 1985]</p>
