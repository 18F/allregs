                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to participants in the HPSP or  the VIOMPSP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any obligation of a participant for service or payment will be  cancelled upon the death of the participant.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7634(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waivers or suspensions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A participant may seek a waiver or  suspension of the obligated service or payment obligation incurred under  this program by submitting a written request to VA setting forth the  basis, circumstances, and causes which support the requested action.  Requests for waivers or suspensions must be submitted to VA no later  than 1 year after the date VA notifies the participant that he or she is  in breach of his or her acceptance agreement. A participant seeking a  waiver or suspension must comply with requests for additional  information from VA no later than 30 days after the date of any such  request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Waivers. A waiver is a permanent release by VA of the obligation  either to repay any scholarship funds that have already been paid to or  on behalf of the participant, or to fulfill any other acceptance  agreement requirement. If a waiver is granted, then the waived amount of  scholarship funds may be considered taxable income.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Suspensions. VA may approve an initial request for a suspension  for a period of up to 1 year. A suspension may be extended for one  additional year, after which time the participant will be in breach of  his or her acceptance agreement. If a suspension is approved:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> VA will temporarily discontinue providing any scholarship funds  to or on behalf of the participant while the participant's scholarship  is in a suspended status; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> VA will temporarily delay the enforcement of acceptance  agreement requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary may waive or suspend any service or payment  obligation incurred by a participant whenever compliance by the  participant (i) is impossible, due to circumstances beyond the control  of the participant or (ii) whenever the Secretary concludes that a  waiver or suspension of compliance would be in the best interest of the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7634(b))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance by a participant with a service or payment obligation  will be considered impossible due to circumstances beyond the control of  the participant if the Secretary determines, on the basis of such  information and documentation as may be required, that the participant  suffers from a physical or mental disability resulting in permanent  inability to perform the service or other activities which would be  necessary to comply with the obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waivers or suspensions of service or payment obligations, when  not related to paragraph (c) of this section, and when considered in the  best interest of the Department of Veterans Affairs, will be determined  by the Secretary on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligibility to reapply for award. Any previous participant of  any federally sponsored scholarship program who breached his or her  acceptance agreement or similar agreement in such scholarship program is  not eligible to apply for a HPSP or VIOMPSP. This includes participants  who previously applied for, and received, a waiver under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Finality of decisions. Decisions to approve or disapprove waiver  requests are final and binding determinations. Such determinations are  not subject to reconsideration or appeal.
