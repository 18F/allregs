                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory authority to adopt expedited closing procedure. The  Government in the Sunshine Act provides, at 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4), that  qualified agencies may establish by regulation expedited procedures for  announcing and closing certain meetings. Specifically, ``[a]ny agency, a  majority of whose meetings may properly be closed to the public pursuant  to paragraph (4), (8), (9)(A), or (10) of subsection (c) [of the  statute], or any combination thereof, may provide by regulation for the  closing of such meetings or portions thereof [through the expedited  closing procedure].'' See Sec. 2203.3(b)(4), (8), (9)(i) and (10), which  are equivalent to the referenced paragraphs of the statute. The  Commission had determined, for the reasons stated in paragraph (b) of  this section, that it is qualified to adopt implementing regulations  under 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4). It hereby announces that it will follow the  expedited closing procedure authorized under that statutory provision in  conducting its regularly-scheduled meetings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(10)</em>.  The Commission is an adjudicatory agency that has no regulatory  functions. It was established to   resolve disputes arising out of enforcement actions brought by the  Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,  29 U.S.C. 651-678. See 29 U.S.C. 659(c). The Commission's experience  under the Government in the Sunshine Act has been that almost all of its  meetings have been closed, in whole or in part, under 5 U.S.C.  552b(c)(10) because they involved only formal agency adjudication of  specific cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Announcements. Regularly-scheduled meetings of the Commission  will be held at 10:30 a.m. every Thursday, except for legal holidays, in  the Hearing Room (Suite 965) of the Commission's national office at One  Lafayette Centre, 1120-20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036-3457. If a  regularly-scheduled meeting is scheduled, public announcement of the  time, date and place of the meeting will be made at the earliest  practicable time by posting a notice in a prominent place at the  Commission's national office. If a regularly-scheduled meeting is  cancelled, a notice of cancellation will be posted in the same manner.  Information about the subject of each regularly-scheduled meeting will  be made available in the Office of the General Counsel, telephone number  (202) 606-5410, at the earliest practicable time. However, no  information that may be withheld under Sec. 2203.3(b) will be made  available, and individual items may be added to or deleted from the  agenda at any time. Inquiries from the public regarding any regularly- scheduled meeting will be directed to the Office of the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voting. At the beginning of each regularly-scheduled meeting,  the Commission will vote on whether to close the meeting. No proxy vote  will be permitted and the vote of each Commissioner will be recorded.  This record of each Commissioner's vote will be made available to the  public at the Commission's national office immediately after the  meeting.
