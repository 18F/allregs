                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except where specifically stated otherwise within this subpart,  the provisions of subparts A and B and of Secs. 15.201 through 15.204  and 15.207 of subpart C of this part apply to unlicensed UWB intentional  radiators. The provisions of Sec. 15.35(c) and 15.205 do not apply to  devices operated under this subpart. The provisions of Footnote US 246  to the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in Sec. 2.106 of this  chapter does not apply to devices operated under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio  transmitter, i.e., the intentional radiator, contained in the UWB  device. Other aspects of the operation of a UWB device may be subject to  requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a UWB  device that contains digital circuitry not directly associated with the  operation of the transmitter also is subject to the requirements for  unintentional radiators in subpart B of this part. Similarly, an  associated receiver that operates (tunes) within the frequency range 30  MHz to 960 MHz is subject to the requirements in subpart B of this part.</p>
