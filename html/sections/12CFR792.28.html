                            <p class="depth0">If you are not satisfied with NCUA's response to your request, you  can file an administrative appeal. Your appeal must be in writing and  must be filed within 30 days from receipt of the initial determination  (in cases of denials of an entire request, or denial of a request for  fee waiver or reduction), or from receipt of any records being made  available pursuant to the initial determination (in cases of partial  denials). In its response to your initial request, the Freedom of  Information Act Officer or the Inspector General (or designee), will  notify you that you may appeal any adverse determination to the Office  of General Counsel. The General Counsel, or designee, as set forth in  this paragraph, will:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20  working days after the receipt of such appeal. If, on appeal, the denial  of the request for records is, in whole or in part, upheld, the Office  of General Counsel will notify you of the provisions for judicial review  of that determination under FOIA. Where you do not address your appeal  to the General Counsel, the time limitations stated above will be  computed from the date of receipt of the appeal by the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The General Counsel is the official responsible for determining  all appeals from initial determinations. In case of this person's  absence, the appropriate officer acting in the General Counsel's stead  will make the appellate determination, unless such officer was  responsible for the initial determination, in which case the Vice- Chairman of the NCUA Board will make the appellate determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All appeals should be addressed to the General Counsel in the  Central Office and should be clearly identified as such on the envelope  and in the letter of appeal by using the indicator ``FOIA-APPEAL.''  Failure to address an appeal properly may delay commencement of the time  limitation stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to   take account of the time reasonably required to forward the appeal to  the Office of General Counsel.
