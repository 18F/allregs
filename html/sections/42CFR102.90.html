                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right of reconsideration. A requester has the right to seek reconsideration of the Secretary's determination that he or she is not eligible for payment. In addition, a requester who asserts that the amount of the benefits paid by the Secretary (or the fact that certain benefits were not paid or payable) is incorrect may also seek reconsideration. Letters seeking reconsideration must be in writing, describe the reason(s) why the decision should be reconsidered, and be postmarked within 60 calendar days of the date of the Secretary's decision on the request. Because no new documentation will be considered in the reconsideration process, the letter seeking reconsideration may not include or refer to any documentation that was not before the Secretary at the time of his initial determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Letters seeking reconsideration. A requester, or his or her representative, may send a letter seeking reconsideration through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial carrier, or a private courier service. The Secretary will not accept letters seeking reconsideration electronically or by hand-delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Letters sent through the U.S. Postal Service must be sent to the Associate Administrator, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, 5600 Fishers

Lane, Room 12-105, Rockville, Maryland 20857.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Letters sent through a commercial carrier or private courier service must be sent to the Associate Administrator, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Parklawn Building, Room 12-105, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reconsideration process. When the Associate Administrator of the Healthcare Systems Bureau (the Associate Administrator), receives a letter seeking reconsideration, a qualified panel will be convened, independent of the Program, to review the Secretary's initial determination. The panel will base its recommendation on the documentation before the Secretary when the initial determination(s) was made. The panel will perform its own review and make its own findings, which will be submitted to the Associate Administrator. The Associate Administrator will then review the panel's recommendation(s) and make a final determination, which will be sent to the requester (or his or her representative). This will be the Secretary's final action on the letter seeking reconsideration and will be considered the Secretary's final determination on the request. Requesters may not seek review of a decision made on reconsideration.
