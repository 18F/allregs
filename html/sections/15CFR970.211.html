                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Promptly after his receipt of an application and the opening of  coordinates describing the application area, the Administrator will  distribute a copy of the application to each other Federal agency or  department which, pursuant to section 103(e) of the Act, has identified  programs or activities within its statutory responsibilities which would  be affected by the activities proposed in the application (i.e., the  Departments of State, Transportation, Justice, Interior, Defense,  Treasury and Labor, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency,  Federal Trade Commission, Small Business Administration and National  Science Foundation). Based on its legal responsibilities and  authorities, each such agency or department may, not later than 60 days  after it receives a copy of the application which is in full compliance  with this subpart, recommend certification of the application, issuance  or transfer of the license, or denial of such certification, issuance or  transfer. The advice or recommendation by the Attorney General or  Federal Trade Commission on antitrust review, pursuant to Sec. 970.207,  must be submitted within 90 days after their receipt of a copy of the  application which is in full compliance with this subpart. NOAA will use  the benefits of this process of consultation and cooperation to  facilitate necessary Federal decisions on the proposed exploration  activities, pursuant to the mandate of section 103(e) of the Act to  reduce the number of separate actions required to satisfy Federal  agencies' statutory responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any case in which a Federal agency or department recommends a  denial, it will set forth in detail the manner in which the application  does not comply with any law or regulation within its area of  responsibility and will indicate how the application may be amended, or  how terms, conditions or restrictions might be added to the license to  assure compliance with such law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A recommendation from another Federal agency or department for  denying or amending an application will not affect its having been in  substantial compliance with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant  to Sec. 970.209, for purposes of establishing priority of right.  However, pursuant to section 103(e) of the Act, NOAA will cooperate with  such agencies and with the applicant with the goal of resolving the  concerns raised and satisfying the statutory responsibilities of these  agencies.
