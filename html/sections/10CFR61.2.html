Sec. 61.41 and 61.42 are met. Such active maintenance includes ongoing activities such as the pumping and treatment of water from a disposal unit or one-time measures such as replacement of a disposal unit cover. Active maintenance does not include custodial activities such as repair of fencing, repair or replacement of monitoring equipment, revegetation, minor additions to soil cover, minor repair of disposal unit covers, and general disposal site upkeep such as mowing grass.</p><p class="depth0">Buffer zone is a portion of the disposal site that is controlled by the licensee and that lies under the disposal units and between the disposal units and the boundary of the site.</p><p class="depth0">Chelating agent means amine polycarboxylic acids (e.g., EDTA, DTPA), hydroxy-carboxylic acids, and polycarboxylic acids (e.g., citric acid, carbolic acid, and glucinic acid).</p><p class="depth0">Commencement of construction means any clearing of land, excavation, or other substantial action that would adversely affect the environment of a land disposal facility. The term does not mean disposal site exploration, necessary roads for disposal site exploration, borings to determine foundation conditions, or other preconstruction monitoring or testing to establish background information related to the suitability of the disposal site or the protection of environmental values.</p><p class="depth0">Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth0">Custodial Agency means an agency of the government designated to act on behalf of the government owner of the disposal site.</p><p class="depth0">Director means the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal means the isolation of radioactive wastes from the biosphere inhabited by man and containing his food

chains by emplacement in a land disposal facility.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal site means that portion of a land disposal facility which is used for disposal of waste. It consists of disposal units and a buffer zone.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal unit means a discrete portion of the disposal site into which waste is placed for disposal. For near-surface disposal the unit is usually a trench.</p><p class="depth0">Engineered barrier means a man-made structure or device that is intended to improve the land disposal facility's ability to meet the performance objectives in subpart C.</p><p class="depth0">Explosive material means any chemical compound, mixture, or device, which produces a substantial instantaneous release of gas and heat spontaneously or by contact with sparks or flame.</p><p class="depth0">Government agency means any executive department, commission, independent establishment, or corporation, wholly or partly owned by the United States of America which is an instrumentality of the United States; or any board, bureau, division, service, office, officer, authority, administration, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous waste means those wastes designated as hazardous by Environmental Protection Agency regulations in 40 CFR part 261.</p><p class="depth0">Hydrogeologic unit means any soil or rock unit or zone which by virtue of its porosity or permeability, or lack thereof, has a distinct influence on the storage or movement of groundwater.</p><p class="depth0">Inadvertent intruder means a person who might occupy the disposal site after closure and engage in normal activities, such as agriculture, dwelling construction, or other pursuits in which the person might be unknowingly exposed to radiation from the waste.</p><p class="depth0">Indian Tribe means an Indian tribe as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450).</p><p class="depth0">Intruder barrier means a sufficient depth of cover over the waste that inhibits contact with waste and helps to ensure that radiation exposures to an inadvertent intruder will meet the performance objectives set forth in this part, or engineered structures that provide equivalent protection to the inadvertent intruder.</p><p class="depth0">Land disposal facility means the land, building, and structures, and equipment which are intended to be used for the disposal of radioactive wastes. For purposes of this chapter, a ``geologic repository'' as defined in part 60 or 63 is not considered a land disposal facility.</p><p class="depth0">License means a license issued under the regulations in part 61 of this chapter. Licensee means the holder of such a license.</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring means observing and making measurements to provide data to evaluate the performance and characteristics of the disposal site.</p><p class="depth0">Near-surface disposal facility means a land disposal facility in which radioactive waste is disposed of in or within the upper 30 meters of the earth's surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, government agency other than the Commission or the Department of Energy (except that the Department of Energy is considered a person within the meaning of the regulations in this part to the extent that its facilities and activities are subject to the licensing and related regulatory authority of the Commission pursuant to law), any State or any political subdivision of or any political entity within a State, any foreign government or nation or any political subdivision of any such government or nation, or other entity; and (2) any legal successor, representative, agent, or agency of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth2">Pyrophoric liquid means any liquid that ignites spontaneously in dry or moist air at or below 130 [deg]F (54.5 [deg]C). A pyrophoric solid is any solid material, other than one classed as an explosive, which under normal conditions is liable to cause fires through friction, retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which can be ignited readily and when ignited burns so vigorously and persistently as to create a serious transportation, handling, or disposal hazard. Included are spontaneously combustible and water-reactive materials.</p><p class="depth2">Site closure and stablization means those actions that are taken upon completion of operations that prepare the disposal site for custodial care and that assure that the disposal site will remain stable and will not need ongoing active maintenance.</p><p class="depth2">State means any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth2">Stability means structural stabillity.</p><p class="depth2">Surveillance means observation of the disposal site for purposes of visual detection of need for maintenance, custodial care, evidence of intrusion, and compliance with other license and regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth2">Tribal Governing Body means a Tribal organization as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450).</p><p class="depth2">Waste means those low-level radioactive wastes containing source, special nuclear, or byproduct material that are acceptable for disposal in a land disposal facility. For the purposes of this definition, low-level radioactive waste means radioactive waste not classified as high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material as defined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of the definition of Byproduct material set forth in Sec. 20.1003 of this chapter.
