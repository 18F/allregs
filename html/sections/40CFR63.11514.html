Descriptions of these source categories are shown in Table 1 of this subpart. ``Primarily engaged'' is defined in Sec. 63.11522, ``What definitions apply to this subpart?''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Electrical and Electronic Equipment Finishing Operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fabricated Metal Products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fabricated Plate Work (Boiler Shops);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Heating Equipment, except Electric;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Industrial Machinery and Equipment Finishing Operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Iron and Steel Forging;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Primary Metal Products Manufacturing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Valves and Pipe Fittings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this subpart apply to each new and existing affected source listed and defined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section if you use materials that contain or have the potential to emit metal fabrication or finishing metal HAP (MFHAP), defined to be the compounds of cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel, or any of these metals in the elemental form with the exception of lead. Materials that contain MFHAP are defined to be materials that contain greater than 0.1 percent for carcinogens, as defined by OSHA at 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), and greater than 1.0 percent for noncarcinogens. For the MFHAP, this corresponds to materials that contain cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight (of the metal), and materials that contain manganese in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight (of the metal), as shown in formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A dry abrasive blasting affected source is the collection of all equipment and activities necessary to perform dry abrasive blasting operations which use materials that contain MFHAP or that have the potential to emit MFHAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A machining affected source is the collection of all equipment and activities necessary to perform machining operations which use materials that contain MFHAP, as defined in Sec. 63.11522, ``What definitions apply to this subpart?'', or that have the potential to emit MFHAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A dry grinding and dry polishing with machines affected source is the collection of all equipment and activities necessary to perform dry grinding
