such pinnipeds and polar bears during periods of transport by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Keeping the animal cooled and/or warmed sufficiently to prevent overheating, hypothermia, or temperature related stress; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calming the marine mammals to avoid struggling, thrashing, and other unnecessary activity that may cause overheating or physical trauma.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sea otters must be transported in primary enclosures that contain false floors through which water and waste freely pass to keep the interior of the transport unit free from waste materials. Moisture must be provided by water sprayers or ice during transport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Marine mammals may be removed from their primary transport enclosures only by the attendants or other persons capable of handling such mammals safely.
