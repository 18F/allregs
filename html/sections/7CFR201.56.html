                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A seed shall be considered to have germinated when it has  developed those essential structures which, for the kind of seed under  consideration, are indicative of its ability to produce a normal plant  under favorable conditions. In general, the following are considered to  be essential structures necessary for the continued development of the  seedling (although some structures may not be visible in all kinds at  the time of seedling evaluation). Seedlings possessing these essential  structures are referred to as normal seedlings: Root system (consisting  of primary, secondary, seminal, or adventitious roots); hypocotyl;  epicotyl; cotyledon(s); terminal bud; primary leaves; and coleoptile and  mesocotyl (in the grass family). Abnormal seedlings consist of those  with defects to these structures, as described in the abnormal seedling  descriptions, and are judged to be incapable of continued growth. The  seedling descriptions assume that test conditions were adequate to allow  proper assessment of the essential seedling structures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sand and/or soil tests may be used as a guide in determining the  classification of questionable seedlings and the evaluation of  germination tests made on approved artificial media. This is intended to  provide a method of checking the reliability of tests made on artificial  substrata when there may be doubt as to the proper evaluation of such  tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Seedlings infected with fungi or bacteria should be regarded as  normal if all essential structures are present. A seedling that has been  seriously damaged by bacteria or fungi from any source other than the  specific seed should be regarded as normal if it is determined that all  essential structures were present before the injury or damage occurred.  Germination counts should be made on samples where contamination and  decay are present at approximately 2-day intervals between the usual  first count and the final count. During the progress of the germination  test, seeds which are obviously dead and moldy and which may be a source  of contamination of healthy seeds should be removed at each count and  the number of such dead seeds should be recorded. When symptoms of  certain diseases develop which can be readily recognized and identified,  their presence should be noted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Seed units containing more than one seed or embryo, such as New  Zealand spinach seed, Beta seed, double fruits of the carrot family  (Umbelliferae), multiple seeds of burnet, and seed units of grasses  consisting of multiple florets, shall be tested as a single seed and  shall be regarded as having germinated if they produce one or more  normal seedlings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standard guides for seedling interpretation shall include the  following descriptions for specific kinds and groups. The ``General  Description'' for each group of crop kinds describes a seedling without  defects. While such a seedling is clearly normal, seedlings with some  defects may also be classified as normal, provided the defects do not  impair the functioning of the structure. The ``Abnormal seedling  description'' is to be followed when judging the severity of defects.  [20 FR 7931, Oct. 21, 1955, as amended at 25 FR 8771, Sept. 13, 1960; 59  FR 64500, Dec. 14, 1994]</p>
