To aid the Secretary in prescribing such other minimum standards, the Committee shall furnish to the Secretary the data upon which it acted in recommending such standards. The provisions hereof relating to minimum standards of grades and sizes for marketable dates and inspection requirements, within the meaning of section 2(3) of the act, and any other provisions relating to the administration and enforcement thereof shall continue in effect irrespective of whether the season average price to producers for dates is or is not in excess of the parity level specified in section 2(1) of the act. Notice of the minimum standard regulation shall be sent by the Committee to all handlers of record. On and after the effective date of such regulations no handler shall handle dates except in accordance with such minimum standard.
