                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The FOIA provides for access to records developed or maintained by a Federal agency. The provisions of the FOIA are intended to assure the right of the public to information. Generally, this section divides agency records into three major categories and provides methods by which each category of records is to be made available to the public. The three major categories of records are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required to be published in the Federal Register (see Sec. 1301.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information required to be made available for public inspection and copying or, in the alternative, to be published and offered for sale (see Sec. 1301.4); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information required to be made available to any member of the public upon specific request (see Sec. Sec. 1301.5 through 1301.12).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Right of access. Subject to the exemptions and exclusions set forth in the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), and the regulations set forth in this subpart, any person shall be afforded access to records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemptions. (1) The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) do not apply to certain records which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain records which are excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) do not apply to certain records which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain records which are excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Even though a FOIA exemption set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) may apply to the record requested, the Council may, if not precluded by law, elect under the circumstances of that request not to apply the exemption. The fact that an exemption is not applied by the Council in response to a particular request shall have no precedential significance in processing other requests. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</p>
