                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term total residual chlorine (or total residual oxidants for intake water with bromides) means the value obtained using any of the ``chlorine--total residual'' methods in Table IB in 40 CFR 136.3(a), or other methods approved by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term low volume waste sources means, taken collectively as if from one source, wastewater from all sources except those for which specific limitations are otherwise established in this part. Low volume wastes sources include, but are not limited to:

wastewaters from wet scrubber air pollution control systems, ion exchange water treatment system, water treatment evaporator blowdown, laboratory and sampling streams, boiler blowdown, floor drains, cooling tower basin cleaning wastes, and recirculating house service water systems. Sanitary and air conditioning wastes are not included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term chemical metal cleaning waste means any wastewater resulting from the cleaning of any metal process equipment with chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, boiler tube cleaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term metal cleaning waste means any wastewater resulting from cleaning [with or without chemical cleaning compounds] any metal process equipment including, but not limited to, boiler tube cleaning, boiler fireside cleaning, and air preheater cleaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term fly ash means the ash that is carried out of the furnace by the gas stream and collected by mechanical precipitators, electrostatic precipitators, and/or fabric filters. Economizer ash is included when it is collected with fly ash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term bottom ash means the ash that drops out of the furnace gas stream in the furnace and in the economizer sections. Economizer ash is included when it is collected with bottom ash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term once through cooling water means water passed through the main cooling condensers in one or two passes for the purpose of removing waste heat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term recirculated cooling water means water which is passed through the main condensers for the purpose of removing waste heat, passed through a cooling device for the purpose of removing such heat from the water and then passed again, except for blowdown, through the main condenser.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The term 10 year, 24/hour rainfall event means a rainfall event with a probable recurrence interval of once in ten years as defined by the National Weather Service in Technical Paper No. 40. Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States, May 1961 or equivalent regional rainfall probability information developed therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The term blowdown means the minimum discharge of recirculating water for the purpose of discharging materials contained in the water, the further buildup of which would cause concentration in amounts exceeding limits established by best engineering practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term average concentration as it relates to chlorine discharge means the average of analyses made over a single period of chlorine release which does not exceed two hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The term free available chlorine means the value obtained using any of the ``chlorine--free available'' methods in Table IB in 40 CFR 136.3(a) where the method has the capability of measuring free available chlorine, or other methods approved by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The term coal pile runoff means the rainfall runoff from or through any coal storage pile.
