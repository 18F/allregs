Any additional data transport or handling requirements exceeding  NASA's capability will be dealt with as a mission-unique service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No storage of the user data is provided in the standard service.  NASA will provide short-term temporary recording of data at WSC in the  event of a NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) link outage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NASA will provide TDRSS services on a ``reasonable efforts''  basis, and, accordingly, will not be liable for damages of any kind to  the user or third parties for any reason, including, but not limited to,  failure to provide agreed-to services. The price for TDRSS services does  not include a contingency or premium for any potential damages. The user  will assume any   risk of damages or obtain insurance to protect against any risk.
