                                Sec. 1.1368-3  Examples.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1368-1 and 1.1368-2 are illustrated  by the examples below. In each example Corporation S is a calendar year  corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S, an S corporation, has no earnings and profits as of  January 1, 1996, the first day of its 1996 taxable year. S's sole  shareholder, A, holds 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $1 per share  as of that date. On March 1, 1996, S makes a distribution of $38 to A.  For S's 1996 taxable year, A's pro rata share of the amount of the items  described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of  stock) is $50 and A's pro rata share of the amount of the items  described in section 1367(a)(2) (B) through (D) (relating to decreases  in basis of stock for items other than distributions) is $26.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 1368(d)(1) and Sec. 1.1368-1(e)(1), the  adjustments to the bases of A's stock in S described in section 1367 are  made before the distribution rules of section 1368 are applied. Thus,  A's basis per share in the stock is $3.40 ($1 + [($50-$26) / 10 shares])  before taking into account the distribution. Under section  1367(a)(2)(A), the basis of A's stock is decreased by distributions to A  that are not includible in A's income. Under Sec. 1.1367-1(c)(3), the  amount of the distribution that is attributable to each share of A's  stock is $3.80 ($38 distribution / 10 shares). However, A only has a  basis of $3.40 in each share, and basis may not be reduced below zero.  Therefore, the basis of each share of his stock is reduced by $3.40 to  zero, and the remaining $4.00 of the distribution ([$3.80-$3.40] x 10  shares) is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. As of  January 1, 1997, A has a basis of $0 in his shares of S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Corporation S, an S corporation, has no earnings and profits as of  January 1, 2001, the first day of its 2001 taxable year. S's sole  shareholder, A, holds 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $1 per share  as of that date. On March 1, 2001, S makes a distribution of $38 to A.  The balance in Corporation S's AAA is $100. For S's 2001 taxable year,  A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section  1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of stock) is $50. A's pro  rata share of the amount of the items described in sections  1367(a)(2)(B) through (D) (relating to decreases in basis of stock for  items other than distributions) is $26, $20 of which is attributable to  items described in section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C) and $6 of which is  attributable to items described in section 1367(a)(2)(D) (relating to  decreases in basis attributable to noncapital, nondeductible expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 1368(d)(1) and Sec. 1.1368-1(e)(1) and (2), the  adjustments to the basis of A's stock in S described in sections  1367(a)(1) are made before the distribution rules of section 1368 are  applied. Thus, A's basis per share in the stock is $6.00 ($1 + [$50/10])  before taking into account the distribution. Under section  1367(a)(2)(A), the basis of A's stock is decreased by distributions to A  that are not includible in A's income. Under Sec. 1.1367-1(c)(3), the  amount of the distribution that is attributable to each share of A's  stock is $3.80 ($38 distribution/10 shares). Thus, A's basis per share  in the stock is $2.20 ($6.00-$3.80), after taking into account the  distribution. Under section 1367(a)(2)(D), the basis of each share of  A's stock in S after taking into account the distribution, $2.20, is  decreased by $.60 ($6 noncapital, nondeductible expenses/10). Thus, A's  basis per share after taking into account the nondeductible, noncapital  expenses is $1.60. Under section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C), A's basis per  share is further decreased by $2 ($20 items described in section  1367(a)(2)(B) and (C)/10 shares). However, basis may not be reduced  below zero. Therefore, the basis of each share of A's stock is reduced  to zero. As of January 1, 2002, A has a basis of $0 in his shares of S  stock. Pursuant to section 1366(d)(2), the $.40 of loss in excess of A's  basis in each of his shares of S stock is treated as incurred by the  corporation in the succeeding taxable year with respect to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S properly elects to be an S corporation beginning  January 1, 1997, and as of that date has accumulated earnings and  profits of $30. B, an individual and sole shareholder of Corporation S,  has 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $12 per share. In addition, B  lends $30 to S evidenced by a demand note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During 1997, S has a nonseparately computed loss of $150. S  makes no distributions to B during 1997. Under section 1366(d)(1), B is  allowed a loss equal to $150, the amount equal to the sum of B's bases  in his shares of stock and his basis in the debt. Under section 1367,  the loss reduces B's adjusted basis in his stock and debt to $0. Under  Sec. 1.1368-2(a)(3), S's AAA as of December 31, 1997, has a deficit of  $150 as a result of S's loss for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 1998, S has $220 of separately stated income and  distributes $110 to B. The balance in the AAA (negative $150 from 1997)  is increased by $220 for S's income for the year and decreased to $0 for  the portion of the distribution that is treated as being from the AAA  ($70). Under Sec. 1.1367-2(c), B's net increase is $150, determined by  reducing the   $220 of income by the $70 of the distribution not includible in income  by B. Thus, B's basis in the debt is fully restored to $30, and B's  basis in S stock (before accounting for the distribution) is increased  from zero to $19 per share ([$220-$30 applied to the debt] / 10). Thirty  dollars of the distribution is considered a dividend to the extent of  S's $30 of earnings and profits, and the remaining $10 of the  distribution reduces B's basis in the S stock. Thus, B's basis in the S  stock as of December 31, 1998, is $11 per share ($19-[$70 AAA  distribution / 10]-[10 distribution treated as a reduction in basis /  10]). The balance in the AAA is $0, S's earnings and profits are $0, and  B's basis in the loan is $30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S, an S corporation, has accumulated  earnings and profits of $1,000 and a balance in the AAA of $2,000 on  January 1, 2001. S's sole shareholder B holds 100 shares of stock with a  basis of $20 per share as of January 1, 2001. On April 1, 2001, S makes  a distribution of $1,500 to B. B's pro rata share of the income earned  by S during 2001 is $2,000 and B's pro rata share of S's losses is  $1,500. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2001, S does not have a  net negative adjustment as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C). S does not  make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1368-1(f)(2) to  distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AAA is increased from $2,000 to $4,000 for the $2,000 of  income earned during the 2001 taxable year. The AAA is decreased from  $4,000 to $2,500 for the $1,500 of losses. The AAA is decreased from  $2,500 to $1,000 for the portion of the distribution ($1,500) to B that  does not exceed the AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As of December 31, 2001, B's basis in his stock is $10 ($20 +  $20 ($2,000 income/100 shares)--$15 ($1,500 distribution/100 shares)-- $15 ($1,500 loss/100 shares).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S, an S corporation, has accumulated  earnings and profits of $1,000 and a balance in the AAA of $2,000 on  January 1, 2001. S's sole shareholder B holds 100 shares of stock with a  basis of $20 per share as of January 1, 2001. On April 1, 2001, S makes  a distribution of $2,000 to B. B's pro rata share of the income earned  by S during 2001 is $2,000 and B's pro rata share of S's losses is  $3,500. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2001, S has a net  negative adjustment as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C). S does not make  the election under section 1368(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1368-1(f)(2) to  distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the net negative adjustment  is not taken into account, the AAA is decreased from $4,000 to $2,000  for the portion of the losses ($2,000) that does not exceed the income  earned during the 2001 taxable year. The AAA is reduced from $2,000 to  zero for the portion of the distribution to B ($2,000) that does not  exceed the AAA. The AAA is decreased from zero to a negative $1,500 for  the portion of the $3,500 of loss that exceeds the $2,000 of income  earned during the 2001 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1367-1(c)(1), the basis of a shareholder's share  in an S corporation stock may not be reduced below zero. Accordingly, as  of December 31, 2001, B's basis per share in his stock is zero ($20 +  $20 income--$20 distribution--$35 loss). Pursuant to section 1366(d)(2),  the $15 of loss in excess of B's basis in each of his shares of S stock  is treated as incurred by the corporation in the succeeding taxable year  with respect to B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S, an S corporation, has earnings and profits of  $3,000 and a balance in the AAA of $1,000 on January 1, 1997. C, an  individual and the sole shareholder of Corporation S, has 100 shares of  S stock with a basis of $10 per share. On July 3, 1997, C sells 50  shares of his S stock to D, an individual, for $250. For 1997, S has  taxable income of $1,000, of which $500 was earned on or before July 3,  1997, and $500 earned after July 3, 1997. During its 1997 taxable year,  S distributes $1,000 to C on February 1 and $1,000 to each of C and D on  August 1. S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and  Sec. 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its  AAA. S makes the election under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2) to treat its  taxable year as if it consisted of separate taxable years, the first of  which ends at the close of July 3, 1997, the date of the qualifying  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2), for the period ending on  July 3, 1997, S's AAA is $500 ($1,000 (AAA as of January 1, 1997) + $500  (income earned from January 1, 1997 through July 3, 1997)-$1,000  (distribution made on February 1, 1997)). C's bases in his shares of  stock is decreased to $5 per share ($10 (original basis) + $5 (increase  per share for income)-$10 (decrease per share for distribution)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The AAA is adjusted at the end of the taxable year for the  period July 4 through December 31, 1997. It is increased from $500 (AAA  as of the close of July 3, 1997) to $1,000 for the income earned during  this period and is decreased by $1,000, the portion of the distribution  ($2,000 in total) made to C and D on August 1 that does not exceed the  AAA. The $1,000 portion of the distribution that remains after the AAA  is reduced to zero is attributable to earnings and profits. Therefore C  and D each have a dividend of $500, which   does not affect their basis or S's AAA. The earnings and profits account  is reduced from $3,000 to $2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> As of December 31, 1997, C and D have bases in their shares of  stock of zero ($5 (basis as of July 4)+$5 ($500 income/100 shares)-$10  ($1,000 distribution/100 shares)). C and D each will report $500 as  dividend income, which does not affect their basis or S's AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Corporation S has been a calendar year C corporation since 1975. For  1982, S elects for the first time to be taxed under subchapter S, and  during 1982 has $60 of earnings and profits. As of December 31, 1995, S  has an AAA of $10 and earnings and profits of $160, consisting of $100  of subchapter C earnings and profits and $60 of subchapter S earnings  and profits. For 1996, S has $200 of taxable income and the AAA is  increased to $210 (before taking distributions into account). During  1996, S distributes $240 to its shareholders. With its 1996 tax return,  S properly elects under section 1368(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1368-1(f)(2) to  distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because S elected to distribute its earnings and profits before  its AAA, the first $100 of the distribution is characterized as a  distribution from subchapter C earnings and profits; the next $60 of the  distribution is characterized as a distribution from subchapter S  earnings and profits. Because $160 of the distribution is from earnings  and profits, the shareholders of S have a $160 dividend. The remaining  $80 of the distribution is a distribution from S's AAA and is treated by  the shareholders as a return of capital or gain from the sale or  exchange of property, as appropriate, under Sec. 1.1368-1(d)(1). S's  AAA, as of December 31, 1996, equals $130 ($210-$80).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1,  1995, Corporation S has $40 of earnings and profits and a balance in the  AAA of $100. S has two shareholders, E and F, each of whom own 50 shares  of S's stock. For 1995, S has taxable income of $50, which increases the  AAA to $150 as of December 31, 1995 (before taking into account  distributions made during 1995). On February 1, 1995, S distributes $60  to each shareholder. On September 1, 1995, S distributes $30 to each  shareholder. S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and  Sec. 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its  AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the distributions exceed S's AAA. Therefore, under  Sec. 1.1368-2(b), a portion of S's $150 balance in the AAA as of  December 31, 1995, is allocated to each of the February 1 and September  1 distributions based on the respective sizes of the distributions.  Accordingly, S must allocate $100 ($150 (AAA)x($120 (February 1  distribution)/$180 (the sum of the distributions))) of the AAA to the  February 1 distribution, and $50 ($150x($60/$180)) to the September 1  distribution. The portions of the distributions to which the AAA is  allocated are treated by the shareholder as a return of capital or gain  from the sale or exchange of property, as appropriate. The remainder of  the two distributions is treated as a dividend to the extent that it  does not exceed S's earnings and profits. E and F must each report $10  of dividend income for the February 1 distribution. For the September 1  distribution, E and F must each report $5 of dividend income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, Corporation S, an S corporation, has $20  of earnings and profits and a balance in the AAA of $10. S has two  shareholders, G and H, each of whom owns 50 shares of S's stock. For  1995, S has taxable income of $16, which increases the AAA to $26 as of  December 31, 1995 (before taking into account distributions made during  1995). On February 1, 1995, S distributes $10 to each shareholder. On  December 31, 1995, S redeems for $13 all of shareholder G's stock in a  redemption that is treated as a sale or exchange under section 302(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the ordinary distributions does not exceed S's AAA.  Therefore, S must reduce the $26 balance in the AAA by $20 for the  February 1 ordinary distribution. The portions of the distribution by  which the AAA is reduced are treated by the shareholders as a return of  capital or gain from the sale or exchange of property. S must adjust the  remaining AAA, $6, in an amount equal to the ratable share of the  remaining AAA attributable to the redeemed stock, or $3 (50%x$6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S also must adjust the earnings and profits of $20 in an  amount equal to the ratable share of the earnings and profits  attributable to the redeemed stock. Therefore, S adjusts the earnings  and profits by $10 (50%x$20), the ratable share of the earnings and  profits attributable to the redeemed stock.  [T.D. 8508, 59 FR 22, Jan. 3, 1994; 59 FR 10675, Mar. 7, 1994, as  amended by T.D. 8852, 64 FR 71650, Dec. 22, 1999]</p>
