                            <p class="depth0">Lenders are required to pay to SBA fees to cover costs of examinations and reviews and, if assessed by SBA, other Lender oversight activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fee components: The fees may cover the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On-site examinations. The costs of conducting on-site safety and soundness examinations of an SBA-Supervised Lender, including any expenses that are incurred in relation to the examination. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ``SBA-Supervised Lender'' means a Small Business Lending Company or a Non-Federally Regulated Lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On-site reviews. The costs of conducting an on-site review of a Lender, including any expenses that are incurred in relation to the review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Off-site reviews/monitoring. The costs of conducting off-site reviews/monitoring of a Lender, including any expenses that are incurred in relation to the review/monitoring activities. SBA will assess this charge based on each Lender's portion of the total dollar amount of SBA guarantees in SBA's portfolio. SBA may waive the assessment of this fee for all Lenders owing less than a threshold amount below which SBA determines that it is not cost effective to collect the fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other lender oversight activities. The costs of additional expenses that SBA incurs in carrying out Lender oversight activities (for example, the salaries and travel expenses of SBA employees and equipment expenses that are directly related to carrying out Lender oversight activities). This charge will be based on each Lender's portion of the total dollar amount of SBA guarantees in SBA's portfolio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Billing process. For the on-site examinations or reviews conducted under (a)(1) and (a)(2) above, SBA will bill each Lender for the amount owed following completion of the examination or review. For the off-site reviews/monitoring conducted under (a)(3) above and the other Lender oversight expenses incurred under (a)(4) above, SBA will bill each Lender for the amount owed on an annual basis. SBA will state in the bill the date by which payment is due SBA and the approved payment method(s). The payment due date will be no less than 30 calendar days from the bill date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delinquent payment and late-payment charges. Payments that are not received by the due date specified in the bill shall be considered delinquent. SBA will charge interest, and other applicable charges and penalties, on delinquent payments, as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3717. SBA may waive or abate the collection of interest, charges and/or penalties if circumstances warrant. In addition, a Lender's failure to pay any of the fee components described in this section, or to pay interest, charges and penalties that have been charged, may result in a decision to suspend or revoke a participant's eligibility or to limit a participant's delegated authority.</p><p class="depth2">Enforcement Actions</p>
