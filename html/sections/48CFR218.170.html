See PGI 208.7004-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card.

See 213.270(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Master agreement for repair and alteration of vessels. The contracting officer, without soliciting offers, may issue a written job order for emergency work to a contractor that has previously executed a master agreement, when delay would endanger a vessel, its cargo or stores, or when military necessity requires immediate work on a vessel. See 217.7103-4, 252.217-7010, and PGI 217.7103-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Spare parts breakout program. An urgent immediate buy need not be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be completed in

time to meet the required delivery date. See PGI 217.7506, paragraph 1-105(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. Under certain emergency situations, exceptions apply with regard to the prohibition on storage or disposal of non-DoD-owned toxic or hazardous materials on DoD installations. See 223.7102(a)(3) and (7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Authorization Acts, Appropriations Acts, and other statutory restrictions on foreign acquisition. Acquisitions in the following categories are not subject to the restrictions of 225.7002, Restrictions on food, clothing, fabrics, specialty metals, and hand or measuring tools: (1) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold; (2) Acquisitions outside the United States in support of combat operations; (3) Acquisitions of perishable foods by or for activities located outside the United States for personnel of those activities; (4) Acquisitions of food, specialty metals, or hand or measuring tools in support of contingency operations, or for which the use of other than competitive procedures has been approved on the basis of unusual and compelling urgency in accordance with FAR 6.302-2; (5) Emergency acquisitions by activities located outside the United States for personnel of those activities; and (6) Acquisitions by vessels in foreign waters. See 225.7002-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Rights in technical data. The agency head may notify a person asserting a restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances (e.g., emergency repair or overhaul) do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 227.7102-2; 227.7103-5; 227.7103-13; 227.7104; 227.7203-13; 252.227-7013; 252.227-7014; 252.227-7015; 252.227-7018; and 252.227-7037.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Tax exemption in Spain. If copies of a contract are not available and duty-free import of equipment or materials is urgent, the contracting officer may send the Joint United States Military Group copies of the Letter of Intent or a similar document indicating the pending award. See PGI 229.7001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Electronic submission and processing of payment requests. Exceptions to the use of Wide Area WorkFlow are at 232.7002(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Mortuary services.
