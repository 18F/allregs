Grantee and delegate agencies must coordinate, to the extent possible, with families and other agencies to support the accomplishment of goals in the preexisting plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A variety of opportunities must be created by grantee and delegate agencies for interaction with parents throughout the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Meetings and interactions with families must be respectful of each family's diversity and cultural and ethnic background.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accessing community services and resources.
