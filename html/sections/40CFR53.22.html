                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Table B-2 to subpart B of part 53 specifies preferred methods  for generating test atmospheres and suggested methods of verifying their  concentrations. Only one means of establishing the concentration of a  test atmosphere is normally required, provided that that means is  adequately accurate and credible. If the method of generation can  produce accurate, reproducible concentrations, verification is optional.  If the method of generation is not reproducible or reasonably  quantifiable, then establishment of the concentration by some credible  verification method is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test atmosphere delivery system shall be designed and  constructed so as not to significantly alter the test atmosphere  composition or concentration during the period of the test. The system  shall be vented to insure that test atmospheres are presented to the  test analyzer at very nearly atmospheric pressure. The delivery system  shall be fabricated from borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon, or other  material that is inert with regard to the gas or gases to be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The output of the test atmosphere generation system shall be  sufficiently stable to obtain stable response readings from the test  analyzer during the required tests. If a permeation device is used for  generation of a test atmosphere, the device, as well as the air passing  over it, shall be controlled to 0.1 C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All diluent air shall be zero air free of contaminants likely to  react with the test atmospheres or cause a detectable response on the  test analyzer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The concentration of each test atmosphere used shall be  quantitatively established and/or verified before or during each series  of tests. Samples for verifying test concentrations shall be collected  from the test atmosphere delivery system as close as feasible to the  sample intake port of the test analyzer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The accuracy of all flow measurements used to calculate test  atmosphere concentrations shall be documented and referenced to a  primary flow rate or volume standard (such as a spirometer, bubble  meter, etc.). Any corrections shall be clearly shown. All flow  measurements given in volume units shall be standardized to 25 C and  760 mm Hg.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Schematic drawings, photos, descriptions, and other information  showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation,  verification, and delivery system shall be provided. All pertinent  calculations shall be clearly indicated.</p>
