                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability of credit from other sources. The Agency must determine that the borrower is unable to obtain the required credit without the loan guarantee from private, commercial, or cooperative sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time. This determination shall become a part of the Agency casefile. The Agency must also determine if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than the U.S. Tax Court) has been entered against the borrower or if the borrower has an outstanding delinquent debt with any Federal agency. Such judgment or delinquency shall cause the potential borrower to be ineligible to receive a loan guarantee until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied or the delinquency is cured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Legal authority and responsibility. (1) Each borrower must have, or will obtain, the legal authority necessary to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facility and services. They must also have legal authority for obtaining security and repaying the proposed loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each borrower must have, or will obtain, the legal authority necessary to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facility and services. They must also have legal authority for obtaining security and repaying the proposed loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The borrower shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility and services, and providing for the continued availability and use of the facility and services at reasonable rates and terms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> These responsibilities must be exercised by the borrower even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract, management agreement, or written lease.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Leases may only be used when this is the only feasible way to provide the service, is the customary practice to provide such service in the State, and must provide for the borrower's management control of the facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contracts, management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender is responsible for reviewing any contracts, management agreements, or leases to determine that they will not adversely impact the borrower's repayment ability or the security value of the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Borrower. (1) A public body such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a State located in a rural area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A public body such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a State located in a rural area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis such as an association, cooperative, or private corporation. For-profit corporations operated as not-for-profit corporations are eligible borrowers as long as they operate as a not-for-profit corporation for the duration of their guaranteed loans. Single member corporations or corporations owned or substantially controlled by other corporations or associations are not eligible organizations. Before a loan is made to a borrower other than a public body, the articles of incorporation or the loan agreement will include a condition similar to the following:</p><p class="depth3">If the corporation dissolves or ceases to perform the community facility objectives and functions, the board of directors shall distribute all business property and assets to one or more nonprofit corporations or public bodies. This distribution must be approved by 75 percent of the users or members and must serve the public welfare of the community. The assets may not be distributed to any members, directors, stockholders, or others having financial or managerial interest in the corporation. Nothing herein shall prohibit the corporation from paying its debts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A private nonprofit essential community facility (other than utilities) must have significant ties with the local rural community. Such ties are necessary to ensure to the greatest extent possible that a facility under private control will carry out a public purpose and continue to primarily serve rural areas. Ties may be evidenced by items such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Association with, or controlled by, a local public body or bodies or broadly based ownership and controlled by members of the community.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial public funding through taxes, revenue bonds, or other local government sources, or substantial voluntary community funding such as would be obtained through a community-wide funding campaign.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Facility location. Facilities must be located in rural areas, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For utility services such as natural gas or hydroelectric serving both rural and non-rural areas. In such cases, Agency funds may be used to finance only that portion serving rural areas, regardless of facility location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Telecommunication projects. The part of the facility located in a non-rural area must be necessary to provide the essential services to rural areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Facilities for public use. All facilities financed under the provisions of this subpart shall be for public purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities will be installed to serve any user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In no case will boundaries for the proposed service area be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, disability, or national origin. This does not preclude:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system or facility and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to, or parts thereof. Additionally, the borrower must publicly announce a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service. Also, the borrower must provide written notice to potential users located in the areas not to be initially served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender will determine that, when feasible and legally possible, inequities within the proposed project's service area for the same type service proposed (i.e., gas distribution system) will be remedied by the owner on, or before, completion of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy, or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems or facilities that were developed under different financing, rates, terms, or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.
