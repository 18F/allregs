                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To receive information concerning the availability of Federal  excess personal property, an eligible institution's property management  officer may contact their regional GSA, Area Utilization Officer. For  information on USDA excess personal property, visit the USDA Web site at  http://www.nfc.usda.gov/propexcs. USDA excess property will first be  screened by USDA agencies through the Departmental Excess Personal  Property Coordinator (DEPPC) using the Departmental Property Management  Information System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excess property selected by screeners of eligible institutions  should be inspected whenever possible, or the holding agency should be  contacted to verify the condition of the items, because interpretation  of condition codes varies among Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the condition of the item is acceptable, the institution  should ``freeze'' (reserve) items by calling the appropriate GSA office  or USDA Departmental Excess Personal Property Coordinator (DEPPC). Since  GSA may have several ``freezes'' on a piece of equipment, it is critical  that the paperwork be submitted as soon as possible. Further, while  transfers of excess personal property normally will be approved by GSA  on a first-come-first-serve basis, consideration will be given   to such factors as national defense requirements, emergency needs,  preclusion of new procurement, energy conservation, equitable  distribution, and retention of title in the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eligible institutions may submit property requests by mail or  fax on a Standard Form 122, ``Transfer Order Excess Personal Property''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The SF-122 should be signed by the eligible institution's  property management officer or authorized designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following information should also be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Date prepared.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> GSA/DEPPC address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ordering Agency and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Holding Agency and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Name and address of Institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Location of property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Shipping instruction (including institution contact person and  phone number).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Complete description of property including original  acquisition cost, serial number, condition code, and quantity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This statement needs to be added following the property  description:</p><p class="depth3">``The property requested hereon is certified to be used in support  of research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or for  related programs. This transfer is requested pursuant to the provisions  of Section 923 Pub. L. 104-127 (7 U.S.C. 2206a). Also, in accordance  with these provisions USDA authorizes transfer of title of this property  to the college/university/institution.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The SF-122 should be forwarded to USDA for approval and  signature by an authorized USDA official. As confirmation of approval,  the eligible institution's property management officer will receive a  stamped copy of the SF-122. If the request is disapproved, it will be  returned to the property management officer of the eligible institution  with an appropriate explanation. All USDA approved SF-122's will be  forwarded to DEPPC or the appropriate GSA office for final approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Once the excess personal property is physically received, the  institution is required to immediately return a copy of the SF-122 to  USDA indicating receipt of requested items. Cancellations should also be  reported to USDA.</p><p class="depth2">Note: USDA shall send an informational copy of all SF-122's  transactions to GSA.
