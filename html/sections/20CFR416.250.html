                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority and purpose. Section 1110(b) of the Act authorizes the  Commissioner to develop and conduct experimental, pilot, and  demonstration projects to promote the objectives or improve the  administration of the SSI program. These projects will test the  advantages of altering certain requirements, conditions, or limitations  for recipients and test different administrative methods that apply to  title XVI applicants and recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Altering benefit requirements, limitations or conditions.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Commissioner is  authorized to waive any of the requirements, limitations or conditions  established under title XVI of the Act and impose additional  requirements, limitations or conditions for the purpose of conducting  experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects. The projects will alter  the provisions that currently apply to applicants and recipients to test  their effect on the program. If, as a result of participation in a  project under this section, a project participant becomes ineligible for  Medicaid benefits, the Commissioner shall make arrangements to extend  Medicaid coverage to such participant and shall reimburse the States for  any additional expenses incurred due to such continued participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability and scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participants and nonparticipants.  If you are selected to participate in an experimental, pilot, or  demonstration project, we may temporarily set aside one or more current  requirements, limitations or conditions of eligibility and apply  alternative provisions to you. We may also modify current methods of  administering title XVI as part of a project and apply alternative  procedures or policies to you. The alternative provisions or methods of  administration used in the projects will not substantially reduce your  total income or resources as a result of your participation or  disadvantage you in comparison to current provisions, policies, or  procedures. If you are not selected to participate in the experimental,  or pilot, or demonstration projects (or if   you are placed in a control group which is not subject to the  alternative requirements, limitations, or conditions) we will continue  to apply the current requirements, limitations or conditions of  eligibility to you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative provisions or methods of administration. The  alternative requirements, limitations or conditions that apply to you in  an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project may include any of the  factors needed for aged, blind, or disabled persons to be eligible for  SSI benefits. Experiments that we conduct will include, to the extent  feasible, applicants and recipients who are under age 18 as well as  adults and will include projects to ascertain the feasibility of  treating drug addicts and alcoholics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Selection of participants. Participation in the SSI project will  be on a voluntary basis. The voluntary written consent necessary in  order to participate in any experimental, pilot, or demonstration  project may be revoked by the participant at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of experimental, pilot, and demonstration projects. A  notice describing each experimental, pilot, or demonstration project  will be published in the Federal Register before each project is placed  in operation. Each experimental, pilot and demonstration project will  have a termination date (up to 10 years from the start of the project).
