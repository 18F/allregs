                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cellulase enzyme preparation is derived from a nonpathogenic, nontoxicogenic strain of Trichoderma longibrachiatum (formerly T. reesei). The enzyme, cellulase, catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glycosidic linkages in cellulose. It is obtained from the culture filtrate resulting from a pure culture fermentation process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the general and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the monograph specifications on enzyme preparations in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 4th ed. (1996), pp. 129 to 134, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
