                            <p class="depth0">If the unit terminated before the unit operator met the initial  development obligations, BLM's approval of the unit agreement is  revoked. You, as lessee, forfeit all further benefits, including  extensions and suspensions, granted any NPR-A lease because of having  been committed to the unit. Any lease that the BLM extended because of  being committed to the unit would expire unless it had been granted an  extension or renewal under Sec. 3135.1-5 or Sec. 3135.1-6.
