                            <p class="depth0">The Director shall prepare quarterly, semi-annual, and annual  reports as detailed below. When the State is the permit-issuing  authority, the State Director shall submit all reports required under  this section to the Regional Administrator, and the EPA Region in turn  shall submit the State reports to EPA Headquarters. When EPA is the  permit-issuing authority, the Regional Administrator shall submit all  reports required under this section to EPA Headquarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Quarterly reports. The Director shall submit quarterly narrative  reports for major permittees as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Format. The report shall use the following format:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide a separate list of major NPDES permittees which shall be  subcategorized as non-POTWs, POTWs, and Federal permittees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alphabetize each list by permittee name. When two or more  permittees have the same name, the permittee with the lowest permit  number shall be entered first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each permittee on the list, include the following  information in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, location, and permit number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A brief description and date of each instance of noncompliance  for which paragraph (a)(2) of this section requires reporting. Each  listing shall indicate each specific provision of paragraph (a)(2)  (e.g., (ii)(A) thru (iii)(G)) which describes the reason for reporting  the violation on the quarterly report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date(s), and a brief description of the action(s) taken by  the Director to ensure compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The status of the instance(s) of noncompliance and the date  noncompliance was resolved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any details which tend to explain or mitigate the instance(s) of  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instances of noncompliance by major dischargers to be reported-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Instances of noncompliance, as defined in paragraphs  (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, by major dischargers shall be  reported in successive reports until the noncompliance is reported as  resolved (i.e., the permittee is no longer violating the permit  conditions reported as noncompliance in the QNCR). Once an instance of  noncompliance is reported as resolved in the QNCR, it need not appear in  subsequent reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All reported violations must be listed on the QNCR for the  reporting period when the violation occurred, even if the violation is  resolved during that reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All permittees under current enforcement orders (i.e.,  administrative and judicial orders and consent decrees) for previous  instances of noncompliance must be listed in the QNCR until the orders  have been satisfied in full and the permittee is in compliance with  permit conditions. If the permittee is in compliance with the  enforcement order, but has not achieved full compliance with permit  conditions, the compliance status shall be reported as ``resolved  pending,'' but the permittee will continue to be listed on the QNCR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Category I noncompliance. The following instances of  noncompliance by major dischargers are Category I noncompliance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Violations of conditions in enforcement orders except compliance  schedules and reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Violations of compliance schedule milestones for starting  construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by  90 days or more from the date of the milestone specified in an  enforcement order or a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Violations of permit effluent limits that exceed the Appendix A  ``Criteria for Noncompliance Reporting in the NPDES Program''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Failure to provide a compliance schedule report for final  compliance or a monitoring report. This applies when the permittee has  failed to submit a final compliance schedule progress report,  pretreatment report, or a Discharge Monitoring Report within 30 days  from the due date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Category II noncompliance. Category II noncompliance includes  violations of permit conditions which the Agency believes to be of  substantial concern and may not meet the Category I criteria. The  following are instances of noncompliance which must be reported as  Category II noncompliance unless the same violation meets the criteria  for Category I noncompliance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> (1) Violation of a permit limit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An unauthorized bypass;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An unpermitted discharge; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A pass-through of pollutants which causes or has the potential  to cause a water quality problem (e.g., fish kills, oil sheens) or  health problems (e.g., beach closings, fishing bans, or other  restrictions of beneficial uses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Failure of an approved POTW to implement its approved  pretreatment program adequately including failure to enforce industrial  pretreatment requirements on industrial users as required in the  approved program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Violations of any compliance schedule milestones (except those  milestones listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) by 90 days  or more from the date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> of this section) within 30  days from the due date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Instances when the required reports provided by the permittee  are so deficient or incomplete as to cause misunderstanding by the  Director and thus impede the review of the status of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Violations of narrative requirements (e.g., requirements to  develop Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and  requirements to implement Best Management Practices), which are of  substantial concern to the regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Any other violation or group of permit violations which the  Director or Regional Administrator considers to be of substantial  concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Semi-annual statistical summary report. Summary information  shall be provided twice a year on the number of major permittees with  two or more violations of the same monthly average permit limitation in  a six month period, including those otherwise reported under paragraph  (a) of this section. This report shall be submitted at the same time,  according to the Federal fiscal year calendar, as the first and third  quarter QNCRs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annual reports for NPDES--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual noncompliance report.  Statistical reports shall be submitted by the Director on nonmajor NPDES  permittees indicating the total number reviewed, the number of  noncomplying nonmajor permittees, the number of enforcement actions, and  number of permit modifications extending compliance deadlines. The  statistical information shall be organized to follow the types of  noncompliance listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A separate list of nonmajor discharges which are one or more  years behind in construction phases of the compliance schedule shall  also be submitted in alphabetical order by name and permit number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Schedule--(1) For all quarterly reports. On the last working day  of May, August, November, and February, the State Director shall submit  to the Regional Administrator information concerning noncompliance with  NPDES permit requirements by major dischargers in the State in acordance  with the following schedule. The Regional Administrator shall prepare  and submit information for EPA-issued permits to EPA Headquarters in  accordance with the same schedule:</p><p class="depth0">Quarters covered by reports on noncompliance by major dischargers:</p><p class="depth0">[Date for completion of reports]</p><p class="depth0">January, February, and March............  \1\ May 31</p><p class="depth0">April, May, and June....................  \1\ August 31</p><p class="depth0">July, August, and September.............  \1\ November 30</p><p class="depth0">October, November, and December.........  \1\ February 28</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Reports must be made available to the public for inspection and</p><p class="depth0">copying on this date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For all annual reports. The period for annual reports shall be  for the calendar year ending December 31, with reports completed and  available to the public no more than 60 days later.  Appendix A to Sec. 123.45--Criteria for Noncompliance Reporting in the</p><p class="depth0">NPDES Program</p><p class="depth0">This appendix describes the criteria for reporting violations of  NPDES permit effluent limits in the quarterly noncompliance report  (QNCR) as specified under Sec. 123.45(a)(2)(ii)(c). Any violation of an  NPDES permit is a violation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) for which the  permittee is liable. An agency's decision as to what enforcement action,  if any, should be taken in such cases, will be based on an analysis of  facts and legal requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Violations of Permit Effluent Limits</p><p class="depth0">Cases in which violations of permit effluent limits must be reported  depend upon the magnitude and/or frequency of the violation. Effluent  violations should be evaluated on a parameter-by-parameter and outfall- by-outfall basis. The criteria for reporting effluent violations are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Reporting Criteria for Violations of Monthly Average Permit Limits--</p><p class="depth0">Magnitude and Frequency</p><p class="depth0">Violations of monthly average effluent limits which exceed or equal  the product of the Technical Review Criteria (TRC) times the effluent  limit, and occur two months in a six month period must be reported. TRCs  are for two groups of pollutants.  Group I Pollutants--TRC=1.4 Group II Pollutants--TRC=1.2</p><p class="depth0">b. Reporting Criteria for Chronic Violations of Monthly Average Limits</p><p class="depth0">Chronic violations must be reported in the QNCR if the monthly  average permit limits are exceeded any four months in a six-month  period. These criteria apply to all Group I and Group II pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">Group I Pollutants--TRC=1.4</p><p class="depth0">Oxygen Demand  Biochemical Oxygen Demand Chemical Oxygen Demand Total Oxygen Demands Total Organic Carbon Other</p><p class="depth0">Solids  Total Suspended Solids (Residues) Total Dissolved Solids (Residues) Other</p><p class="depth0">Nutrients  Inorganic Phosphorus Compounds Inorganic Nitrogen Compounds Other</p><p class="depth0">Detergents and Oils  MBAS NTA Oil and Grease Other detergents or algicides</p><p class="depth0">Minerals  Calcium Chloride Fluoride Magnesium Sodium Potassium Sulfur Sulfate Total Alkalinity Total Hardness Other Minerals</p><p class="depth0">Metals  Aluminum Cobalt Iron Vanadium</p><p class="depth0">Group II Pollutants--TRC=1.2</p><p class="depth0">Metals (all forms)  Other metals not specifically listed under Group I</p><p class="depth0">Inorganic  Cyanide Total Residual Chlorine</p><p class="depth0">Organics</p><p class="depth0">All organics are Group II except those specifically listed under  Group I.
