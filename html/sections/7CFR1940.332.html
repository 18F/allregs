                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action requiring EIS. When an emergency circumstance makes it  necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact  without observing the provisions of this subpart or the CEQ regulations,  the Administrator will consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements  before the proposed action is taken. It must be recognized that CEQ's  regulations limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control the  immediate impacts of the emergency. Other actions remain subject to NEPA  review. For purposes of this subpart, an emergency circumstance is  defined as one involving an immediate or imminent danger to public  health or safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action not requiring EIS. When an emergency circumstance makes  it necessary to take an action with apparent non-significant  environmental impact without observing the provisions of this subpart or  the CEQ regulations, the Administrator will be so notified. The  Administrator reserves the authority to waive or amend all procedural  aspects of this subpart relating to the preparation of environmental  assessments including but not limited to the applicant's submission of  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-20,  public notice requirements and/or their associated comment periods, the  timing of the assessment process, and the content of environmental  review documents. Alternative arrangements will be established on a case  by case basis taking into account the nature of the emergency and the  time reasonably available to respond to it. These alternative  arrangements will, to the extent possible, attempt to achieve the  substantive requirements of this subpart such as avoiding impacts to  important land resources, when practicable, and minimizing potential  adverse environmental impacts. In all cases, the environmental findings  and determinations required for Class I and Class II assessments must be  executed by the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 officials prior to approval of the action and be based upon  the best information available under the circumstances and the  prescribed alternative arrangements.   (Refer to paragraph (a) of this section should the approval official for  the action determine that an EIS is necessary.) Additionally, all  applicable consultation and coordination procedures required by law or  regulation will be initiated with the appropriate Federal or State  agency(s). Such procedures will be accomplished in the most expeditious  manner possible and modified to the extent necessary and mutually  agreeable between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  and the affected agency(s). The provisions of this paragraph are limited  to the same emergency circumstances and scope of action as specified in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
