                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards set forth in this part which affect administration of Federal awards issued by Federal awarding agencies become effective once implemented by Federal awarding agencies or when any future amendment to this part becomes final. Federal awarding agencies must implement the policies and procedures applicable to Federal awards by promulgating a regulation to be effective by December 26, 2014 unless different provisions are required by statute or approved by OMB. For the procurement standards in Secs. 200.317-200.326, non-Federal entities may continue to comply with the procurement standards in previous OMB guidance (superseded by this part as described in Sec. 200.104) for one additional fiscal year after this part goes into effect. If a non-Federal entity chooses to use the previous procurement standards for an additional fiscal year before adopting the procurement standards in this part, the non-Federal entity must document this decision in their internal procurement policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The standards set forth in Subpart F--Audit Requirements of this part and any other standards which apply directly to Federal agencies will be effective December 26, 2013 and will apply to audits of fiscal years beginning on or after December 26, 2014.
