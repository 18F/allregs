                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Agency means an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5595(a)(1), except the  government of the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0">Commuting area means the geographic area surrounding a work site  that encompasses the localities where people live and reasonably can be  expected to travel back and forth daily to work, as established by the  employing agency based on the generally held expectations of the local  community. When an employee's residence is within the standard commuting  area for a work site, the work site is within the employee's commuting  area. When an employee's residence is outside the standard commuting  area for a proposed new work site, the employee's commuting area is  deemed to include the expanded area surrounding the employee's residence  and including all destinations that can be reached via a commuting trip  that is not significantly more burdensome than the current commuting   trip. This excludes a commuting trip from a residence where the employee  planned to stay only temporarily until he or she could find a more  permanent residence closer to his or her work site. For this purpose, a  commuting trip to a new work site is considered significantly more  burdensome if it would compel the employee to change his or her place of  residence in order to continue employment, taking into account commuting  time and distance, availability of public transportation, cost, and any  other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">Comparison rate has the meaning given that term in Sec. 536.103 of  this chapter, except paragraph (2) of that definition should be used for  the purpose of comparing grades or levels of work for all situations not  covered by paragraph (1) of that definition.</p><p class="depth0">Employed by the Government of the United States refers to employment  by any part of the Government of the United States, including the United  States Postal Service and similar independent entities, but excluding  enlistment or activation in the armed forces (as defined in 5 U.S.C.  2101).</p><p class="depth0">Employee (for the purpose of establishing initial entitlement to  severance pay upon separation) means an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C.  5595(a)(2), excluding an individual employed by the government of the  District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0">Note to definition of ``employee'': The term ``individual employed''  in 5 U.S.C. 5595(a)(2)(A) refers to an ``employee'' as defined in 5  U.S.C. 2105.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate annuity means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A recurring benefit payable under a retirement system applicable  to Federal civilian employees or members of the uniformed services that  the individual is eligible to receive (disregarding any offset described  in Sec. 550.704(b)(5)) at the time of the involuntary separation from  civilian service or that begins to accrue within 1 month after such  separation, excluding any Social Security retirement benefit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A benefit that meets the conditions in paragraph (a) of this  definition, except that the benefit begins to accrue more than 1 month  after separation solely because the employee elected a later commencing  date (such as allowed under Sec. 842.204 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">Inefficiency means unacceptable performance or conduct that leads to  a separation under part 432 or 752 of this chapter or an equivalent  procedure.</p><p class="depth0">Involuntary separation means a separation initiated by an agency  against the employee's will and without his or her consent for reasons  other than inefficiency, including a separation resulting from the  expiration of a time-limited appointment effected within 3 calendar days  after separation from a qualifying appointment. In addition, when an  employee is separated because he or she declines to accept reassignment  outside his or her commuting area, the separation is ``involuntary'' if  the employee's position description or other written agreement does not  provide for such a reassignment. However, an employee's separation is  not ``involuntary'' if, after such a written mobility agreement is  added, the employee accepts one reassignment outside his or her  commuting area, but subsequently declines another such reassignment.</p><p class="depth0">Nonqualifying appointment means an appointment that does not convey  eligibility for severance pay under this subpart, including--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An appointment at a noncovered agency;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An appointment in which the employee has an intermittent work  schedule;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Presidential appointment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An emergency appointment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An excepted appointment under Schedule C; a noncareer  appointment in the Senior Executive Service, as defined in 5 U.S.C.  3132(a); or an equivalent appointment made for similar purposes; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A time-limited appointment (except for a time-limited  appointment that is qualifying because it is made effective within 3  calendar days after separation from a qualifying appointment),  including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A term appointment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An overseas limited appointment with a time limitation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A limited term or limited emergency appointment in the Senior  Executive Service, as defined in 5 U.S.C.   3132(a), or an equivalent appointment made for similar purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A Veterans Recruitment Appointment under part 307 of this  chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A Presidential Management Fellows Program appointment under  Sec. 213.3402(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Qualifying appointment means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive  service or the equivalent in the excepted service;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A career appointment in the Senior Executive Service;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An excepted appointment without time limitation, except under  Schedule C or an equivalent appointment made for similar purposes;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An overseas limited appointment without time limitation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A status quo appointment, including one that becomes indefinite  when the employee is promoted, demoted, or reassigned;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A time-limited appointment in the Foreign Service, when the  employee was assigned under a statutory authority that carried  entitlement to reemployment in the same agency, but this right of  reemployment has expired; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A time-limited appointment (including a series of time-limited  appointments by the same agency without any intervening break in  service) for full-time employment that takes effect within 3 calendar  days after the end of one of the qualifying appointments listed in  paragraphs (a) through (f) of this definition, provided the time-limited  appointment is not nonqualifying on grounds other than the time-limited  nature of the appointment.</p><p class="depth2">Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or  administrative action for the position held by an employee, excluding  additional pay of any kind except the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; special  rate supplement under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; or similar payment or  supplement under other legal authority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual premium pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c) or availability pay  under 5 U.S.C. 5545a;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Straight-time pay for regular overtime hours for firefighters  under 5 U.S.C. 5545b (as provided in Sec. 550.1305(b)); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Night differential for prevailing rate employees under 5 U.S.C.  5343(f).</p><p class="depth0">Reasonable offer means the offer of a position that meets all the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The offer is in writing;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employee meets established qualification requirements; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The offered position is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the employee's agency, including an agency to which the  employee is transferred with his or her function in a transfer of  functions between agencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within the employee's commuting area, unless geographic mobility  is a condition of employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Of equal or greater tenure and with the same work schedule  (part-time or full-time); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not lower than two grade or pay levels below the employee's  current grade or pay level, without consideration of grade or pay  retention under part 536 of this chapter or other authority. In  movements between pay schedules or pay systems, the comparison rate of  the offered position must not be lower than the comparison rate of the  grade or pay level that is two grades below the grade of the current  position on the same pay schedule as the current position.</p><p class="depth3">Severance pay fund means the total severance pay to which an  employee is entitled during a single entitlement under 5 U.S.C. 5595. It  includes a basic severance pay allowance and, where applicable, an age  adjustment allowance, as computed under Sec. 550.707.
