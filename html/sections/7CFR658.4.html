                                Sec. 658.4  Guidelines for use of criteria.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As stated above and as provided in the Act, each Federal agency  shall use the criteria provided in Sec. 658.5 to identify and take into  account the adverse effects of Federal programs on the protection of  farmland. The agencies are to consider alternative actions, as  appropriate, that could lessen such adverse effects, and assure that  such Federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with  State, unit of local government and private programs and policies to  protect farmland. The following are guidelines to assist the agencies in  these tasks:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. NRCS will  respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except  that in cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is  needed, NRCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event that NRCS  fails to complete its response within the required period, if further  delay would interfere with construction activities, the agency should  proceed as though the site were not farmland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Form AD 1006, returned to the agency by NRCS will also  include the following incidental information: The total amount of  farmable land (the land in the unit of local government's jurisdiction  that is capable of producing the commonly grown crop); the percentage of  the jurisdiction that is farmland covered by the Act; the percentage of  farmland in the jurisdiction that the project would convert; and the  percentage of farmland in the local government's jurisdiction with the  same or higher relative value than the land that the project would  convert. These statistics will not be part of the criteria scoring  process, but are intended simply to furnish additional background  information to Federal agencies to aid them in considering the effects  of their projects on farmland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, the  agency will assign to the site a combined score of up to 260 points,  composed of up to 100 points for relative value and up to 160 points for  the site assessment. With this score the agency will be able to identify  the effect of its programs on farmland, and   make a determination as to the suitability of the site for protection as  farmland. Once this score is computed, USDA recommends:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sites with the highest combined scores be regarded as most  suitable for protection under these criteria and sites with the lowest  scores, as least suitable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sites receiving a total score of less than 160 need not be given  further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be  evaluated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more be given  increasingly higher levels of consideration for protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When making decisions on proposed actions for sites receiving  scores totaling 160 or more, agency personnel consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of land that is not farmland or use of existing structures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative sites, locations and designs that would serve the  proposed purpose but convert either fewer acres of farmland or other  farmland that has a lower relative value;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special siting requirements of the proposed project and the  extent to which an alternative site fails to satisfy the special siting  requirements as well as the originally selected site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal agencies may elect to assign the site assessment  criteria relative weightings other than those shown in Sec. 658.5 (b)  and (c). If an agency elects to do so, USDA recommends that the agency  adopt its alternative weighting system (1) through rulemaking in  consultation with USDA, and (2) as a system to be used uniformly  throughout the agency. USDA recommends that the weightings stated in  Sec. 658.5 (b) and (c) be used until an agency issues a final rule to  change the weightings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> It is advisable that evaluations and analyses of prospective  farmland conversion impacts be made early in the planning process before  a site or design is selected, and that, where possible, agencies make  the FPPA evaluations part of the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA) process. Under the agency's own NEPA regulations, some categories  of projects may be excluded from NEPA which may still be covered under  the FPPA. Section 1540(c)(4) of the Act exempts projects that were  beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design or  construction state on the effective date of the Act. Section 1547(b)  exempts acquisition or use of farmland for national defense purposes.  There are no other exemptions of projects by category in the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Numerous States and units of local government are developing and  adopting Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) systems to evaluate  the productivity of agricultural land and its suitability for conversion  to nonagricultural use. Therefore, States and units of local government  may have already performed an evaluation using criteria similar to those  contained in this rule applicable to Federal agencies. USDA recommends  that where sites are to be evaluated within a jurisdiction having a  State or local LESA system that has been approved by the governing body  of such jurisdiction and has been placed on the NRCS State  conservationist's list as one which meets the purpose of the FPPA in  balance with other public policy objectives, Federal agencies use that  system to make the evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To meet reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7  U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, after the agency has made  a final decision on a project in which one or more of the alternative  sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, the agency is requested to  return a copy of the Form AD-1006, which indicates the final decision of  the agency, to the NRCS field office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Once a Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA  for the conversion of a site, that agency's, or a second Federal  agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions  on the same site do not require additional redundant FPPA analysis.
