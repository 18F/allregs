                                Sec. 780.128  General statement on ``secondary'' agriculture.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The discussion in Sec. Sec. 780.106 through 780.127 relates to the direct farming operations which come within the ``primary'' meaning of the definition of ``agriculture.'' As defined in section 3(f) ``agriculture'' includes not only the farming activities described in the ``primary'' meaning but also includes,

in its ``secondary'' meaning, ``any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.'' The legislative history makes it plain that this language was particularly included to make certain that independent contractors such as threshers of wheat, who travel around from farm to farm to assist farmers in what is recognized as a purely agricultural task and also to assist a farmer in getting his agricultural goods to market in their raw or natural state, should be included within the definition of agricultural employees (see Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11; 81 Cong. Rec. 7876, 7888).</p>
