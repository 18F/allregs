                            <p class="depth0">The exemption in section 13(a)(13) of the Act need not be considered  unless the employee is ``engaged in commerce or the production of goods  for commerce'' or is employed in an ``enterprise engaged in commerce or  in the production of goods for commerce,'' as those words are defined in  the Act, so as to come within the general scope of sections 6 and 7. The  principles of coverage are discussed in part 776 of this chapter and the  discussion will not be repeated in this part. Neither does this part  discuss the exemptions provided in section 13(a)(6) and 13(b)(12), or  section 3(f) which includes in the definition of agriculture forestry or  lumbering operations performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident  to or in conjunction with certain farming operations.
