At his discretion the Secretary, the Under Secretary, or any Assistant Secretary of the Treasury acting by direction of the Secretary, is authorized to waive any such regulation on behalf of the Commissioner in any particular case where a similar regulation of the Treasury Department with respect to United States bonds or interest thereon would be waived.</p>
