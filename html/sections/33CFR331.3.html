                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the division engineer may not delegate any authority  or responsibility described in this part as that of the division  engineer. For approved JDs only, the division engineer may delegate any  authority or responsibility described in this part as that of the  division engineer, including the final appeal decision. In such cases,  any delegated authority must be granted to an official that is at the  same or higher grade level than the grade level of the official that  signed the approved JD. Regardless of any delegation of authority or  responsibility for ROs or for final appeal decisions for approved JDs,  the division engineer retains overall responsibility for the  administrative appeal process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The RO will assist the division engineer in reaching and  documenting the division engineer's decision on the merits of an appeal,  if the division engineer has delegated this responsibility as explained  in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The division engineer has the  authority to make the final decision on the merits of the appeal.  Neither the RO nor the division engineer has the authority to make a  final decision to issue or deny any particular permit nor to make an  approved JD, pursuant to the administrative appeal process established  by this part. The authority to issue or deny permits remains with the  district engineer. However, the division engineer may exercise the  authority at 33 CFR 325.8(c) to elevate any permit application, and  subsequently make the final permit decision. In such a case, any appeal  process of the district engineer's initial decision is terminated. If a  particular permit application is elevated to the division engineer  pursuant to 33 CFR 325.8(c), and the division engineer's decision on the  permit application is a permit denial or results in a declined permit,  that permit denial or declined permit would be subject to an  administrative appeal to the Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Qualifications. The RO will be a Corps employee with extensive  knowledge of the Corps regulatory program. Where the permit decision  being appealed was made by the division engineer or higher authority, a  Corps official at least one level higher than the decision maker shall  make the decision on the merits of the RFA, and this   Corps official shall appoint a qualified individual as the RO to conduct  the appeal process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Independence. The RO will not perform, or have been  involved with, the preparation, review, or decision making of the action  being appealed. The RO will be independent and impartial in reviewing  any appeal, and when assisting the division engineer to make a decision  on the merits of the appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review. The RO will conduct an independent review of the  administrative record to address the reasons for the appeal cited by the  applicant in the RFA. In addition, to the extent that it is practicable  and feasible, the RO will also conduct an independent review of the  administrative record to verify that the record provides an adequate and  reasonable basis supporting the district engineer's decision, that facts  or analysis essential to the district engineer's decision have not been  omitted from the administrative record, and that all relevant  requirements of law, regulations, and officially promulgated Corps  policy guidance have been satisfied. Should the RO require expert advice  regarding any subject, he may seek such advice from any employee of the  Corps or of another Federal or state agency, or from any recognized  expert, so long as that person had not been previously involved in the  action under review.</p>
