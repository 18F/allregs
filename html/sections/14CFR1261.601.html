                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coverage. This subpart applies to agencies and employees as  defined in Sec. 1261.602.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This subpart and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in  recovering certain prejudgment debts by administrative offset except  where the employee consents to the recovery, from the current pay  account of an employee. Because it   is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary  offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart should  be consistent with subpart 1261.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excluded debts or claims. The procedures contained in this  subpart do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Social  Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), or the tariff laws of the United  States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is  explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel  advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705, employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108,  and debts determined by a court as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514 note).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office.  This subpart does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of a  salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C.  716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by  submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in  accordance with procedures prescribed by the General Accounting Office.  Similarly, in the case of other types of debts, it does not preclude an  employee from requesting waiver, if waiver is available under any  statutory provision pertaining to the particular debt being collected.</p>
