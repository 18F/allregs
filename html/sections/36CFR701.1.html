For information about access to, service of, and employment with the Library of Congress, go to http://www.loc.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public Affairs Office. The Public Affairs Office shall have the principal responsibility for responding to requests for information about the Library from representatives of the media; giving advice to Library officers and staff members on public-relations and public-information matters; keeping the Librarian and other officers informed of important developments in this field; and promoting the resources and activities of the Library.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During regular office hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) telephone operators shall refer requests for information, from the media only, about the Library to the Public Affairs Office.
