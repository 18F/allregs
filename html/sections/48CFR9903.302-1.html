                            <p class="depth0">Cost accounting practice, as used in this part, means any disclosed  or established accounting method or technique which is used for  allocation of cost to cost objectives, assignment of cost to cost  accounting periods, or measurement of cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Measurement of cost, as used in this part, encompasses  accounting methods and techniques used in defining the components of  cost, determining the basis for cost measurement, and establishing  criteria for use of alternative cost measurement techniques. The  determination of the amount paid or a change in the amount paid for a  unit of goods and services is not a cost accounting practice. Examples  of cost accounting practices which involve measurement of costs are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of either historical cost, market value, or present  value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of standard cost or actual cost; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The designation of those items of cost which must be included or  excluded from tangible capital assets or pension cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assignment of cost to cost accounting periods, as used in this  part, refers   to a method or technique used in determining the amount of cost to be  assigned to individual cost accounting periods. Examples of cost  accounting practices which involve the assignment of cost to cost  accounting periods are requirements for the use of specified accrual  basis accounting or cash basis accounting for a cost element.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of cost to cost objectives, as used in this part,  includes both direct and indirect allocation of cost. Examples of cost  accounting practices involving allocation of cost to cost objectives are  the accounting methods or techniques used to accumulate cost, to  determine whether a cost is to be directly or indirectly allocated to  determine the composition of cost pools, and to determine the selection  and composition of the appropriate allocation base.</p>
