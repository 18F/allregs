                                Sec. 160.110  Most favored lender usury preemption for all savings
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. The term ``interest'' as used in 12 U.S.C. 1463(g)  includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for  an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any  default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was  extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected  with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late  fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash  advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include  appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance  guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees  for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain  credit reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority. A savings association located in a state may charge  interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or  licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law  permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a  Federal savings association making such loans is subject only to the  provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are  material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a  Federal savings association may lawfully charge the highest rate  permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without  being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of  loans made by small loan companies. State supervisors determine the  degree to which state-chartered savings associations must comply with  state laws other than those imposing restrictions on interest, as  defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect on state definitions of interest. The Federal definition  of the term ``interest'' in paragraph (a) of this section does not  change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the  state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law.  For example, if late fees are not ``interest'' under state law where a  savings association is located but state law permits its most favored  lender to charge late fees, then a savings association located in that  state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The savings  association may also charge late fees to its interstate customers  because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest  and an allowable charge under state law where the savings association is  located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for  purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because  state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that  lending institutions may charge under those limitations.</p>
