                                Sec. 277.11  Financial reporting requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes requirements for the State  agencies to report financial information to FNS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorized forms and instructions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only forms specified by  this part, or other forms authorized by FNS, may be used for obtaining  financial information from State agencies for the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All instructions for use in connection with the form specified  in Sec. 277.11(c) shall be followed. FNS may prescribe supplementary  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State agencies shall submit the original and two copies of forms  required by this section unless FNS approves a waiver of this  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The forms and instructions in this part shall be available to  the State agency and to the public upon request to FNS Regional Offices  as set out in Sec. 271.6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial status report--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. State agencies shall use the  standard Financial Status Report (Form SF-269) to report program costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frequency. The report (Form SF-269) shall be required quarterly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions. Those State agencies that receive payments under the  U.S. Treasury check system shall submit to FNS a Quarterly Report of  Federal Cash Transactions (Form SF-272).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Due dates. Quarterly reports shall be due April 30 (for the  period January through March), July 30 (April through June), October 30  (July through September), January 30 (October through December). Final  reports are due December 30 for all completed Federal fiscal years  (October 1 through September 30) or 90 days after termination of Federal  financial support. Requests from State agencies for extension of  reporting due dates may be approved, if necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time limit for State agencies to file claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the  deadline in paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the final SF-269  report, State agencies shall use the form specified by FNS as needed  within three years of the end of the Federal fiscal year to amend a  prior expenditure report pertaining to such   Federal fiscal year. The three-year reporting deadline may be extended  by FNS if litigation, an audit, or a claim is unresolved at the end of  the three-year period. The reporting form shall be used to amend prior  expenditure reports, and to request reimbursement for any additional  funding due, or to pay back to FNS any inadvertent prior overclaim.  Requests for reimbursement will only be honored if the claim is filed  within the timeframe in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. FNS reserves  the right to bill State agencies for amounts due FNS resulting from an  overclaim, even if no reporting form has been submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to the availability of funds from the appropriation for  the year in which the expenditure was incurred, FNS may reimburse State  agencies for an allowable expenditure only if the State agency files a  claim with FNS for that expenditure within two years after the calendar  quarter in which the State agency (or local agency) incurred the cost.  FNS will consider non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have  been made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting  records of the State agency in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Automated Data Processing (ADP) expenditures approved under  Sec. 277.18(c), subject to the availability of funds and required FNS  approval related to the Advance Planning Document, FNS may reimburse  State agencies for allowable expenditures at the appropriate rate in  effect at the time the equipment or service was received only if the  State agency files for a claim with FNS within two years after the  calendar quarter in which the cost was incurred. FNS will consider non- cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the quarter  the expenditure was recorded in the accounting records of the State  agency in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> States wishing to request an extension of the deadline in  paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section must submit the request in  writing to FNS prior to the applicable deadline. The State agency's  request for an extension must include a specific explanation,  justification, and documentation of why the claim will be late and when  the claim will be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The time limits in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section  will not apply to any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any claim for an adjustment to prior year costs previously  claimed under an interim rate concept;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any claim arising from an audit exception as defined in this  section. An audit exception means a proposed adjustment by the  Department to any expenditure claimed by a State agency by virtue of a  Federal-or State-initiated audit. The audit must comply with the  requirements of Sec. 277.17 and 7 CFR part 3015, and must have been  started within 3 years of the date of submission of the final SF-269 of  the relevant Federal fiscal year to which it applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any claim resulting from a court-ordered retroactive payment.  However, this provision does not bind FNS to a State or Federal court  decision when FNS was not a party to the action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any claim for which FNS determines there was good cause for the  State agency's not filing it within the time limit. Good cause is  lateness due to circumstances beyond the State agency's control such as  Acts of God or documented action or inaction of the Federal Government.  It does not include neglect or administrative inadequacy on the part of  the State, State agency, legislature, or any of their offices or  employees.
