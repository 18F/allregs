                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Public Law 99-509, the Rural Housing Service (RHS) sold certain of the portfolio of loans made under section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949 to the Rural Housing Trust, 1987-1. The sale was without recourse to RHS except for certain provisions providing for RHS's payment of interest credit amounts and agreement to compensate the Rural Housing Trust 1987-1 for future cash flow changes due to revised borrowers rights as set forth in RHS regulations. The sale documents to Rural Housing Trust 1987-1 recognize that the RHS loans were assigned subject to rights provided to these borrowers under documentation to recognize the rights of RHS borrowers under regulations of RHS as they may exist from time to time and to service the loans in accordance with then current RHS regulations. In addition, as provided in Sec.  1957.6 of this subpart, RHS has retained review, but not hearing authority under the RHS Appeal Procedure, 7 CFR part 1900, Subpart B. Failure of private servicers to comply with RHS regulations in servicing loans sold to the Rural Housing Trust 1987-1 may be redressed in the review process under the Appeal Procedure.</p>
