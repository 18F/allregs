                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for issuance. A suspending official may issue a final  suspension order with respect to a respondent proposed for suspension  if, based solely on the written record, the suspending official  determines that there is adequate evidence that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulated entity is engaging or has engaged in a covered  transaction within the past three (3) years with the respondent, and the  respondent engaged in covered misconduct; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The covered misconduct is of a type that would be likely to  cause significant financial or reputational harm to a regulated entity  or otherwise threaten the safe and sound operation of a regulated  entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written record. The written record shall include any material  submitted by the respondent and any material submitted by the regulated  entities, as well as any other material that was considered by the  suspending official in making the final determination, including any  information related to the factors in paragraph (c) of this section.  FHFA may independently obtain information relevant to the suspension  determination for inclusion in the written record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Factors that may be considered by the suspending official. In  determining whether or not to issue a final suspension order with  respect to the respondent where the grounds for suspension are  satisfied, the suspending official may also consider any factors that  the suspending official determines may be relevant in light of the  circumstances of the particular case, including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may  result from the covered misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The frequency of incidents or duration of the covered  misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether there is a pattern of prior covered misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether and to what extent the respondent planned, initiated, or  carried out the covered misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the  covered misconduct and recognizes its seriousness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the respondent has paid or agreed to pay all criminal,  civil and administrative penalties or liabilities for the covered  misconduct, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred  by the government, and has made or agreed to make full restitution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Whether the covered misconduct was pervasive within the  respondent's organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the  covered misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Whether the respondent's organization took appropriate  corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics  training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence of the covered  misconduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Whether the respondent brought the covered misconduct to the  attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Whether the respondent has fully investigated the circumstances  surrounding the covered misconduct and, if so, made the result of the  investigation available to the suspending official;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Whether the respondent had effective standards of conduct and  internal control systems in place at the time the covered misconduct  occurred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Whether the respondent has taken appropriate disciplinary  action against the individuals responsible for the covered misconduct;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Whether the respondent has had adequate time to eliminate the  circumstances within the organization that led to the covered  misconduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deadline for decision. The suspending official shall make a  determination on whether to issue a final suspension order with respect  to the respondent within thirty (30) calendar days of the deadline given  for the respondent's response in the notice of proposed suspension,  unless the suspending official notifies the respondent in writing that  additional time is needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination not to issue final suspension order. If the  suspending official determines that suspension is not appropriate with  respect to the respondent, the suspending official shall provide prompt  written notice of that determination to the respondent, the regulated  entity, and all of the other regulated entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Issuance of final suspension order--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If the  suspending official makes a final determination to suspend the  respondent, the suspending official shall issue a final suspension order  to each regulated entity regarding the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content of final suspension order. A final suspension order  shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the suspension determination and supporting  grounds, including a discussion of any relevant information submitted by  the respondent or regulated entities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of each person and any affiliates thereof to  which the suspension applies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the scope of the suspension, including the  time period to which the suspension applies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of any limitations or qualifications that apply  to the scope of the suspension, including modification of the conduct of  covered transactions that may be engaged in with the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice to respondent required. The suspending official shall  provide prompt written notice to the respondent of the final suspension  order issued   to the regulated entities with respect to such respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Content of notice. The notice of a final suspension order shall  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the suspension determination and supporting  grounds, including a discussion of any relevant information submitted by  the respondent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the final suspension order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. A final suspension order shall take effect on  the date specified in the order, which shall be at least forty-five (45)  calendar days after the date on which the order is signed by the  suspending official.</p>
