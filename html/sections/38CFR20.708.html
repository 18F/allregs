                            <p class="depth0">An appellant's authorized representative may request a prehearing conference with the presiding Member of a hearing to clarify the issues to be considered at a hearing on appeal, obtain rulings on the admissibility of evidence, develop stipulations of fact, establish the length of argument which will be permitted, or take other steps which will make the hearing itself more efficient and productive. With respect to hearings to be held before the Board at Washington, DC, arrangements for a prehearing conference must be made through: Director, Management and Administration (01E), Board of Veterans' Appeals, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. Requests for prehearing conferences in cases involving hearings to be held before the Board at Department of Veterans Affairs field facilities must be addressed to the office of the Department of Veterans Affairs official who signed the letter giving notice of the time and place of the hearing.
