                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specification of permanent sanction. If, at the time an initial  decision is issued, a temporary sanction is in effect as to any  respondent, the initial decision shall specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which terms or conditions of a temporary cease-and-desist order,  if any, shall become permanent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether a temporary suspension of a respondent's registration,  if any, shall be made a permanent revocation of registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modification of temporary order. If any temporary sanction shall  not become permanent under the terms of the initial decision, the  hearing officer shall issue a separate order setting aside, limiting or  suspending the temporary sanction then in effect in accordance with the  terms of the initial decision. The hearing officer shall decline to  suspend a term or condition of a temporary cease-and-desist order if it   is found that the continued effectiveness of such term or condition is  necessary to effectuate any term of the relief ordered in the initial  decision, including the payment of disgorgement, interest or penalties.  An order modifying temporary sanctions shall be effective 14 days after  service. Within one week of service of the order modifying temporary  sanctions any party may seek a stay or modification of the order from  the Commission pursuant to Sec. 201.401.</p>
