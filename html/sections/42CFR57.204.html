                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual payment. The Secretary will make payments to each school  with which he or she has entered into an agreement under the Act at a  time determined by him or her. If the total of the amounts requested for  any fiscal year by all schools for Federal capital contributions exceeds  the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of  payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school  will be reduced to whichever is smaller:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount requested in the application, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of  Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be  available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan  Program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary  to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of  full-time students in all participating schools during that year.  Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in  accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications  requested more than the amount paid to them, but with whatever  adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any  school from exceeding the total requested by it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of payment. The payment of Federal capital contributions  to a school will be paid in a manner that avoids unnecessary  accumulations of money in any health professions student loan fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary. All funds from  a student loan fund established under this subpart which are remitted to  the Secretary in any fiscal year shall be available for allotment under  this subpart, in the same fiscal year and the succeeding fiscal year, to  schools which, during the period beginning on July 1, 1972, and ending  on September 30, 1985, established student loan funds with Federal  capital contributions under this subpart. The Secretary will from time  to time set dates by which the schools must file applications to receive  a portion of these funds. If the total of the amounts requested for any  fiscal year by eligible schools exceeds the amount of funds determined  by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this  purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is  smaller:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount requested in the application, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of  returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be  available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan  program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary  to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of  full-time students in all eligible schools during that year.  Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in  accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications  requested more than the amount paid to them, with whatever adjustments  may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding  the total requested by it.
