                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If at the time the taxpayer paid or incurred  expenditures for the purpose of soil or water conservation, or for the  prevention of erosion of land, it was reasonable to believe that such  expenditures would directly and substantially benefit land of the  taxpayer which does not qualify as ``land used in farming,'' as defined  in Sec. 1.175-4, as well as land of the taxpayer which does so qualify,  then, for purposes of section 175, only a part of the taxpayer's total  expenditures is in respect of ``land used in farming.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of allocation. The part of expenditures allocable to  ``land used in farming'' generally equals the amount which bears the  same proportion to the total amount of such expenditures as the area of  land of the taxpayer used in farming which it was reasonable to believe  would be directly and substantially benefited as a result of the  expenditures bears to the total area of land of the taxpayer which it  was reasonable to believe would be so benefited. If it is established by  clear and convincing evidence that, in the light   of all the facts and circumstances, another method of allocation is more  reasonable than the method provided in the preceding sentence, the  taxpayer may allocate the expenditures under that other method. For  purposes of this section, the term land of the taxpayer means land with  respect to which the taxpayer has title, leasehold, or some other  substantial interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A owns a 200-acre tract of land, 80 acres of which  qualify as ``land used in farming.'' A makes expenditures for the  purpose of soil and water conservation which can reasonably be expected  to directly and substantially benefit the entire 200-acre tract. In the  absence of clear and convincing evidence that a different allocation is  more reasonable, A may deduct 40 percent (80/200) of such expenditures  under section 175. The same result would obtain if A had made the  expenditures after newly acquiring the tract from a person who had used  80 of the 200 acres in farming immediately prior to A's acquisition.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A's  expenditures for the purpose of soil and water conservation can  reasonably be expected to directly and substantially benefit only the 80  acres which qualify as land used in farming; any benefit to the other  120 acres would be minor and incidental. A may deduct all of such  expenditures under section 175.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A's  expenditures for the purpose of soil and water conservation can  reasonably be expected to directly and substantially benefit only the  120 acres which do not qualify as land used in farming. A may not deduct  any of such expenditures under section 175. The same result would obtain  even if A had leased the 200-acre tract to B in the expectation that B  would farm the entire tract.
