                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Lifetime limits. Except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, a group health plan, or a health  insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage,  may not establish any lifetime limit on the dollar amount of benefits  for any individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual limits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as provided in  paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (b), and (d) of this section, a group health  plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health  insurance coverage, may not establish any annual limit on the dollar  amount of benefits for any individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for health flexible spending arrangements. A health  flexible spending arrangement (as defined in section 106(c)(2) of the  Internal Revenue Code) is not subject to the requirement in paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Construction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Permissible limits on specific covered  benefits. The rules of this section do not prevent a group health plan,  or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health  insurance coverage, from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with  respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not  essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise  permitted under applicable Federal or State law. (The scope of essential  health benefits is addressed in paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Condition-based exclusions. The rules of this section do not  prevent a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group  or individual health insurance coverage, from excluding all benefits for  a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then  the requirements of this section apply. Other requirements of Federal or  State law may require coverage of certain benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of essential health benefits. The term ``essential  health benefits'' means essential health benefits under section 1302(b)  of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and applicable  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Restricted annual limits permissible prior to 2014--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. With respect to plan years (in the individual market, policy  years) beginning prior to January 1, 2014, a group health plan, or a  health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance  coverage, may establish, for any individual, an annual limit on the  dollar amount of benefits that are essential health benefits, provided  the limit is no less than the amounts in the following schedule:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a plan year (in the individual market, policy year)  beginning on or after September 23, 2010, but before September 23, 2011,  $750,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a plan year (in the individual market, policy year)  beginning on or after September 23, 2011, but before September 23, 2012,  $1,250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For plan years (in the individual market, policy years)  beginning on or   after September 23, 2012, but before January 1, 2014, $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Only essential health benefits taken into account. In  determining whether an individual has received benefits that meet or  exceed the applicable amount described in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, a plan or issuer must take into account only essential health  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver authority of the Secretary. For plan years (in the  individual market, policy years) beginning before January 1, 2014, the  Secretary may establish a program under which the requirements of  paragraph (d)(1) of this section relating to annual limits may be waived  (for such period as is specified by the Secretary) for a group health  plan or health insurance coverage that has an annual dollar limit on  benefits below the restricted annual limits provided under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section if compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this  section would result in a significant decrease in access to benefits  under the plan or health insurance coverage or would significantly  increase premiums for the plan or health insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transitional rules for individuals whose coverage or benefits  ended by reason of reaching a lifetime limit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The relief  provided in the transitional rules of this paragraph (e) applies with  respect to any individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whose coverage or benefits under a group health plan or group or  individual health insurance coverage ended by reason of reaching a  lifetime limit on the dollar value of all benefits for any individual  (which, under this section, is no longer permissible); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Who becomes eligible (or is required to become eligible) for  benefits not subject to a lifetime limit on the dollar value of all  benefits under the group health plan or group or individual health  insurance coverage on the first day of the first plan year (in the  individual market, policy year) beginning on or after September 23,  2010, by reason of the application of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> must be  provided beginning not later than the first day of the first plan year  (in the individual market, policy year) beginning on or after September  23, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The notices required under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section  may be provided to an employee on behalf of the employee's dependent (in  the individual market, to the primary subscriber on behalf of the  primary subscriber's dependent). In addition, for a group health plan or  group health insurance coverage, the notices may be included with other  enrollment materials that a plan distributes to employees, provided the  statement is prominent. For either notice, with respect to a group  health plan or group health insurance coverage, if a notice satisfying  the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) is provided to an individual,  the obligation to provide the notice with respect to that individual is  satisfied for both the plan and the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date of coverage. In the case of an individual who  enrolls under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, coverage must take  effect not later than the first day of the first plan year (in the  individual market, policy year) beginning on or after September 23,  2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of enrollees in a group health plan. Any individual  enrolling in a group health plan pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this  section must be treated as if the individual were a special enrollee, as  provided under the   rules of Sec. 146.117(d). Accordingly, the individual (and, if the  individual would not be a participant once enrolled in the plan, the  participant through whom the individual is otherwise eligible for  coverage under the plan) must be offered all the benefit packages  available to similarly situated individuals who did not lose coverage by  reason of reaching a lifetime limit on the dollar value of all benefits.  For this purpose, any difference in benefits or cost-sharing  requirements constitutes a different benefit package. The individual  also cannot be required to pay more for coverage than similarly situated  individuals who did not lose coverage by reason of reaching a lifetime  limit on the dollar value of all benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Y maintains a group health plan with  a calendar year plan year. The plan has a single benefit package. For  plan years beginning before September 23, 2010, the plan has a lifetime  limit on the dollar value of all benefits. Individual B, an employee of  Y, was enrolled in Y's group health plan at the beginning of the 2008  plan year. On June 10, 2008, B incurred a claim for benefits that  exceeded the lifetime limit under Y's plan and ceased to be enrolled in  the plan. B is still eligible for coverage under Y's group health plan.  On or before January 1, 2011, Y's group health plan gives B written  notice informing B that the lifetime limit on the dollar value of all  benefits no longer applies, that individuals whose coverage ended by  reason of reaching a lifetime limit under the plan are eligible to  enroll in the plan, and that individuals can request such enrollment  through February 1, 2011 with enrollment effective retroactively to  January 1, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan has complied with the  requirements of this paragraph (e) by providing a timely written notice  and enrollment opportunity to B that lasts at least 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Z maintains a group health plan with  a plan year beginning October 1 and ending September 30. Prior to  October 1, 2010, the group health plan has a lifetime limit on the  dollar value of all benefits. Individual D, an employee of Z, and  Individual E, D's child, were enrolled in family coverage under Z's  group health plan for the plan year beginning on October 1, 2008. On May  1, 2009, E incurred a claim for benefits that exceeded the lifetime  limit under Z's plan. D dropped family coverage but remains an employee  of Z and is still eligible for coverage under Z's group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, not later than October 1, 2010,  the plan must provide D and E an opportunity to enroll (including  written notice of an opportunity to enroll) that continues for at least  30 days, with enrollment effective not later than October 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 2, except that Z's plan  had two benefit packages (a low-cost and a high-cost option). Instead of  dropping coverage, D switched to the low-cost benefit package option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, not later than October 1, 2010,  the plan must provide D and E an opportunity to enroll in any benefit  package available to similarly situated individuals who enroll when  first eligible. The plan would have to provide D and E the opportunity  to enroll in any benefit package available to similarly situated  individuals who enroll when first eligible, even if D had not switched  to the low-cost benefit package option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Q maintains a group health plan with  a plan year beginning October 1 and ending September 30. For the plan  year beginning on October 1, 2009, Q has an annual limit on the dollar  value of all benefits of $500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, Q must raise the annual limit on  the dollar value of essential health benefits to at least $750,000 for  the plan year beginning October 1, 2010. For the plan year beginning  October 1, 2011, Q must raise the annual limit to at least $1.25  million. For the plan year beginning October 1, 2012, Q must raise the  annual limit to at least $2 million. Q may also impose a restricted  annual limit of $2 million for the plan year beginning October 1, 2013.  After the conclusion of that plan year, Q cannot impose an overall  annual limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except that the  annual limit for the plan year beginning on October 1, 2009, is $1  million and Q lowers the annual limit for the plan year beginning  October 1, 2010 to $750,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, Q complies with the requirements  of this paragraph (e). However, Q's choice to lower its annual limit  means that under Sec. 147.140(g)(1)(vi)(C), the group health plan will  cease to be a grandfathered health plan and will be generally subject to  all of the provisions of PHS Act sections 2701 through 2719A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For a policy year that began on October 1,  2009, Individual T has individual health insurance coverage with a  lifetime limit on the dollar value of all benefits of $1 million. For  the policy year beginning October 1, 2010, the issuer of T's health  insurance coverage eliminates the lifetime limit and replaces it with an  annual limit of   $1 million dollars. In the policy year beginning October 1, 2011, the  issuer of T's health insurance coverage maintains the annual limit of $1  million dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, the issuer's replacement of a  lifetime limit with an equal dollar annual limit allows it to maintain  status as a grandfathered health policy under Sec.  147.140(g)(1)(vi)(B). Since grandfathered health plans that are  individual health insurance coverage are not subject to the requirements  of this section relating to annual limits, the issuer does not have to  comply with this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Applicability date. The provisions of this section apply for  plan years (in the individual market, for policy years) beginning on or  after September 23, 2010. See Sec. 147.140 of this part for determining  the application of this section to grandfathered health plans (providing  that the prohibitions on lifetime and annual limits apply to all  grandfathered health plans that are group health plans and group health  insurance coverage, including the special rules regarding restricted  annual limits, and the prohibition on lifetime limits apply to  individual health insurance coverage that is a grandfathered health plan  but the rules on annual limits do not apply to individual health  insurance coverage that is a grandfathered health plan).
