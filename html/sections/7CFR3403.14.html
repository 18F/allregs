                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Delegation of fiscal responsibility. Unless the terms and  conditions of the grant state otherwise, the grantee may not in whole or  in part delegate or transfer to another person, institution, or  organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Changes in Project Plans. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The permissible changes by the  grantee, Project Director, or other key project personnel in the  approved project grant shall be limited to changes in methodology,  techniques, or other similar aspects of the project to expedite  achievement of the project's approved goals. If the grantee or the  Project Director (PD) is uncertain as to whether a change complies with  this provision, the question must be referred to the Authorized  Departmental Officer (ADO) for a final determination. The signatory of  the award document is the ADO, not the program contact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changes in approved goals or objectives shall be requested by  the grantee and, in consultation with the NIFA SBIR National Program  Leader,   approved in writing by the ADO prior to effecting such changes. In no  event shall requests for such changes be approved which are outside the  scope of the original approved project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or  reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the  grantee and, in consultation with the NIFA SBIR National Program Leader,  approved in writing by the ADO prior to effecting such changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic  work in whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or  not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and,  in consultation with the NIFA SBIR National Program Leader, approved in  writing by the ADO prior to effecting such transfers, unless prescribed  otherwise in the terms and conditions of the grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes in Project Period. The project period may be extended by  NIFA without additional financial support, for such additional period(s)  as the ADO determines may be necessary to complete or fulfill the  purposes of an approved project provided Federal funds remain. Any  extension of time shall be conditioned upon prior request by the grantee  and approval in writing by the ADO unless otherwise noted in the award  terms and conditions. In such cases the extension will not normally  exceed 12 months. The Phase I award will still be limited to the  approved award amount, and the submission of a Phase II proposal will  normally be delayed by no more than one year. The extension allows the  grantee to continue expending the remaining Federal funds for the  intended purpose over the extension period. In instances where no  Federal funds remain, it is unnecessary to approve an extension since  the purpose of the extension is to continue using Federal funds. The  grantee may opt to continue the Phase I project after the grant's  termination and closeout, however, the grantee would have to do so  without additional Federal funds. In the latter case, no communication  with USDA is necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in approved budget. Changes in an approved budget must  be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the ADO prior to  instituting such changes if the revision will involve transfers or  expenditures of amounts requiring prior approval as set forth in the  applicable Federal cost principles, Departmental regulations, or grant  award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Use of Change of Name and Novation Agreement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Occasionally,  after an award has been made the name of the Awardee may change. NIFA  requires execution of a ``Change of Name Agreement'' in such instances.  The specific circumstances of each situation will determine which kind  of agreement should be executed. This decision will be determined by the  ADO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Change of Name Agreement is a legal instrument executed by the  Awardee and the Government that recognizes a change of the legal name of  the Awardee without disturbing the original rights and obligations of  the parties. If only a change of the Awardee's name is involved and the  Government's and Awardee's rights and obligations remain unaffected, the  parties should execute an agreement to reflect the name change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In order to execute the actual Change of Name Agreement with  USDA, the Awardee is required to submit the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The document effecting the name change, authenticated by a  proper official of the State having jurisdiction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The opinion of the Grantee's legal counsel stating that the  change of name was properly effected under applicable law and showing  the effective date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A list of all affected awards between the Grantee and NIFA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When NIFA is notified that a change of name has taken place,  the ADO will request the aforementioned information from the Grantee.  Upon receipt and review of this information, parties will properly  execute a Change of Name Agreement and the appropriate changes will be  made to the Agency's records. The following suggested format for an  agreement may be adapted for specific cases:</p><p class="depth0">CHANGE OF NAME AGREEMENT</p><p class="depth0">THE ABC CORPORATION (Grantee), a corporation duly organized and  existing under the laws of ------------ (insert State), and theNATIONAL  INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND   AGRICULTURE, USDA (Government) enter into this Agreement as of -------- ---- (insert date when the change of name became effective under  applicable State law).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTS:</p><p class="depth0">1. The Government, represented by the ADO, has entered into certain  awards with XYZ CORPORATION, namely ------------ (insert award number or  delete ``namely'' and insert ``as shown in the attached list marked  `Exhibit A' and incorporated in this Agreement by reference.'') The term  ``the awards,'' as used in this Agreement, means the above awards and  all other awards, including all modifications, made by the Government  and the Grantee before the effective date of this Agreement (whether or  not performance and payment have been completed and releases executed if  the Government or the Grantee has any remaining rights, duties, or  obligations under these awards.)</p><p class="depth0">2. The XYZ CORPORATION, by an amendment to its certificate of  incorporation, dated --------, 20----, has changed its corporate name to  ABC CORPORATION.</p><p class="depth0">3. This amendment accomplishes a change of corporate name only and  all rights and obligations of the Government and of the Grantee under  the awards are unaffected by this change.</p><p class="depth0">4. Documentary evidence of this change of corporate name has been  filed with the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT:</p><p class="depth0">1. The awards covered by this Agreement are amended by substituting  the name ``ABC CORPORATION'' for the name ``XYZ CORPORATION'' wherever  it appears in the awards; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Each party has executed this Agreement as of the day and year  first above written.

In such instances, USDA will ensure  that all parties properly execute a Novation Agreement (Successor in  Interest Agreement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Novation Agreement is a legal instrument executed by the  Grantee (transferor), the successor in interest (transferee), and the  Government by which, among other things, the transferor guarantees  performance of the award, the transferee assumes all obligations under  the award, and the Government recognizes the transfer of the award and  related assets. This occurs when the third party's interest in the award  arises out of the transfer of all the Grantee's assets or the entire  portion of the assets involved in performing the award. Examples  include, but are not limited to: the sale of these assets with a  provision for assuming liabilities; the transfer of these assets  incident to a merger or corporate consolidation; and the incorporation  of a proprietorship or partnership, or the formation of a partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a Grantee asks the Government to recognize a successor in  interest, the responsible ADO shall obtain the following from the  Grantee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An authenticated copy of the instrument effecting the transfer  of assets; e.g., bill of sale, certificate of merger, contract, deed,  agreement, or court decree;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A list of all affected awards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A certified copy of each resolution of the corporate parties'  boards of directors authorizing the transfer of assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A certified copy of the minutes of each corporate party's  stockholder meeting necessary to approve the transfer of assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The opinion of legal counsel for the transferor and transferee  stating that the transfer was properly effected under applicable law and  the effective date of transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> An authenticated copy of the transferee's certificate and  articles of incorporation, if a corporation was formed for the purpose  of receiving the   assets involved in performing the Government award;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Evidence of transferee's capability to perform the award; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Balance sheets of the transferor and transferee as of the dates  immediately before and after the transfer of assets, certified for  accuracy by independent accountants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The ADO will review the Agency's financial records concerning  the correct cash-on-hand balances held by the transferor to ensure that  they are properly accounted for in the transfer process. If recognizing  a successor in interest to a Government award is consistent with the  Government's interest, the ADO will prepare a Novation Agreement for  execution by all three parties. The agreement will provide that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transferee assumes all the transferor's obligations under  the award(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The transferor waives all rights under the award against the  Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The transferor guarantees performance of the award by the  transferee (a satisfactory performance bond may be accepted instead of  the guarantee); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Nothing in the agreement shall relieve the transferor or  transferee from compliance with any Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The following suggested format for an agreement may be adapted  for specific cases:</p><p class="depth0">NOVATION AGREEMENT (SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST AGREEMENT)</p><p class="depth0">THE ABC CORPORATION (Transferor), a corporation duly organized and  existing under the laws of ------------ (insert state) with its  principal office in ------------ (insert city); the XYZ CORPORATION  (Transferee), a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws  of ------------ (insert state) with its principal office in ------------  (insert city); and theNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, USDA  (Government) enter into this Agreement as of ------------ (insert the  date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTS:</p><p class="depth0">1. The Government, represented by the ADO has entered into certain  awards with the Transferor, namely: ------------ (insert award number or  delete ``namely'' and insert ``as shown in the attached list marked  `Exhibit A' and incorporated in this Agreement by reference.'') The term  ``the awards,'' as used in this Agreement, means the above awards and  all other awards, including all modifications, made between the  Government and Transferor before the effective date of this Agreement  (whether or not performance and payment have been completed and releases  executed if the Government or the Transferor has any remaining rights,  duties, or obligations under these awards.) Included in the term  ``award'' are also all modifications made under the terms and conditions  of these awards between the Government and the Transferor, on or after  the effective date of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. As of ------------, 20----, the Transferor has transferred to the  Transferee all the assets of the Transferor by virtue of a ------------  (insert terms or legal transaction involved) between the Transferor and  the Transferee.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor by  virtue of the above transfer.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Transferee has assumed all obligations and liabilities of the  Transferor under the awards by virtue of the above transfer.</p><p class="depth0">5. The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations  that may exist under the awards.</p><p class="depth0">6. It is consistent with the Government's interest to recognize the  Transferee as the successor party to the awards.</p><p class="depth0">7. Evidence of the above transfer has been filed with the  Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT BY THIS</p><p class="depth0">AGREEMENT:</p><p class="depth0">1. The Transferor confirms the transfer to the Transferee, and  waives any claims and rights against the Government that it now has or  may have in the future in connection with the awards.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform each award in  accordance with the conditions contained in the awards. The Transferee  also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all claims against,  the Transferor under the awards as if the Transferee were the original  party to the awards.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the  Transferor with respect to the awards, with the same force and effect as  if the action had been taken by the Transferee.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor's  successor in interest in and to the awards. The Transferee by this  Agreement becomes entitled to all rights, titles, and interests of the  Transferor in and to the awards as if the Transferee were the original  party to the awards. Following the effective date of this Agreement, the  term Grantee, as used in the awards, shall refer to the Transferee.</p><p class="depth0">5. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in it  shall be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Government against  the Transferor.</p><p class="depth0">6. All payments and reimbursements previously made by the Government  to the Transferor, and all other previous actions taken by the  Government under the awards, shall be considered to have discharged  those parts of the Government's obligations under the awards. All  payments and reimbursements made by the Government after the date of  this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall have the same  force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and shall constitute a  complete discharge of the Government's obligations under the awards, to  the extent of the amounts paid or reimbursed.</p><p class="depth0">7. The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is  not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give  effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related  increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the  transfer or this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the  absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay  or reimburse under the terms of the awards.</p><p class="depth0">8. The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the  performance of all obligations that the Transferee (i) assumes under  this Agreement or (ii) may undertake in the future should these awards  be modified under their terms and conditions. The Transferor waives  notice of, and consents to, any such future modifications.</p><p class="depth0">9. The awards shall remain in full force and effect, except as  modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement as of  the day and year first above written.
