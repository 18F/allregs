                            <p class="depth0">Contracting specialists and contracting officers must work in close  collaboration with the beneficiaries of the services being purchased to  ensure that contractor performance meets contract requirements and  performance standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Following is a checklist to aid analysis and review of  requirements for service contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is the statement of work complete, with a clear-cut division of  responsibility between the contracting parties?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the statement of work discussed in terms the market can  satisfy?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Does the statement of work encompass all commercially available  services that can meet the actual functional need (eliminates any  nonessential preferences that may thwart full and open competition)?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is the statement of work performance-based to the maximum extent  possible (i.e., is the acquisition structured around the purpose of the  work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work  is to be performed or a broad and imprecise statement of work)?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost effectiveness. If the response to any of the following  questions is negative, the agency may not have a valid requirement or  not be obtaining the requirement in the most cost effective manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is the statement of work written so that it supports the need  for a specific service?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the statement of work written so that it permits adequate  evaluation of contractor versus in-house cost and performance?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Are the choices of contract type, quality assurance plan,  competition strategy, or other related acquisition strategies and  procedures in the acquisition plan appropriate to ensure good   contractor performance to meet the user's needs?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a cost reimbursement contract is contemplated, is the  acquisition plan adequate to ensure that the contractor will have the  incentive to control costs under the contract?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Is the acquisition plan adequate to address the cost  effectiveness of using contractor support (either long-term or short- term) versus in-house performance?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Is the cost estimate or other supporting cost information  adequate to enable the contracting office to effectively determine  whether costs are reasonable?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Is the statement of work adequate to describe the requirement in  terms of ``what'' is to be performed as opposed to ``how'' the work is  to be accomplished?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Is the acquisition plan adequate to ensure that there is proper  consideration given to ``quality'' and ``best value?''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Control. If the response to any of the following questions is  negative, there may be a control problem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are there sufficient resources to evaluate contractor  performance when the statement of work requires the contractor to  provide advice, analysis and evaluation, opinions, alternatives, or  recommendations that could significantly influence agency policy  development or decision-making?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does the quality assurance plan provide for adequate monitoring  of contractor performance?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is the statement of work written so that it specifies a contract  deliverable or requires progress reporting on contractor performance?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is agency expertise adequate to independently evaluate the  contractor's approach, methodology, results, options, conclusions or  recommendations?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conflicts of interest. If the response to any of the following  questions is affirmative, there may be a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Can the potential offeror perform under the contract to devise  solutions or make recommendations that would influence the award of  future contracts to that contractor?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the requirement is for support services (such as system  engineering or technical direction), were any of the potential offerors  involved in developing the system design specifications or in the  production of the system?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has a potential offeror participated in earlier work involving  the same program or activity that is the subject of the present  contract, wherein the offeror had access to source selection or  proprietary information not available to other offerors competing for  the contract?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Will the contractor be evaluating a competitor's work?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Does the contract allow the contractor to accept its own  products or activities on behalf of the Government?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Will the work under this contract put the contractor in a  position to influence government decision-making, e.g., developing  regulations that will affect the contractor's current or future  business?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Will the work under this contract affect the interests of the  contractor's other clients?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Are any of the potential offerors, or their personnel who will  perform the contract, former agency officials who--while employed by the  agency--personally and substantially participated in the development of  the requirement for, or the procurement of, these services within the  past two years?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Competition. If the response to any of the following questions  is negative, competition may be unnecessarily limited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is the statement of work defined so as to avoid overly  restrictive specifications or performance standards?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the contract formulated in such a way as to avoid creating a  continuous and dependent arrangement with the same contractor?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is the use of an indefinite quantity or term contract  arrangement appropriate to obtain the required services?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Will the requirement be obtained through the use of full and  open competition?</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 2937.2_Advisory and Assistance Services</p>
