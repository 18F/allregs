                                Sec. 229.10  What the social security overall minimum guarantee is.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The social security overall minimum guarantee is the amount of total family benefits which would be paid under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service had been covered by that Act. A 100 percent overall minimum benefit may be paid, as described in Sec. 229.11. A 100 percent overall minimum based on age (age O/M) may be payable when the employee is 62 years old. The age O/M is reduced for age for months in which the O/M is payable before the employee attains retirement age. An overall minimum may also be payable before age 62 based on an employee's disability (DIB O/M). The DIB O/M is not reduced for age.


Sec. 229.11  100 percent overall minimum.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3(f)(3) of the 1974 Act guarantees that the total annuities payable to the employee and spouse, including the vested dual benefits but not including a supplemental annuity, will not be less than 100 percent of the total family benefits payable under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service after 1936 were credited as social security earnings. Subpart F describes how the 100 percent overall minimum rate is computed.</p>
