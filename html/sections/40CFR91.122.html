                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The marine engine manufacturer must notify the Administrator</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When either an engine is to be added to a certificate of  conformity or changes are to be made to a product line covered by a  certificate of conformity which may potentially affect emissions,  emissions durability, an emission related part, or the durability of an  emission related part. Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits  and EPA receives a request to amend the original application prior to  either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line.  For existing technology OB/PWC engines only, notification may occur  periodically but must occur at least on a quarterly basis and may be  submitted summarily as determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an FEL is changed for an engine family, as allowed under  Sec. 91.203. Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits and EPA  receives a request to amend the original application. The manufacturer  may not   change an FEL unless compliance under Sec. 91.207(b) is maintained  through the use of the revised FEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request to amend the engine manufacturer's existing  certificate of conformity must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A full description of the engine to be added or the change(s) to  be made in production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer's proposed test engine selection(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engineering evaluations or reasons why the original test engine  or FEL is or is not still appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator may require the engine manufacturer to perform  tests on an engine representing the engine to be added or changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decision by Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Based on the submitted request and data derived from such  testing as the Administrator may require or conduct, the Administrator  must determine whether the proposed addition or change would still be  covered by the certificate of conformity then in effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator determines that the new or changed  engine(s) meets the requirements of this subpart and the Act, the  appropriate certificate of conformity will be amended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Administrator determines that the new or changed engines  would not be covered by the certificate of conformity, the Administrator  must provide a written explanation to the engine manufacturer of his or  her decision not to amend the certificate. The manufacturer may request  a hearing on a denial. See Sec. 91.125.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator determines that the revised FEL meets the  requirements of this subpart and the Act, the appropriate certificate of  conformity will be amended to reflect the revised FEL. The certificate  of conformity is revised conditional upon compliance under  Sec. 91.207(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alternatively, an engine manufacturer may make changes in or  additions to production engines concurrently with requesting to amend  the application or certification of conformity as set forth in paragraph  (b) of this section, if the manufacturer determines that all affected  engines will still meet applicable Family Emission Limits (FELs). The  engine manufacturer must supply supporting documentation, test data, and  engineering evaluations as appropriate to support its determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, after a review, the Administrator determines additional  testing is required, the engine manufacturer must provide required test  data within 30 days or cease production of the affected engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Administrator determines that the affected engines do not  meet applicable requirements, the Administrator will notify the engine  manufacturer to cease production of the affected engines.</p>
