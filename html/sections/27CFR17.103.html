                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The bond may be obtained from any surety company authorized by  the Secretary of the Treasury to be a surety on Federal bonds. Surety  companies so authorized are listed in the current revision of Department  of the Treasury Circular 570 (Companies Holding Certificates of  Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable  Reinsuring Companies), and subject to such amendatory circulars as may  be issued from time to time. Bonds obtained from surety companies are  also governed by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9304, and 31 CFR part 223.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A bond executed by two or more surety companies shall be the  joint and several liability of the principal and the sureties; however,  each surety company may limit its liability, in terms upon the face of  the bond, to a definite, specified amount. This amount shall not exceed  the limitations prescribed for each surety company by the Secretary, as  stated in Department of the Treasury Circular 570. If the sureties limit  their liability in this way, the total of the limited liabilities shall  equal the required amount of the bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 is published in the  Federal Register annually on the first workday in July. As they occur,  interim revisions of the circular are published in the Federal Register.  Copies of the circular may be obtained from: Surety Bond Branch,  Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC  20227.  (Sec. 1, Pub. L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 1047 (31 U.S.C. 9304))</p>
