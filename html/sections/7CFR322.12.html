Our risk assessment will be based on information provided by the exporting region, information from topical scientific literature, and, if applicable, information we gain from a site visit to the exporting region.

occur there and to prevent occurrences of new bee diseases, parasites, undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees, and pests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based on the conclusions of the risk assessment, we will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to allow honeybees, honeybee germ plasm, or bees other than honeybees to be imported into the United States from that region; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deny the request in writing, stating the specific reasons for that action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will publish a notice of availability of all completed risk assessments for public comment.
