                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to the first time a covered employee performs covered service for a railroad, the employee must undergo testing for drugs. No railroad may allow a covered employee to perform covered service, unless the employee has been administered a test for drugs with a result that did not indicate the misuse of controlled substances. This requirement applies to final applicants for employment and to employees seeking to transfer for the first time from non-covered service to duties involving covered service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in subpart H of this part with respect to a test required under this subpart, the term covered employee includes an applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an applicant who declines to be tested and withdraws the application for employment, no record may be maintained of the declination.</p>
