                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Finding and repayment. If the State agency of the applicable State finds that an individual has received a payment of DUA to which the individual was not entitled under the Act and this part, whether or not the payment was due to the individual's fault or misrepresentation, the individual shall be liable to repay to the applicable State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled, and the State agency shall take all reasonable measures authorized under any State law or Federal law to recover for the account of the United States the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery by offset. (1) The State agency shall recover, insofar as is possible, the amount of any outstanding overpayment of DUA made to the individual by the State, by deductions from any DUA payable to the individual under the Act and this part, or from any compensation payable to the individual under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency, or from any assistance or allowance payable to the individual with respect to unemployment under any other Federal law administered by the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall recover, insofar as is possible, the amount of any outstanding overpayment of DUA made to the individual by the State, by deductions from any DUA payable to the individual under the Act and this part, or from any compensation payable to the individual under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency, or from any assistance or allowance payable to the individual with respect to unemployment under any other Federal law administered by the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall also recover, insofar as possible, the amount of any outstanding overpayment of DUA made to the individual by another State, by deductions from any DUA payable by the State agency to the individual under the Act and this part, or from any compensation payable to the individual under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency, or from any assistance or allowance payable to the

individual with respect to unemployment under any other Federal law administered by the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the State has in effect an agreement to implement the cross-program offset provisions of section 303(g)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 503(g)(2)), the State shall apply the provisions of such agreement to the recovery of outstanding DUA overpayments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debts due the United States. DUA payable to an individual shall be applied by the State agency for the recovery by offset of any debt due to the United States from the individual, but shall not be applied or used by the State agency in any manner for the payment of any debt of the individual to any State or any other entity or person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recovered overpayments. Overpayments recovered in any manner shall be credited or returned, as the case may be, to the appropriate account of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application of State law. Any provision of State law authorizing waiver of recovery of overpayments of compensation shall not be applicable to DUA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Final decision. Recovery of any overpayment of DUA shall not be enforced by the State agency until the determination establishing the overpayment has become final, or if appeal is taken from the determination, until the decision after opportunity for a fair hearing has become final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procedural requirements. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of Sec. 625.9 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of Sec. 625.9 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of Sec. 625.10 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fraud detection and prevention. Provisions in the procedures of each State with respect to detection and prevention of fraudulent overpayments of DUA shall be, as a minimum, commensurate with the procedures adopted by the State with respect to regular compensation and consistent with the Secretary's ``Standard for Fraud and Overpayment Detection,'' Employment Security Manual, part V, sections 7510 et seq. (Appendix C of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Disqualification for fraud. Any individual who, with respect to a major disaster, makes or causes another to make a false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact, knowing it to be false, or knowingly fails or causes another to fail to disclose a material fact, in order to obtain for the individual or any other person a payment of DUA to which the individual or any other person is not entitled, shall be disqualified as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure pertains to an initial application for DUA--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual making the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure shall be disqualified from the receipt of any DUA with respect to that major disaster; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure was made on behalf of another individual, and was known to such other individual to be a false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure, such other individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of any DUA with respect to that major disaster; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure pertains to a week for which application for a payment of DUA is made--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual making the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure shall be disqualified from the receipt of DUA for that week and the first two compensable weeks in the Disaster Assistance Period that immediately follow that week, with respect to which the individual is otherwise entitled to a payment of DUA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure was made on behalf of another individual, and was known to such other individual to be a false statement, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure, such other individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of DUA for that week and the first two compensable weeks in the Disaster Assistance Period that immediately follow that week, with respect to which the individual is otherwise entitled to a payment of DUA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Criminal penalties. The provisions of this section on recovery of overpayments and disqualification for fraudulently claiming or receiving any DUA

to which an individual was not entitled under the Act and this part shall be in addition to and shall not preclude any applicable criminal prosecution and penalties under State or Federal law.
