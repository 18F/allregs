                            <p class="depth0">The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the  Board after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before  October 1, 1981, if final Board action has not been taken before that  date, regardless of when they were initiated or when final Board action  occurs. These rules incorporate the changes made in Pub. L. No. 99-80,  99 Stat. 183, which applies generally to cases instituted after October  1, 1984. If awards are sought for cases pending on October 1, 1981 or  filed between that date and September 30, 1984, the prior statutory  provisions (to the extent they differ from the existing ones, and our  implementing rules) apply.
