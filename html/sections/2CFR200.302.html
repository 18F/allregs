                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each state must expend and account for the Federal award in  accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting  for the state's own funds. In addition, the state's and the other non- Federal entity's financial management systems, including records  documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms  and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the  preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms  and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures  adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the  Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the  Federal award. See also Sec. 200.450 Lobbying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The financial management system of each non-Federal entity must  provide for the following (see also Secs. 200.333 Retention requirements  for records, 200.334 Requests for transfer of records, 200.335 Methods  for collection, transmission and storage of information, 200.336 Access  to records, and 200.337 Restrictions on public access to records):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification, in its accounts, of all Federal awards received  and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received.  Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as  applicable, the CFDA title and number, Federal award identification  number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass- through entity, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial  results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the  reporting requirements set forth in Secs. 200.327 Financial reporting  and 200.328 Monitoring and reporting program performance. If a Federal  awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient  that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient  must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This  recipient may develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an  analysis of the documentation on hand. Similarly, a pass-through entity  must not require a subrecipient to establish an accrual accounting  system and must allow the subrecipient to develop accrual data for its  reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records that identify adequately the source and application of  funds for federally-funded activities. These records must contain  information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations,  unobligated balances, assets, expenditures, income and interest and be  supported by source documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds,  property, and other assets.

See Sec. 200.303 Internal controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal  award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Written procedures to implement the requirements of Sec. 200.305  Payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in  accordance with Subpart E--Cost Principles of this part and the terms  and conditions of the Federal award.</p>
