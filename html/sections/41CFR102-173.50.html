                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, State government

entities must register the full State name or clearly indicate the State postal code within the name. Examples of acceptable names include virginia.gov, tennesseeanytime.gov, wa.gov, nmparks.gov, mysc.gov, emaryland.gov, and ne-taxes.gov. However--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of the State postal code should not be embedded within a single word in a way that obscures the postal code. For example, Indiana (IN) should not register for win.gov, or independence.gov; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where potential conflicts arise between postal codes and existing domain names, States are encouraged to register URL's that contain the full State name.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There is no limit to the number of domain names for which a State may register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> States are encouraged to make second-level domains available for third-level registration by local governments and State Government departments and programs. For example, the State of North Carolina could register NC.GOV as a second-level domain and develop a system of registration for their local governments. The State would be free to develop policy on how the local government should be registered under NC.GOV. One possibility might be to spell out the city, thus Raleigh.NC.gov could be a resulting domain name.</p>
