                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Scholar selected after January 2005 must be employed in public  service for three of the seven years following completion of his or her  Foundation funded graduate education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Following completion of Foundation funded graduate education,  Scholars must submit a report to the Foundation by July 15 of each year.  This report will include the Scholar's current contact information as  well as a brief description of his or her employment during the past  twelve months. This reporting requirement ends when the Foundation  determines that a Scholar has reported three years of public service  employment and the Foundation notifies him or her that he or she no  longer is required to submit reports. Scholars who fail for two  consecutive years to submit the required report to the Foundation will  be considered to have failed to complete the three year public service  requirement of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Scholar who fails to be employed in public service for three  out of the first seven years following completion of his or her  Foundation funded graduate education must repay to the Foundation an  amount equal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All of the Scholarship stipends received,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of receipt of  each payment until repayment is made to the Foundation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable collection fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The repayment obligation of paragraph (c) of this section  accrues on the first July 15 on which it becomes impossible for a  Scholar to fulfill the three year public service requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section. For example, the repayment obligation  would accrue on July 15 of the sixth year following completion of  Foundation funded graduate education for a Scholar who has been employed  in the public service for only one of those six years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Foundation will send to the Scholar's last known address a  notice that his or her repayment obligation has accrued. The failure,  however, of the Foundation to send, or the Scholar to receive, such a  notice does not alter or delay the Scholar's repayment obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Foundation may employ whatever remedies are available to it  to collect any unpaid obligation accruing under this Sec. 1801.63.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon application by the Scholar showing good cause for doing so,  the Foundation may waive or modify the repayment obligation established  by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Foundation will establish a process for appealing any  disputes concerning the accrual of the repayment obligation imposed by  paragraph (c) of this section. The Foundation will publish on its Web  site http://www.truman.gov information about this appeals process and  other information pertinent to repayment obligations accruing under this  Sec. 1801.63.
