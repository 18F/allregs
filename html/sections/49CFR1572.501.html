The fee to obtain a TWIC when the applicant has undergone a comparable threat assessment in connection with an HME, FAST card, other threat assessment deemed to be comparable under 49 CFR 1572.5(e) or holds a Merchant Mariner Document or Merchant Mariner License is made up of the total of the following segments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Enrollment Segment Fee covers the costs for TSA or its agent to enroll applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Reduced Card Production/Security Threat Assessment Segment covers the costs for TSA to conduct a portion of the security threat assessment and issue a TWIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Card Replacement Fee.

TSA will not issue any refunds of fees required under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Imposition of fees. TSA routinely establishes and collects fees to conduct the security threat assessment and credentialing process. These fees apply to all entities requesting a security threat assessment and/or credential. The fees described in this section for an individual who applies to obtain, renew, or replace a TWIC under 49 CFR part 1572, shall be published as a Notice in the Federal Register. TSA reviews the amount of these fees periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. Fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts shall be determined by current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely-accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the

provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.
