                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Wages, salaries, commissions paid salesmen,  compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of profits,  commissions on insurance premiums, tips, bonuses (including Christmas  bonuses), termination or severance pay, rewards, jury fees, marriage  fees and other contributions received by a clergyman for services, pay  of persons in the military or naval forces of the United States, retired  pay of employees, pensions, and retirement allowances are income to the  recipients unless excluded by law. Several special rules apply to  members of the Armed Forces, National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and Public Health Service of the United States; see  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Code provides special rules including the following items in  gross income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Distributions from employees' trusts, see sections 72, 402, and  403, and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compensation for child's services (in child's gross income),  see section 73 and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prizes and awards, see section 74 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Similarly, the Code provides special rules excluding the  following items from gross income in whole or in part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gifts, see section 102 and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compensation for injuries or sickness, see section 104 and the  regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts received under accident and health plans, see section  105 and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Scholarship and fellowship grants, see section 117 and the  regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Miscellaneous items, see section 122.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Members of the Armed Forces, National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and Public Health Service. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subsistence and uniform  allowances granted commissioned officers, chief warrant officers,  warrant officers, and enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces, National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public   Health Service of the United States, and amounts received by them as  commutation of quarters, are excluded from gross income. Similarly, the  value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded  from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, quarters or subsistence includes  the following allowances for expenses incurred after December 31, 1993,  by members of the Armed Forces, members of the commissioned corps of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and members of the  commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, to the extent that the  allowances are not otherwise excluded from gross income under another  provision of the Internal Revenue Code: a dislocation allowance,  authorized by 37 U.S.C. 407; a temporary lodging allowance, authorized  by 37 U.S.C. 405; a temporary lodging expense, authorized by 37 U.S.C.  404a; and a move-in housing allowance, authorized by 37 U.S.C. 405.

Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section (relating to  certain property transferred after June 30, 1969), if services are paid  for in property, the fair market value of the property taken in payment  must be included in income as compensation. If services are paid for in  exchange for other services, the fair market value of such other  services taken in payment must be included in income as compensation. If  the services are rendered at a stipulated price, such price will be  presumed to be the fair market value of the compensation received in the  absence of evidence to the contrary. For special rules relating to  certain options received as compensation, see Sec. Sec. 1.61-15, 1.83- 7, and section 421 and the regulations thereunder. For special rules  relating to premiums paid by an employer for an annuity contract which  is not subject to section 403(a), see section 403(c) and the regulations  thereunder and Sec. 1.83-8(a). For special rules relating to  contributions made to an employees' trust which is not exempt under  section 501, see section 402(b) and the regulations thereunder and Sec.  1.83-8(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property transferred to employee or independent contractor. (i)  Except as otherwise provided in section 421 and the regulations  thereunder and Sec. 1.61-15 (relating to stock options), and paragraph  (d)(6)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, if property is transferred by an employer to  an employee or if property is transferred to an independent contractor,  as compensation for services, for an amount less than its fair market  value, then regardless of whether the transfer is in the form of a sale  or exchange, the difference between the amount paid for the property and  the amount of its fair market value at the time of the transfer is  compensation and shall be included in the gross income of the employee  or independent contractor. In computing the gain or loss from the  subsequent sale of such property, its basis shall be the amount paid for  the property increased by the amount of   such difference included in gross income</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cost of life insurance on the life of the employee.  Generally, life insurance premiums paid by an employer on the life of  his employee where the proceeds of such insurance are payable to the  beneficiary of such employee are part of the gross income of the  employee. However, the amount includible in the employee's gross income  is determined with regard to the provisions of section 403 and the  regulations thereunder in the case of an individual contract issued  after December 31, 1962, or a group contract, which provides incidental  life insurance protection and which satisfies the requirements of  section 401(g) and Sec. 1.401-9, relating to the nontransferability of  annuity contracts. For example, if an employee or independent contractor  is the owner (as defined in Sec. 1.61-22(c)(1)) of a life insurance  contract and the payments with regard to such contract are not split- dollar loans under Sec. 1.7872-15(b)(1), the employee or independent  contractor must include in income the amount of any such payments by the  employer or service recipient with respect to such contract during any  year to the extent that the employee's or independent contractor's  rights to the life insurance contract are substantially vested (within  the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(b)). This result is the same regardless of  whether the employee or independent contractor has at all times been the  owner of the life insurance contract or the contract previously has been  owned by the employer or service recipient as part of a split-dollar  life insurance arrangement (as defined in Sec. 1.61-22(b)(1) or (2))  and was transferred by the employer or service recipient to the employee  or independent contractor under Sec. 1.61-22(g). For the special rules  relating to the includibility in an employee's gross income of an amount  equal to the cost of certain group term life insurance on the employee's  life which is carried directly or indirectly by his employer, see  section 79 and the regulations thereunder. For special rules relating to  the exclusion of contributions by an employer to accident and health  plans for the employee, see section 106 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cost of group-term life insurance on the life of an individual  other than an employee. The cost (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of  Sec. 1.79-3) of group-term life insurance on the life of an individual  other than an employee (such as the spouse or dependent of the employee)  provided in connection with the performance of services by the employee  is includible in the gross income of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Meals and living quarters. The value of living quarters or meals  which an employee receives in addition to his salary constitutes gross  income unless they are furnished for the convenience of the employer and  meet the conditions specified in section 119 and the regulations  thereunder. For the treatment of rental value of parsonages or rental  allowance paid to ministers, see section 107 and the regulations  thereunder; for the treatment of statutory subsistence allowances  received by police, see section 120 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stock and notes transferred to employee or independent  contractor. Except as otherwise provided by section 421 and the  regulations thereunder and Sec. 1.61-15 (relating to stock options),  and paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, if a corporation transfers its  own stock to an employee or independent contractor as compensation for  services, the fair market value of the stock at the time of transfer  shall be included in the gross income of the employee or independent  contractor. Notes or other evidences of indebtedness received in payment  for services constitute income in the amount of their fair market value  at the time of the transfer. A taxpayer receiving as compensation a note  regarded as good for its face value at maturity, but not bearing  interest, shall treat as income as of the time of receipt its fair  discounted value computed at the prevailing rate. As payments are  received on such a note, there shall be included in income that portion  of each payment which represents the proportionate part of the discount  originally taken on the entire note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> is  also applicable to transfers subject to a restriction which has a  significant effect on its value at the time of transfer and to which  Sec. 1.83-8(b) (relating to transitional rules with respect to  transfers of restricted property) applies. For special rules relating to  options to purchase stock or other property which are issued as  compensation for services, see Sec. 1.61-15 and section 421 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Certain property transferred, premiums paid, and contributions  made in connection with the performance of services after June 30,  1969--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exception. Paragraph (d) (1), (2), (4), and (5) of this  section and Sec. 1.61-15 do not apply to the transfer of property (as  defined in Sec. 1.83-3(e)) after June 30, 1969, unless Sec. 1.83-8  (relating to the applicability of section 83 and transitional rules)  applies. If section 83 applies to a transfer of property, and the  property is not subject to a restriction that has a significant effect  on the fair market value of such property, then the rules contained in  paragraph (d) (1), (2), and (4) of this section and Sec. 1.61-15 shall  also apply to such transfer to the extent such rules are not  inconsistent with section 83.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cross references. For rules relating to premiums paid by an  employer for an annuity contract which is not subject to section 403(a),  see section 403(c) and the regulations thereunder.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6696, 28 FR  13450, Dec. 12, 1963; T.D. 6856, 30 FR 13316, Oct. 20, 1965; T.D. 7544,  43 FR 31913, July 24, 1978; T.D. 7623, 44 FR 28800, May 17, 1979; T.D.  8256, 54 FR 28582, July 6, 1989; T.D. 8607, 60 FR 40076, Aug. 7, 1995;  T.D. 9092, 68 FR 54344, Sept. 17, 2003]    Sec. 1.61-2T  Taxation of fringe benefits--1985 through 1988  (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> provides that,  except as otherwise provided in subtitle A, gross income includes  compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits,  and similar items. Examples of fringe benefits include: an employer- provided automobile, a flight on an employer-provided aircraft, an  employer-provided free or discounted commercial airline flight, an  employer-provided vacation, and employer-provided discount on property  or services, and emkployer-provided membership in a country club or  other social club, and an employer-provided ticket to an entertainment  or sporting event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fringe benefits excluded from income. To the extent that a  particular fringe benefit is specifically excluded from gross income  pursuant to another section of subtitle A, that section shall govern the  treatment of the fringe benefit. Thus, if the requirements of the  governing section are satisfied, the fringe benefits may be excludable  from gross income. Examples of excludable fringe benefits are qualified  tuition reductions provided to an employee (section 177(d)); meals and  lodging furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer  (section 119); and benefits provided under a dependent care assistance  program (section 129). Similarly, the value of the use by an employee of  an employer-provided vehicle or a flight provided to an employee on an  employer-provided aircraft may be excludable from income under section  105 (because, for example, the trnsportation is provided for medical  reasons) if and to the extent that the requirements of that section are  satisfied. Section 61 and the regulations thereunder shall apply,  however, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with such other  section. For example, many fringe benefits specifically addressed in  other sections of subtitle A are excluded from gross income only to the  extent that they do not exceed specific dollar or percentage limits, or  only if certain other requirements are met. If the limits are exceeded  or the requirements are not met, some or all of the fringe benefit may  be   includible in gross income. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compensation for services. A fringe benefit provided in  connection with the performance of services shall be considered to have  been provided as compensation for servcies. Refraining from the  performance of services (such as pursuant to a covenant not to compete)  is deemed to be the performance of services for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recipient of a fringe benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. A fringe benefit  is included in the income of the ``recipient'' of the fringe benefit.  The recipient of a fringe benefit is the person performing the services  in connection with which the fringe benefit is provided. Thus, a person  may be considered to be a recipient, even though that person did not  actually receive the fringe benefit. For example, a fringe benefit  provided to any person is connection with the performance of services by  another person is considered to have been provided to the person who  performs the services and not the person who receives the fringe  benefit. In addition, if a fringe benefit is provided to a person, but  taxable to a second person as the recipient, such benefit is referred to  as provided to the second person and use by the first person is  considered use by the second person. For example, provision of an  automobile to an employee's spouse by the employer is taxable to the  employee as the recipient. The automobile is referred to as available to  the employee and use by the employee's spouse is considered use by the  employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recipient may be other than an employee. The recipient of a  fringe benefit need not be an employee of the provider of the fringe  benefit, but may be a partner, director, or an independent contractor.  For convenience, the term ``employee'' includes a reference to any  recipient of a fringe benefit, unless otherwise specifically provided in  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Provider of a fringe benefit. The ``provider'' of a fringe  benefit is that person for whom the services are performed, regardless  of whether that person actually provides the fringe benefit to the  recipient. The provider of a fringe benefit need not be the employer of  the recipient of the fringe benefit, but may be, for example, a client  or customer of an independent contractor. For convenience, the term  ``employer'' includes a reference to any provider of a fringe benefit,  unless otherwise specifically provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. This section is effective from January 1, 1985,  to December 31, 1988, with respect to fringe benefits furnished before  January 1, 1989. No inference may be drawn from the promulgation or  terms of this section concerning the application of law in effect prior  to January 1, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of fringe benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An employee must  include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the  fringe benefit exceeds the sum of (i) the amount, if any, paid for the  benefit, and (ii) the amount, if any, specifically excluded from gross  income by some other section of subtitle A. Therefore, for example, if  the employee pays fair market value for what is received, no amount is  includible in the gross income of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fair market value. In general, fair market value is determined  on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Specifically, the fair  market value of a fringe benefit is that amount a (hypothetical person  would have to pay a hypothetical third party to obtain (i.e., purchase  or lease) the particular fringe benefit. Thus, for example, the effect  of any special relationship that may exist between the employer and the  employee must be disregarded. This also means that an employee's  subjective perception of the value of a fringe benefit is not relevant  to the determination of a fringe benefit's fair market value. In  addition, the cost incurred by the employer is not determinative of the  fair market value of the fringe benefit. For special rules relating to  the valuation of certain fringe benefits, see paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion from income based on cost. If a statutory exclusion  phrased in terms of cost applies to the provision of a fringe benefit,  section 61 does not require the inclusion in the recipient's gross  income of the difference between   the fair market value and the excludable cost of that fringe benefit.  For example, section 129 provides an exclusion from an employee's gross  income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to provide dependent  care assistance to employees. Even if the fair market value of the  dependent care assistance exceeds the employer's cost, the excess is not  subject to inclusion under section 61 and this section. If the statutory  cost exclusion is a limited amount, however, then the fair market value  of the fringe benefit attributable to any excess cost is subject to  inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fair market value of the availability of an employer-provided  vehicle. If the vehicle special valuation rules of paragraph (d), (e),  or (f) of this section are not used by a taxpayer entitled to use such  rules, the value of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle is  determined under the general valuation principles set forth in this  section. In general, such valuation must be determined by reference to  the cost to a hypothetical person of leasing from a hypothetical third  party the same or comparable vehicle on the same or comparable terms in  the geographic area in which the vehicle is available for use. Unless  the employee can substantiate that the same or comparable vehicle could  have been leased on a cents-per-mile basis, the value of the  availability of the vehicle cannot be determined by reference to a  cents-per-mile rate applied to the number of miles the vehicle is  driven. An example of a comparable lease term is the amount of time that  the vehicle is available to the employee for use, e.g., a one-year  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fair market value of a flight on an employer-provided aircraft.  If the non-commercial flight special valuation rule of paragraph (g) of  this section is not used (or is not properly used) by a taxpayer  entitled to use such rule, the value of a flight on an employer-provided  aircraft is determined under the general valuation principles set forth  in this section. An example of how the general valuation principles  would apply is that if an employee whose flight is primarily personal  controls the use of an aircraft with respect to such flight, such flight  is valued by reference to how much it would cost a hypothetical person  to charter the same or comparable aircraft for the same or comparable  flight. The cost to charter the aircraft must be allocated among all  employees on board the aircraft based on all the facts and  circumstances, including which employees controlled the use of the  aircraft. Notwithstanding the allocation required by the preceding  sentence, no additional amount shall be included in the income of any  employee whose flight is properly valued under the special valuation  rule of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special valuation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Paragraphs (d) through  (j) of this section provide special valuation rules that may be used  under certain circumstances for certain commonly provided fringe  benefits. Paragraph (d) provides a lease valuation rule relating to  employer-provided automobiles. Paragraph (e) provides a cents-per-mile  valuation rule relating to employer-provided vehicles. Paragraph (f)  provides a commuting valuation rule relating to employer-provided  vehicles. Paragraph (g) provides a flight valuation rule relating to  flights on employer-provided aircraft. Paragraph (h) provides a flight  valuation rule relating to flights on commercial airlines. Paragraph (i)  is reserved. Paragraph (j) provides a meal valuation rule relating to  employer-operated eating facilities for employees. For general rules  relating to the valuation of fringe benefits not eligible for valuation  under the special valuation rules, see paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of the special valuation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The Special  valuation rules may be used for income, employment tax, and reporting  purposes. Use of any of the special valuation rules is optional. An  employer need not use the same vehicle special valuation rule for all  vehicles provided to all employees. For example, an employer may use the  automobile lease valuation rule for automobiles provided to some  employees, and the commuting and vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rules  for automobiles provided to other employees. Except as otherwise  provided, however, if either the commercial flight valuation rule or the  noncommercial flight   valuation rule is used, such rule must be used by an employer to value  all flights taken by employees in a calendar year. Effective January 1,  1986, if an employer uses one of the special rules to value the benefit  provided to an employee, the employee may not use another special rule  to value that benefit. The employee may, however, use general valuation  rules based on facts and circumstances (see paragraph (b) of this  section). Effective January 1, 1986, an employee may only use a special  valuation rule if the employer uses the rule. If a special rule is used,  it must be used for all purposes. If an employer properly uses a special  rule and the employee uses the special rule, the employee must include  in gross income the amount determined by the employer under the special  rule less any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer. The  employer and the employee may use the special rules to determine the  amount of the reimbursement due the employer by the employee. If an  employer properly uses a special rule and properly determines the amount  of an employee's working condition fringe under section 132 and Sec.  1.132-1T (under the general rule or under a special rule), and the  employee uses the special valuation rule, the employee must include in  gross income the amount determined by the employer less any amount  reimbursed by the employee to the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use of vehicle special valuation rules  for 1985 and 1986. For purposes of valuing the use or availability of a  vehicle, the consistency rules provided in paragraphs (d)(6) and (e)(5)  of this section (relating to the automobile lease valuation rule and the  vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, respectively) apply for 1987 and  thereafter. Therefore, for 1985 and 1986 an employer (and employee,  subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) may use any applicable  special valuation rule (or no special valuation rule) to value the use  or availability of a vehicle, subject to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> also apply to  employees using the special valuation rules of paragraphs (d) or (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Employee's use of special valuation rules for 1985. An employee  may use a special valuation rule (other than the rule in paragraph (e)  of this section relating to the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule)  during 1985 even if the employer does not use the same special valuation  rule during 1985. An employee's use of a special valuation rule in 1986  and thereafter must be consistent with his employer's use of the rule as  required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that an employer properly uses the automobile  lease valuation rule in 1985. The employer may use the vehicle cents- per-mile valuation rule in 1986 if the requirements of the vehicle  cents-per-mile valuation rule are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that an employer does not use a special valuation  rule to value the availability of an automobile in 1985. The employer  may use any of the special valuation rules in 1986 if the requirements  of the rule chosen are satisfied. The same applies for 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume that an employer properly uses the vehicle cents- per-mile valuation rule in 1985. The employer may continue to use to the  rule or use any of the other special valuation rules to value the  benefit provided in 1986 if the requirements of the rule chosen are  satisfied. Alternatively, the employer may use none of the special  valuation rules in 1986 but use any of the rules in 1987 if the  requirements of the rule chosen are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume that an employee properly uses the automobile  lease valuation rule in 1985. In 1986 and thereafter the employee may  use a special valuation rule only if the employee's employer uses the  same special   valuation rule. The employee may use general valuation principles to  value the benefit provided in 1986 and thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election to use the special valuation rules--A particular  special valuation rule is deemed to have been elected by the employer  (and, if applicable, by the employee), if the employer (and, if  applicable, the employee) determines the value of the fringe benefit  provided by applying the special valuation rule and treats such value as  the fair market value of the fringe benefit for income, employment tax,  and reporting purposes. Neither the employer nor the employee is  required to notify the Internal Revenue Service of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of section 414 to employers. For purposes of  paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section, except as otherwise provided  therein, the term ``employer'' includes all entities required to be  treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), or (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Valuation formulas contained in the special valuation rules. The  valuation formulas contained in the special valuation rules are provided  only for use in connection with such rules. Thus, when a special  valuation rule is properly applied to a fringe benefit, the Commissioner  will accept the value calculated pursuant to the rule as the fair market  value of that fringe benefit. However, when a special valuation rule is  not properly applied to a fringe benefit (see, for example, paragraph  (g)(11) of this section), or when a special valuation rule is not used  to value a fringe benefit by a taxpayer entitled to use the rule, the  fair market value of that fringe benefit may not be determined by  reference to any value calculated under any special valuation rule.

The Annual Lease Values  determined under the rules of this paragraph (d) are based on a four- year lease term. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in paragraph  (d)(2)(v) of this section, the Annual Lease Value calculated by applying  paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section shall remain in effect for  the period that begins with the first date the special valuation rule of  paragraph (d) of this section is applied by the employer to the  automobile and ends on December 31 of the fourth full calendar year  following that date. The Annual Lease Value for each subsequent four- year period is calculated by determining the fair market value of the  automobile as of the January 1 following the period described in the  previous sentence and selecting the amount in column 2 of the Annual  Lease Value Table corresponding to the appropriate dollar range in  column 1 of the Table. If, however, the employer is using the special  accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B., August  5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on the value of  noncash fringe benefits), the employer may calculate the Annual Lease  Value for each subsequent four-   year period as of the beginning of the special accounting period that  begins immediately prior to the January 1 described in the previous  sentence. For example, assume that pursuant to Announcement 85-113, an  employer uses the special accounting rule. Assume further that beginning  on November 1, 1985, the special accounting period is November 1 to  October 31 and that the employer elects to use the special valuation  rule of this paragraph (d) as of January 1, 1985. The employer may  recalculate the Annual Lease Value as of November 1, 1988, rather than  as of January 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transfer of the automobile to another employee. Unless the  primary purpose of the transfer is to reduce Federal taxes, if an  employer transfers an automobile from one employee to another employee,  the employer may recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair  market value of the automobile as of January 1 of the year of transfer.  If, however, the employer is using the special accounting rule provided  in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B., August 5, 1985) (relating to the  reporting of and withholding on the value of noncash fringe benefits),  the employer may recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair  market value of the automobile as of the beginning of the special  accounting period in which the transfer occurs. If the employer does not  recalculate the Annual Lease Value, and the employee to whom the  automobile is transferred uses the special valuation rule, the employee  may not recalculate the Annual Lease Value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Services included in, or excluded from, the Annual Lease Value  Table--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance and insurance included. The Annual Lease Values  contained in the Annual Lease Value Table include the fair market value  of maintenance of, and insurance for, the automobile. Neither an  employer nor an employee may reduce the Annual Lease Value by the fair  market value of any service included in the Annual Lease Value that is  not provided by the employer, such as reducing the Annual Lease Value by  the fair market value of a maintenance service contract or insurance. An  employer or employee may take into account the services actually  provided with respect to the automobile by valuing the availability of  the automobile under the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel excluded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The Annual Lease Values do not  include the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer,  regardless of whether fuel is provided in kind or its cost is reimbursed  by or charged to the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Valuation of fuel provided in kind. The provision of fuel in  kind may be valued at fair market value based on all the facts and  circumstances or, in the alternative, it may be valued at 5.5 cents per  mile for all miles driven by the employee. However, the provision of  fuel in kind may not be valued at 5.5 cents per mile for miles driven  outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico. For purposes of this  section, the United States includes the United States and its  territories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this  section reimburses employees for the cost of fuel or allows employees to  charge the employer for the cost of the fuel, however, the fair market  value of fuel provided to those automobiles may be determined by  reference to the employer's fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost. The  fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost in equal to the fleet-average  per-gallon fuel cost divided by the fleet-average miles-per-gallon rate.  The averages described in the preceding sentence must be determined by  averaging the per-gallon fuel costs and miles-per-gallon rates of a  representative sample of the automobiles in the fleet equal to the  greater of ten percent of the automobiles in the fleet or 20 automobiles  for a representative period, such as a two month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All other services excluded. The fair market value of any  service not specifically identified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this  section that is provided   by the employer with respect to an automobile (such as the services of a  chauffeur) must be added to the Annual Lease Value of the automobile in  determining the fair market value of the benefit provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Availability of an automobile for less than an entire calendar  year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pro-rated Annual Lease Value used for continuous availability  of 30 or more days. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)  of this section, for periods of continuous availability of 30 or more  days, but less than an entire calendar year, the value of the  availability of the employer-provided automobile is the pro-rated Annual  Lease Value. The pro-rated Annual Lease Value is calculated by  multiplying the applicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the number of days of availability and the  denominator of which is 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Daily Lease Value used for continuous availability of less than  30 days. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this  section, for periods of continuous availability of one or more but less  than 30 days, the value of the availability of the employer-provided  automobile is the Daily Lease Value. The Daily Lease Value is calculated  by multiplying the applicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the  numerator of which is four times the number of days of availability and  the denominator of which is 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Election to treat all periods as periods of at least 30 days.  A pro-rated Annual Lease Value may be applied with respect to a period  of continuous availability of less than 30 days, by treating the  automobile as if it had been available for 30 days, if to do so would  result in a lower valuation than applying the Daily Lease Value to the  shorter period of actual availability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Periods of unavailability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. In general, a pro- rated Annual Lease Value (as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this  section) is used to value the availability of an employer-provided  automobile when the automobile is available to an employee for a period  of continuous availability of at least 30 days but less than the entire  calendar year. Neither an employer nor an employee may use a pro-rated  Annual Lease Value when the reduction of Federal taxes is the primary  reason the automobile is unavailable to an employee during the calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Unavailability for personal reasons of the employee. If an  automobile is unavailable to an employee because of personal reasons of  the employee, such as while the employee is on vacation, a pro-rated  Annual Lease Value may not be used. For example, assume an automobile is  available to an employee during the first five months of the year and  during the last five months of the year. Assume further that the period  of unavailability occurs because the employee is on vacation. The Annual  Lease Value, if it is applied, must be applied with respect to the  entire 12 month period. The Annual Lease Value may not be pro-rated to  take into account the two-month period of unavailability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fair market value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of determining  the Annual Lease Value of an automobile under the Annual Lease Value  Table, the fair market value of an automobile is that amount a  hypothetical person would have to pay a hypothetical third party to  purchase the particular automobile provided. Thus, for example, any  special relationship that may exist between the employee and the  employer must be disregarded. Also, the employee's subjective perception  of the value of the automobile is not relevant to the determination of  the automobile's fair market value. In addition, except as provided in  paragraph (d)(5) (ii) of this section, the cost incurred by the employer  of either purchasing of leasing the automobile is not determinative of  the fair market value of the automobile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe-harbor valuation rule. For purposes of calculating the  Annual Lease Value of an automobile under this paragraph (d), the safe- harbor value of the automobile may be used as the fair market value of  the automobile For an automobile owned by the employer, the safe-harbor  value of the automobile is the employer's cost of purchasing the  automobile, provided the purchase is made at arm's length. For an  automobile leased by the employer, the safe-harbor value of the  automobile is the value determined   under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of nationally recognized pricing guides. The fair market  value of an automobile that is (A) provided to an employee prior to  January 1, 1985, (B) being revalued pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) (iv)  or (v) of this section, or (C) is a leased automobile being valued  pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, may be determined by  using the retail value of such automobile as reported in a nationally  recognized publication that regularly reports new or used automobile  retail values, whichever is applicable. The values contained in (and  obtained from) the publication must be reasonable with respect to the  automobile being valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fair market value of special equipment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Certain equipment  excluded. The fair market value of an automobile does not include the  fair market value of any telephone or any specialized equipment that is  added to or carried in the automobile if the presence of such equipment  is necessitated by, and attributable to, the business needs of the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use of specialized equipment outside of employer's business. The  value of specialized equipment must be included, however, if the  employee to whom the automobile is available uses the specialized  equipment in a trade of business of the employee other than the  employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Equipment susceptible to personal use. The exclusion rule  provided in this paragraph (d)(5)(iv) does not apply to specialized  equipment susceptible to personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fleet-average valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An employer with a  fleet of 20 or more automobiles may use a fleet-average value for  purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Values of the automobiles in  the fleet. The fleet-average value is the average of the fair market  values of each automobile in the fleet. The fair market value of each  automobile in the fleet shall be determined, pursuant to the rules of  paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv) of this section, as of the later of  January 1, 1985, or the first date on which the automobile is made  available to any employee of the employer for personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> and (2) the end of  such accounting period for December 31.) The revaluation rules of  paragraph (d)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section do not apply to  automobiles valued under this paragraph (d)(5)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limitations on use of fleet-average rule. The rule provided in  this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may not be used for any automobile whose fair  market value (determined pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv)  of this section as of either the first date on which the automobile is  made available to any employee of the employer for personal use or, if  later, January 1, 1985) exceeds $16,500. In addition, the rule provided  in   this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may only be used for automobiles that the  employer reasonably expects will regularly be used in the employer's  trade or business. Infrequent use of the vehicle, such as for trips to  the airport or between the employer's multiple business premises, does  not constitute regular use of the vehicle in the employer's trade or  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Additional automobiles added to the fleet. If the rule provided  in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) is used by an employer, it must be used for  every automobile included in or added to the fleet that meets the  requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(C) of this section. The fleet- average value in effect at the time an automobile is added to the fleet  is treated as the fair market value of the automobile for purposes of  determining the Annual Lease Value of the automobile until the fleet- average value changes pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Use of the fleet-average rule by employees. An employee can only  use the fleet-average value if it is used by the employer. If an  employer uses the fleet-average value, and the employee uses the special  valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section, the employee must use  the fleet-average value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consistency rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of the automobile lease valuation  rule by an employer. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) (v)(B) of  this section, an employer may adopt the automobile lease valuation rule  of this paragraph (d) for an automobile only if the rule is adopted with  respect to the later of the period that begins on January 1, 1987, or  the first period in which the automobile is made available to an  employee of the employer for personal use or, if the commuting valuation  rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the automobile is  first made available to an employee of the employer for personal use,  the first period in which the commuting valuation rule is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An employer must use the automobile lease valuation rule for  all subsequent periods. Once the automobile lease valuation rule has  been adopted for an automobile by an employer, the rule must be used by  the employer for all subsequent periods in which the employer makes the  automobile available to any employee, except that the employer may, for  any period during which use of the automobile qualifies for the  commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the  commuting valuation rule with respect to the automobile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of the automobile lease valuation rule by an employee.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, an  employee may adopt the automobile lease valuation rule for an automobile  only if the rule is adopted (A) by the employer and (B) with respect to  the first period in which the automobile for which the employer  (consistent with paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section) adopted the rule  is made available to that employee for personal use, or, if the  commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when  the automobile is first made available to that employee for personal  use, the first period in which the commuting valuation rule is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An employee must use the automobile lease valuation rule for  all subsequent periods. Once the automobile lease valuation rule has  been adopted for an automobile by an employee, the rule must be used by  the employee for all subsequent periods in which the automobile for  which the rule is used is available to the employee, except that the  employee may, for any period during which use of the automobile  qualifies for use of the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of  this section and for which the employer uses the rule, use the commuting  valuation rule with respect to the automobile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Replacement automobiles. Notwithstanding anything in this  paragraph (D)(6) to the contrary, if the automobile lease valuation rule  is used by an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect  to a particular automobile, and a replacement automobile is provided to  the employee for the primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the  employer, or the employer and the employee, using the rule must continue  to use the rule with respect to the replacement automobile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. Under the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this  paragraph (e), if an   employer provides an employee with the use of a vehicle that (A) the  employer reasonably expects will be regularly used in the employer's  trade or business throughout the calendar year (or such shorter period  as the vehicle may be owned or leased by the employer) or (B) satisfies  the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the value of  the benefit provided in the calendar year is the standard mileage rate  provided in the applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure (``cents- per-mile rate'') multiplied by the total number of miles the vehicle is  driven by the employee for personal purposes. For 1985, the standard  mileage rate is 21 cents per mile for the first 15,000 miles and 11  cents per mile for all miles over 15,000. See Rev. Proc. 85-49. The  standard mileage rate must be applied to personal miles independent of  business miles. Thus, for example, if an employee drives 20,000 personal  miles and 35,000 business miles in 1985, the value of the personal use  of the vehicle is $3,700 (15,000x$.21+5,000x$.11). For purposes of this  section, the use of a vehicle for personal purposes is any use of the  vehicle other than use in the employee's trade or business of being an  employee of the employer. Infrequent use of the vehicle, such as for  trips to the airport or between the employer's multiple business  premises, does not constitute regular use of the vehicle in the  employer's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, use of the  vehicle by an individual (other than the employee) whose use would be  taxed to the employee is not considered use by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitation on use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation  rule. The value of the use of an automobile (as defined in paragraph  (d)(1)(ii) of this section) may not be determined under the vehicle  cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) if the fair market  value of the automobile (determined pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5) (i)  through (iv) of this section as of the later of January 1, 1985, or the  first date on which the automobile is made available to any employee of  the employer for personal use) exceeds $12,800. No inference may be  drawn from the promulgation or terms of this section concerning the  application of law in effect prior to January 1, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of vehicle. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the  term ``vehicle'' means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured  primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term  ``vehicle'' includes an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Services included in, or excluded from, the cents-per-mile  rate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance and insurance included. The cents-per-mile rate  includes the fair market value of maintenance of, and   insurance for, the vehicle. An employer may not reduce the cents-per- mile rate by the fair market value of any service included in the cents- per-mile rate but not provided by the employer. An employer or employee  may take into account the services provided with respect to the  automobile by valuing the availability of the automobile under the  general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel provided by the employer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Miles driven in the United  States, Canada, and Mexico. With respect to miles driven in the United  States, Canada, and Mexico, the cents-per-mile rate includes the fair  market value of fuel provided by the employer. If fuel is not provided  by the employer, the cents-per-mile rate may be reduced by no more than  5.5 cents or the amount specified in any applicable Revenue Ruling or  Revenue Procedure. For purposes of this section, the United States  includes the United States and its territories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Miles driven outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico. With  respect to miles driven outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico,  the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer is not reflected  in the cents-per-mile rate. Accordingly, the cents-per-mile rate may be  reduced but by no more than 5.5 cents or the amount specified in any  applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure. If the employer provides  the fuel in kind, it must be valued based on all the facts and  circumstances. If the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of  fuel or allows the employee to charge the employer for the cost of fuel,  the fair market value of the fuel is generally the amount of the actual  reimbursement or the amount charged, provided the purchase of fuel is at  arm's length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Valuation of personal use only. The vehicle cents-per-mile  valuation rule of this paragraph (e) may only be used to value the miles  driven for personal purposes. Thus, the employer must include an amount  in an employee's income with respect to the use of a vehicle that is  equal to the product of the number of personal miles driven by the  employee and the appropriate cents-per-mile rate. The employer may not  include in income a greater or lesser amount; for example, the employer  may not include in income 100 percent (all business and personal miles)  of the value of the use of the vehicle. The term ``personal miles''  means all miles driven by the employee except miles driven by the  employee is the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consistency rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile  valuation rule by an employer. An employer must adopt the vehicle cents- per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) for a vehicle by the later  of the period that begins on January 1, 1987, or the first period in  which the vehicle is used by an employee of the employer for personal  use or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section  is used when the vehicle is first used by an employee of the employer  for personal use, the first period in which the commuting valuation rule  is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An employer must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule  for all subsequent periods. Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation  rule has been adopted for a vehicle by an employer, the rule must be  used by the employer for all subsequent periods in which the vehicle  qualifies for use of the rule, except that (A) the employer may, for any  period during which use of the vehicle qualifies for the commuting  valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the commuting  valuation rule with respect to the vehicle, and (B) if the employer  elects to use the automobile lease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of  this section for a period in which the vehicle does not qualify for use  of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, then the employer must  comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If the  vehicle fails to qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation  rule during a subsequent period, the employer may adopt for such  subsequent period and thereafter any other special valuation rule for  which the vehicle then qualifies. For purposes of paragraph (d)(6) of  this section, the first day on which an automobile with respect to which  the vehicle cents-per-mile rule had been used fails to qualify for use  of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation   rule may be deemed to be the first day on which the automobile is  available to an employee of the employer for personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule by an  employee. An employee may adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation  rule for a vehicle only if the rule is adopted (A) by the employer and  (B) with respect to the first period in which the vehicle for which the  employer (consistent with paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section) adopted  the rule is available to that employee for personal use or, if the  commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used by  both the employer and the employee when the vehicle is first used by an  employee for personal use, the first period in which the commuting  valuation rule is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An employee must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule  for all subsequent periods. Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation  rule has been adopted for a vehicle by an employee, the rule must be  used by the employee for all subsequent periods of personal use of the  vehicle by the employee for which the rule is used by the employer,  except that the employee may, for any period during which use of the  vehicle qualifies for use of the commuting valuation rule of paragraph  (f) of this section and for which such rule is used by the employer, use  the commuting valuation rule with respect to the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Replacement vehicles. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph  (e)(5) to the contrary, if the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule is  used by an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect to  a particular vehicle, and a replacement vehicle is provided to the  employee for the primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the  employer, or the employer and the employee, using the rule must continue  to use the rule with respect to the replacement vehicle if the  replacement vehicle qualifies for use of the rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Commuting valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under the commuting  valuation rule of this paragraph (f), the value of the commuting use of  an employer-provided vehicle may be determined pursuant to paragraph  (f)(3) of this section if the following criteria are met by the employer  and employees with respect to the vehicle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided  to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade  or business and is used in the employer's trade or business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer  requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The employer has established a written policy under which the  employee may not use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for  commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal  errand on the way between a business delivery and the employee's home);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except for de minimis personal use, the employee does not use  the vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a  control employee of the employer (as defined in paragraphs (f) (5) and  (6) of this section).  If the vehicle is a chauffeur-driven vehicle, the commuting valuation  rule of this paragraph (f) may not be used to value the commuting use of  any passenger who commutes in the vehicle. The rule may be used,  however, to value the commuting use of the chauffeur. Personal use of a  vehicle is all use of the vehicle by the employee that is not used in  the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (f)(1) of  this section to the contrary, the following special rules apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Written policy not required in 1985. The policy described in  paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section prohibiting personal use need not  be written with respect to the commuting use which occurs prior to  January 1, 1986;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commuting use during 1985. For commuting use that occurs after  December 31, 1984, but before January 1, 1986, the restrictions of  paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section shall be applied by substituting  ``an employee who is   an officer or a five-percent owner of the employer'' in lieu of ``a  control employee''. For purposes of determining who is a five-percent  owner, any individual who owns (or is considered as owning) five or more  percent of the fair market value of an entity (the ``owned entity'') is  considered a five-percent owner of all entities that would be aggregated  with the owned entity under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), or (m).  An employee who is an officer of an employer shall be treated as an  officer of all entities treated as a single employer pursuant to section  414 (b), (c), or (m). The definitions provided in paragraphs (f)(5)(i)  and (f)(6) of this section may be used to define an officer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Control employee exception. If the vehicle in which the  employee is required to commute is not an automobile as defined in  paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the restrictions of paragraph  (f)(1)(v) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commuting value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $1.50 per one-way commute. If the  requirements of this paragraph (f) are satisfied, the value of the  commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle is $1.50 per one-way  commute (e.g., from home to work or from work to home).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Value per employee. If there is more than one employee who  commutes in the vehicle, such as in the case of an employer-sponsored  car pool, the amount includible in the income of each employee is $1.50  per one-way commute. Thus, the amount includible for each round-trip  commute is $3.00 per employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definition of vehicle. For purposes of this paragraph (f), the  term ``vehicle'' means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured  primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term  ``vehicle'' includes an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Control employee defined--Non-government employer. For purposes  of this paragraph (f), a control employee of a non-government employer  is any employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Who is a Board- or shareholder-appointed, confirmed, or elected  officer of the employer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Who is a director of the employer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, any individual who owns (or is considered  as owning under section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a)  for entities other than corporations) one percent or more of the fair  market value of an entity (the ``owned entity'') is considered a one- percent owner of all entities which would be aggregated with the owned  entity under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), or (m). An employee who  is an officer of an employer shall be treated as an officer of all  entities treated as a single employer pursuant to section 414 (b), (c)  or (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Control employee defined--Government employer. For purposes of  this paragraph (f), a control employee of a government employer if any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elected official,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federal employee who is appointed by the President and  confirmed by the Senate.

For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term ``government'' includes any  Federal, state, or local governmental unit, and any agency or  instrumentality thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Non-commercial flight valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under the  non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g), if an  employee is provided with a flight on an employer-provided aircraft, the  value of the flight is calculated using the aircraft valuation formula  provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. Except as otherwise  provided, for purposes of this paragraph (g), a flight provided to a  person whose flight would be taxable to an employee as the recipient is  referred to as provided to the employee, and a flight   taken by such person is considered a flight taken by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible flights and eligible aircraft. The valuation rule of  this paragraph (g) may be used to value flights on all employer-provided  aircraft, including helicopters. The valuation rule of this paragraph  (g) may be used to value international as well as domestic flights. The  valuation rule of this paragraph (g) may not be used to value a flight  on any commercial aircraft on which air transportation is sold to the  public on a per-seat basis. For a special valuation rule relating to  certain flights on commercial aircraft, see paragraph (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of a flight--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to  intermediate stops), for purposes of this paragraph (g), an individual's  flight is the distance (in statute miles) between the place at which the  individual boards the aircraft and the place at which the individual  deplanes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Valuation of each flight. Under the valuation rule of this  paragraph (g), value is determined separately for each flight. Thus, a  round-trip is comprised of at least two flights. For example, an  employee who takes a personal trip on an employer-provided aircraft from  New York, New York to Denver, Colorado, Denver to Los Angeles,  California, and Los Angeles to New York has taken three flights and must  apply the aircraft valuation formula separately to each flight. The  value of a flight must be determined on a passenger-by-passenger basis.  For example, if an individual accompanies an employee and the flight  taken by the individual would be taxed to the employee, the employee  would be taxed on the special rule value of the flight by the employee  and by the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Intermediate stop. If the primary purpose of a landing is  necessitated by weather conditions, by an emergency, for purposes of  refueling or obtaining other services relating to the aircraft, or for  purposes of the employer's business unrelated to the employee whose  flight is being valued (``an intermediate stop''), the distance between  the place at which the trip originates and the place at which the  intermediate stop occurs is not considered a flight. For example, assume  that an employee's trip originates in St. Louis, Missouri, on route to  Seattle, Washington, but, because of weather conditions, the aircraft  lands in Denver, Colorado, and the employee stays in Denver overnight.  Assume further that the next day the aircraft flies to Seattle where the  employee deplanes. The employee's flight is the distance between the  airport in St. Louis and the airport in Seattle. Assume that a trip  originates in New York, New York, with five passengers and makes an  intermediate stop in Chicago, Illinois, before going on to Los Angeles,  California. If one of the five passengers deplanes in Chicago, the  distance of that passenger's flight would be the distance between the  airport in New York and the airport in Chicago. The intermediate stop is  disregarded when measuring the flights taken by each of the other  passengers. Their flights would be the distance between the airport in  New York and the airport in Los Angeles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Personal and non-personal flights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The valuation  rule of this paragraph (g) applies to personal flights on employer- provided aircraft. A personal flight is one the value of which is not  excludable under another section of subtitle A, such as under section  132(d) (relating to a working condition fringe). However, solely for  purposes of paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) of this section,  references to personal flights do not include flights a portion of which  would not be excludable by reason of section 274.(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trip primarily for employer's business. If an employee  combines, in one trip, personal and business flights on an employer- provided aircraft and the employee's trip is primarily for the  employer's business (see Sec. 1.162-2(b)(2)), the employee must include  in income the excess of the value of all the flights that comprise the  trip over the value of the flights that would have been taken had there  been no personal flights but only business flights. For example, assume  that an employee flies on an employer-provided aircraft from Chicago,  Illinois to Miami, Florida, for the employer's business and that from  Miami the employee flies on the employer-provided aircraft to Orlando,  Florida,   for personal purposes and then flies back to Chicago. Assume further  that the primary purpose of the trip is for the employer's business. The  amount includible in income is the excess of the value of the three  flights (Chicago to Miami, Miami to Orlando, and Orlando to Chicago),  over the value of the flights that would have been taken had there been  no personal flights but only business flights (Chicago to Miami and  Miami to Chicago).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Primarily personal trip. In an employee combines, in one trip,  personal and business flights on an employer-provided aircraft and the  aircraft's trip is primarily personal (see Sec. 1.162-2(b)(2)), the  amount includible in the employee's income is the value of the personal  flights that would have been taken had there been no business flights  but only personal flights. For example, assume that an employee flies on  an employer-provided aircraft from San Francisco, California, to Los  Angeles, California, for the employer's business and that from Los  Angeles the employee flies on an employer-provided aircraft to Palm  Springs, California, primarily for personal reasons and then flies back  to San Francisco. Assume further that the primary purpose of the trip is  personal. The amount includible in the employee's income is the value of  personal flights that would have been taken had there been no business  flights but only personal flights (San Francisco to Palm Springs and  Palm Springs to San Francisco).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Application of section 274(c). The value of employer-provided  travel outside the United States away from home may not be excluded from  the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe, by either the  employer or the employee, to the extent not deductible by reason of  section 274(c). The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) applies to that  portion of the value of any flight not excludable by reason of section  274(c). Such value must be included in income in addition to the amounts  determined under paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Flight by individuals who are not personal guests. If an  individual who is not an employee of the employer providing the aircraft  is on a flight, and the individual is not the personal guest of any  employee, the flight by the individual is not taxable to any employee of  the employer providing the aircraft. The rule in the preceding sentence  applies where the individual is provided the flight by the employer for  noncompensatory business reasons of the employer. For example, assume  that G, and employee of company Y, accompanies A, an employee of company  X, on company X's aircraft for the purpose of inspecting land under  consideration for purchase by company X from company Y. The flight by G  is not taxable to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Aircraft valuation formula. Under the valuation rule of this  paragraph (g), the value of a flight is determined by multiplying the  base aircraft valuation formula for the period during which the flight  was taken by the appropriate aircraft multiple (as provided in paragraph  (g)(7) of this section) and then adding the applicable terminal charge.  The base aircraft valuation formula (also known as the Standard Industry  Fare Level formula or SIFL) in effect on June 30, 1985, is as follows:  ($.1402 per mile for the first 500 miles, $.1069 per mile for miles  between 501 and 1500, and $.1028 per mile for miles over 1500). The  terminal charge in effect on June 30, 1985, is $25.62. The SIFL cents- per-mile rates in the formula and the terminal charge are calculated by  the Department of Transportation and are revised semi-annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> SIFL formula in effect for a particular flight. For purposes of  this paragraph (g), in determining the value of a particular flight  during the first six months of a calendar year, the SIFL formula (and  terminal charge) in effect on December 31 of the preceding year applies,  and in determining the value of a particular flight during the last six  months of a calendar year, the SIFL formula (and terminal charge) in  effect on June 30 of that year applies. The following is the SIFL  formula in effect on December 31, 1984: ($.1480 per mile for the first  500 miles, $.1128 per mile for miles between 501 and 1500, and $.1085  per mile for miles over 1500). The terminal charge in effect on December  31, 1984, is $27.05.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Aircraft multiples--(i) In general. The aircraft multiples are  based on the maximum certified takeoff weight of   the aircraft. For purposes of applying the aircraft valuation formula  described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the aircraft multiples  are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">[In percent] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Aircraft multiple</p><p class="depth0">for a--</p><p class="depth0">---------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum certified takeoff weight of the aircraft                 Non-</p><p class="depth0">Control    control</p><p class="depth0">employee   employee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6,000 lbs. or less................................       62.5       15.6 6,001 to 10,000 lbs...............................      125.0       23.4 10,001 to 25,000 lbs..............................      300.0       31.3 25,001 lbs. or more...............................      400.0       31.3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flights treated as provided a to control employee. Except as  provided in paragraph (g)(10) of this section, any flight provided to an  individual whose flight would be taxable to a control employee (as  defined in paragraph (g)(8) and (9) of this section) as the recipient  shall be valued as if such flight has been provided to that control  employee. For example, assume that the chief executive officer of an  employer, his spouse, and his two children fly on an employer-provided  aircraft for personal purposes. Assume further that the maximum  certified takeoff weight of the aircraft is 12,000 lbs. The amount  includible in the employee's income is 4 x ((300 percent x base aircraft  valuation formula) plus the applicable terminal charge).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Control employee defined--Nongovernment employer. For purposes  of this paragraph (g), a control employee of a non-government employer  is any employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Who is a Board- or shareholder- appointed, confirmed, or elected  officer of the employer, limited to the lesser of (A) one-percent of all  employees (increased to the next highest integer, if not an integer) or  (B) ten employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whose compensation equals or exceeds the compensation of the  top one percent most highly-paid employees of the employer (increased to  the next highest integer, if not an integer) limited to a maximum of 25  employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Who owns a ten-percent or greater equity, capital or profits  interest in the employer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this section. For example, an  employee may be both an officer under paragraph (g)(8)(i) of this  section and a highly-paid employee under paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this  section. In this case, for purposes of the officer limitation rule of  paragraph (g)(8)(i) of this section and the highly-paid employee  limitation rule of paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section, the employee  would be counted as reducing both such limitation rules. In no event  shall an employee whose compensation is less than $50,000 be a control  employee under paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section. For purposes of  determining who is a ten-percent owner under paragraph (g)(8)(iii) of  this section, any individual who owns (or is considered as owning under  section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a) for entities  other than corporations) ten percent or more of the fair market value of  an entity (the ``owned entity'') is considered a ten-percent owner of  all entities which would be aggregated with the owned entity under the  rules of section 414 (b), (c), or (m). For purposes of determining who  is an officer under paragraph (g)(8)(i) of this section, notwithstanding  anything in this section to the contrary, if the employer would be  aggregated with other employers under the rules of section 414 (b), (c),  or (m), the officer definition and the limitations are applied to each  separate employer rather than to the aggregated employer. If applicable,  the officer limitation rule of paragraph (g)(8)(i) of this section is  applied to employees in descending order of their compensation. Thus, if  an employer has 11 board-appointed officers, the employee with the least  compensation of those officers would not be an officer under paragraph  (g)(8)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term  ``compensation'' means the amount reported on a Form W-2 as income for  the   prior calendar year. Compensation includes all amounts received from all  entities treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), or  (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Control employee defined--Government. For purposes of this  paragraph (g), a control employee of a government employer is any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elected officials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federal employee who is appointed by the President and  confirmed by the Senate. In the case of commissioned officers of the  United States Armed Forces, an officer is any individual with the rank  or brigadier general or above or the rank of rear admiral (lower half)  or above; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State or local executive officer comparable to the individuals  in paragraph (g)(9)(i) and (ii) of this section.  For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term ``government'' includes any  Federal, state, or local government unit, and any agency or  instrumentality thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Seating capacity rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Where 50 percent of more  of the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft (as used by the  employer) is occupied by individuals whose flights are primarily for the  employer's business (and whose flights are excludable from income under  section 132(d)), the value of a flight on that aircraft by any employee  who is not flying primarily for the employer's business (or who is  flying primarily for the employer's business but the value of whose  flight is not excludable under section 132(d) by reason of section  274(c)) is deemed to be zero. See Sec. 1.132-5T which limits the  exclusion under section 132(d) to situations where the employee receives  the flight in connection with the performance of services for the  employer providing the aircraft. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(10),  the term ``employee'' includes only employees and partners of the  employer providing the aircraft and does not include independent  contractors and directors of the employer.  For purposes of this paragraph (g)(10), the second sentence of paragraph  (g)(1) of this section will not apply. Instead, a flight taken by an  individual who is either treated as an employee pursuant to section  132(f)(1) or whose flight is treated as a flight taken by an employee  pursuant to section 132(f)(2) is considered a flight taken by an  employee. If (A) a flight is considered taken by an individual other  than an employee (as defined in this paragraph (g)(10)), (B) the value  of that individual's flight is not excludable under section 132(d), and  (C) the seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(10) otherwise  applies, then the value of the flight provided to such an individual is  the value of a flight provided to a non-control employee (even if the  individual who would be taxed on the value of such individual's flight  is a control employee).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of 50-percent test to multiple flights. The seating  capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(10) must be met both at the time the  individual whose flight is being valued boards the aircraft and at the  time the individual deplanes. For example, assume that employee A boards  an employer-provided aircraft for personal purposes in New York, New  York, and that at that time 80 percent of the regular passenger seating  capacity of the aircraft is occupied by individuals whose flights are  primarily for the employer's business (and whose flights are excludable  from income under section 132(d)) (``the business passengers''). If the  aircraft flies directly to Hartford, Connecticut where all of the  passengers, including A, deplane, the requirements of the seating  capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(10) have been satisfied. If instead,  some of the passengers, including A, remain on the aircraft in Hartford  and the aircraft continues on to Boston, Massachusetts, where they all  deplane, the requirements of the seating capacity rule of this paragraph  (g)(10) will not be satisfied unless at least 50 percent of the seats  comprising the aircraft's regular passenger seating capacity were  occupied by the business passengers at the time A deplanes in Boston.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Regular passenger seating capacity. The regular passenger  seating capacity of an aircraft is the maximum number of seats that have  at any time been on the aircraft (while owned or leased by the  employer). Except to the extent excluded pursuant to paragraph  (g)(10)(v) of this section, regular seating capacity includes all seats  which   may be occupied by members of the flight crew. It is irrelevant that on  a particular flight, less than the maximum number of seats are available  for use, because, for example, some of the seats are removed. When  determining the maximum number of seats, those seats that cannot at any  time be legally used during takeoff and are not any time used during  takeoff are not counted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (g)(10)(iii) of this section  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer A and employer B order the same aircraft, except  that A orders it with 10 seats and B orders it with eight seats. A  always uses its aircraft as a 10-seat aircraft; B always uses its  aircraft as an eight-seat aircraft. The regular passenger seating  capacity of A's aircraft is 10 and of B's aircraft is eight.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that  whenever A's chief executive officer and spouse use the aircraft eight  seats are removed. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraft  is by the chief executive officer and spouse the regular passenger  seating capacity of the aircraft is 10.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that  whenever more than eight people want to fly in B's aircraft, two extra  seats are added. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraft  occurs with eight seats, the regular passenger seating capacity of the  aircraft is 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, the regular passenger seating capacity of an  aircraft is two seats.   Assume further that an employee pilots the aircraft and that the  employee's flight is not primarily for the employer's business. If the  employee's spouse occupies the other seat for personal purposes, the  seating capacity rule is not met and the value of both flights must be  included in the employee's income. If, however, the employee's flight  were primarily for the employer's business (unrelated to serving as a  member of the flight crew), then the seating capacity rule is met and  the value of the flight for the employee's spouse is deemed to be zero.  If the employee's flight were primarily to serve as a member of the  flight crew, then the seating capacity rule is not met and the value of  a flight by any passenger for primarily personal reasons is not deemed  to be zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Erroneous use of the non-commercial flight valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. If the non-commercial flight valuation rule of this  paragraph (g) is used by an employer or a control employee, as the case  may be, on a return as originally filed, on the grounds that either the  control employee is not in fact a control employee, or that the aircraft  is within a specific weight classification, and either position is  subsequently determined to be erroneous, the valuation rule of this  paragraph (g) (including paragraph (g)(13) of this section) is not  available to value the flight taken by that control employee by the  person or persons taking the erroneous position. With respect to the  weight classifications, the previous sentence does not apply if the  position taken is that the weight of the aircraft is greater than it is  subsequently determined to be. If, with respect to a flight by a control  employee, the seating capacity rule of paragraph (g)(10) of this section  is used by an employer or the control employee, as the case may be, on a  return as originally filed, and it is subsequently determined that the  requirements of paragraph (g)(10) of this section were not met, the  valuation rule of this paragraph (g) (including paragraph (g)(13) of  this section) is not available to value the flight taken by that control  employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Value of flight excluded as a working condition fringe. If  either an employer or an employee, on a return as   originally filed, excludes from the employee's income or wages the value  of a flight on the grounds that the flight was excludable as a working  condition fringe under section 132, and that position is subsequently  determined to be erroneous, the valuation rule of this paragraph (g)  (including paragraph (g)(13) of this section) is not available to value  the flight taken by that employee by the person or persons taking the  erroneous position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Consistency rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use by the employer. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraphs (g)(11) and (g)(13)(iv) of this section, if the  non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an  employer to value flights provided in a calendar year, the rule must be  used to value all flights provided in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by the employee. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs  (g)(11) and (g)(13)(iv) of this section, if the non-commercial flight  valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an employee to value a  flight taken in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all  flights taken in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Transitional valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the value of a  flight determined under this paragraph (g)(13) is lower than the value  of the flight otherwise determined under paragraph (g) of this section,  the value of the flight is the lower amount. The transitional valuation  rule of this paragraph (g)(13) is available only for flights provided  after December 31, 1984, and before January 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional valuation rule aircraft multiples. The appropriate  aircraft multiples under the transitional valuation rule are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 125 percent of the base aircraft valuation formula, plus the  applicable terminal charge, for any flight by any employee who is not a  key employee (as defined in paragraph (g)(13)(iii) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, entertaining an employee or other  individual is not a business purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 600 percent of the base aircraft valuation formula, plus the  applicable terminal charge, for a flight by a key employee if there is  not primary business for the trip by the aircraft.   Where there is no business purpose for the trip by the aircraft, the  alternative valuation rule may not be used to value a flight by a key  employee. For purposes of this section, compensating an employee is not  a business purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Key employee defined. A ``key employee'' is any employee who  is a five-percent owner or an officer of the employer, or who, with  respect to a particular trip by the aircraft, controls the use of the  aircraft. For purposes of determining who is a five-percent owner, any  individual who owns (or is considered as owning) five or more percent of  the fair market value of an entity (the ``owned entity'') is considered  a five-percent owner of all entities that would be aggregated with the  owned entity under the rules of section 414(b), (c), or (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Erroneous use of transitional valuation rule. If the  transitional valuation rule is used by an employer or a key employee, as  the case may be, on a return as originally filed, on the grounds that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The key employee is not in fact a key employee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An aircraft trip had a primary business purpose, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An aircraft trip had some business purpose,  and such position is subsequently determined to be erroneous, neither  the transitional valuation rule nor the non-commercial flight valuation  rule of this paragraph (g) is available to value such flight taken by  that key employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous  position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Commercial flight valuation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under the  commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h), the value of a  space-available flight (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section)  on a commercial aircraft is 25 percent of the actual carrier's highest  unrestricted coach fare in effect for the particular flight taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Space-available flight. The commercial flight valuation rule of  this paragraph (h) is available to value a space-available flight. The  term   ``space-available flight'' means a flight on a commercial aircraft (i)  for which the airline (the acutal carrier) incurs no substantial  additional cost (including forgone revenue) determined without regard to  any amount paid for the flight and (ii) which is subject to the same  types of restrictions customarily associated with flying on an employee  ``standby'' or ``space-available'' basis. A flight may be a space- available flight even if the airline that is the actual carrier is not  the employer of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commercial aircraft. If the actual carrier does not offer, in  the ordinary course of its business, air transportation to customers on  a per-seat basis, the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph  (h) is not available. Thus, if, in the ordinary course of its line of  business, the employer only offers air transportation to customers on a  charter basis, the commerical flight valuation rule of this paragraph  (h) may not be used to value a space-available flight on the employer's  aircraft. Similarly, if, in the ordinary course of its line of business,  an employer only offers air transportation to customers for the  transport of cargo, the commercial flight valuation rule of this  paragraph (h) may not be used to value a space-available flight on the  employer's aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Timing of inclusion. The date that the flight is taken is the  relevant date for purposes of applying section 61(a)(1) and this section  to a space-available flight on a commercial aircraft. The date of  purchase or issuance of a pass or ticket is not relevant. Thus, this  section applies to a flight taken on or after January 1, 1985,  regardless of the date on which the pass or ticket for the flight was  purchased or issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consistency rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use by employer. If the commercial flight  valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is used by an employer to value  flights provided in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all  flights provided in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by employee. If the commercial flight valuation rule of  this paragraph (h) is used by an employee to value a flight taken in a  calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights taken by such  employee in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Valuation of meals provided at an employer-operated eating  facility for employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The valuation rule of this  paragraph (j) may be used to value a meal provided at an employer- operated eating facility for employees (as defined in Sec. 1.132-7T).  For rules relating to an exclusion for the value of meals provided at an  employer-operated eating facility for employees, see Sec. 1.132-7T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Valuation formula--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The value of all meals  provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees during a  calendar year is 150 percent of the direct operating costs of the eating  facility (``total meal value''). For purposes of this paragraph (j), the  definition of direct operating costs provided in Sec. 1.132-7T applies.  The taxable value of meals provided at an eating facility may be  determined in two ways. The ``individual meal subsidy'' may be treated  as the taxable value of a meal provided at the eating facility (see  paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section). Alternatively, the employer may  allocate the ``total meal subsidy'' among employees (see paragraph  (j)(2)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Individual meal subsidy'' defined. The ``individual meal  subsidy'' is determined by multiplying the price charged for a  particular meal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total meal  value and the denominator of which is the gross receipts of the eating  facility, and then subtracting the amount paid for the meal. The taxable  value of meals provided to a particular employee during a calendar year,  therefore, is the sum of the individual meal subsidies provided to the  employee during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of ``total meal subsidy.'' Instead of using the  individual meal value method, the employer may allocate the ``total meal  subsidy'' (total meal value less the gross receipts of the facility)  among employees in any manner reasonable under the circumstances.
