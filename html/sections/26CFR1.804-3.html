                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gross investment income defined. For purposes of part I,  subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 804(b) defines the term  gross investment income of a life insurance company as the sum of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gross amount of income from:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest (including tax-exempt interest and partially tax-exempt  interest), as described in Sec. 1.61-7. Interest shall be adjusted for  amortization of premium and accrual of discount in accordance with the  rules prescribed in section 818(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dividends, as described in Sec. 1.61-9.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rents and royalties, as described in Sec. 1.61-8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The entering into of any lease, mortgage, or other instrument  or agreement from which the life insurance company may derive interest,  rents, or royalties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The alteration or termination of any instrument or agreement  described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.  For example, gross investment income includes amounts received as  commitment fees, as a bonus for the entering into of a lease, or as a  penalty for the early payment of a mortgage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958,  the amount (if any) by which the net short-term capital gain (as defined  in section 1222(5)) exceeds the net long-term capital loss (as defined  in section 1222(8)), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gross income from any trade or business (other than an  insurance   business) carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership  of which the life insurance company is a partner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and  paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exclusion of net long-term capital gains. Any net long-term  capital gains from the sale or exchange of a capital asset (or any gain  considered to be from the sale or exchange of a capital asset under  applicable law) shall be excluded from the gross investment income of a  life insurance company. However, section 804(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)  of this section provide that the amount (if any) by which the net short- term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss shall be  included in the gross investment income of a life insurance company.
