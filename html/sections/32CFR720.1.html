                            <p class="depth0">Subpart A of this part deals with requests by State authorities for  the surrender of members or civilians pursuant to arrest warrants or  similar process, generally in connection with a criminal prosecution.  Responding to such requests by a State for delivery of members or  civilian employees involves balancing the Federal interest in preserving  sovereign immunity and the productivity, peace, good order, and  discipline of the installation against the right of the State to  exercise its jurisdiction. Additionally, by regulation, naval and Marine  authorities are limited in the extent to which they can directly assist  such an act. Commands should respond to such requests as set out below,  generally using the minimum authority necessary to preserve the Federal  interests without unduly restricting State jurisdiction.</p>
