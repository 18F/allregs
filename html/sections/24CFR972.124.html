                            <p class="depth0">The development, or portions thereof, must be converted if it is a  general occupancy development of 250 or more dwelling units and it meets  the following criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The development is on the same or contiguous sites. This refers  to the actual number and location of units, irrespective of HUD  development project numbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The development has a vacancy rate of at least a specified  percent for dwelling units not in funded, on-schedule modernization, for  each of the last three years, and the vacancy rate has not significantly  decreased in those three years. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a conversion analysis performed  on or before March 16, 2009, the specified vacancy rate is 15 percent.  For a conversion analysis performed after that date, the specified  vacancy rate is 12 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the determination of vacancy rates, the PHA must use the  data it relied upon for the PHA's latest Public Housing Assessment  System (PHAS) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (report  on Occupancy). Units in the following categories must not be included in  this calculation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but  only if state law requires the property to be left in the unit for some  period of time, and only for the period of time stated in the law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only  until the insurance claim is adjusted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that  are used for resident services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Units that HUD determines, in its sole discretion, are  intentionally vacant and do not indicate continued distress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The development either is distressed housing for which the PHA  cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing, or more  expensive for the PHA to operate as public housing than providing  tenant-based assistance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The development is distressed housing for  which the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing  through reasonable revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of  a broader range of household income. (See Sec. 972.127)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this section will be assumed to be ``distressed,'' unless HUD  determines that the reasons a property meets such standards are  temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A development satisfies the long-term viability test only if it  is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least 20 years (or  at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the  development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy;  will not be excessively densely configured relative to other similar  rental (typically family) housing in the community; can achieve a  broader range of family income; and has no other site impairments that  clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The development is more expensive for the PHA to operate as  public housing than to provide tenant-based assistance if it has an  estimated cost, during the remaining useful life of the project, of  continued operation and modernization of the development as public  housing in excess of the cost of providing tenant-based assistance under  section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for all families in  occupancy, based on appropriate indicators of cost (such as the  percentage of total development cost required for modernization).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this determination, the costs used for public  housing must be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as  described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization  costs, and accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost  of continuing the development as public housing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared  to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The cost methodology necessary to conduct the cost comparisons  for required conversions has not yet been finalized. PHAs are not  required to undertake conversions under this subpart until six months  after the effective date of the cost methodology, which will be  announced in the Federal Register. Once effective, the cost methodology  will be codified as an appendix to this part.</p>
