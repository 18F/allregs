                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a).)</em> The Agency may have appraisal requirements that  supplement these requirements, including, to the extent appropriate, the  Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition (UASFLA). \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).  Published by The Appraisal Foundation, a nonprofit educational  organization. Copies may be ordered from The Appraisal Foundation at the  following URL: http://www.appraisalfoundation.org/htm/USPAP2004/toc.htm.</p><p class="depth2">\2\ The ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land  Acquisitions'' is published by the Interagency Land Acquisition  Conference. It is a compendium of Federal eminent domain appraisal law,  both case and statute, regulations and practices. It is available at  http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/toc.htm or in soft cover format from  the Appraisal Institute at http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/econom/ publications/Default.asp and select ``Legal/Regulatory'' or call 888- 570-4545. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency acquiring real property has a legitimate role in  contributing to the appraisal process, especially in developing the  scope of work and defining the appraisal problem. The scope of work and  development of an appraisal under these requirements depends on the  complexity of the appraisal problem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency has the responsibility to assure that the appraisals  it obtains are relevant to its program needs, reflect established and  commonly accepted Federal and federally-assisted program appraisal  practice, and as a minimum, complies with the definition of appraisal in  Sec. 24.2(a)(3) and the five following requirements: (See appendix A,  Sec. Sec. 24.103 and 24.103(a).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An adequate description of the physical characteristics of the  property being appraised (and, in the case of a partial acquisition, an  adequate description of the remaining property), including items  identified as personal property, a statement of the known and observed  encumbrances, if any, title information, location, zoning, present use,  an analysis of highest and best use, and at least a 5-year sales history  of the property. (See appendix A, Sec. 24.103(a)(1).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All relevant and reliable approaches to value consistent with  established Federal and federally-assisted program appraisal practices.  If the appraiser uses more than one approach, there shall be an analysis  and reconciliation of approaches to value used that is sufficient to  support the appraiser's opinion of value. (See appendix A, Sec.  24.103(a).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of comparable sales, including a description of  all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to  the transaction, source and method of financing, and verification by a  party involved in the transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement of the value of the real property to be acquired  and, for a partial acquisition, a statement of the value of the damages  and benefits, if any, to the remaining real property, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The effective date of valuation, date of appraisal, signature,  and certification of the appraiser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b).)</em></p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Owner retention of improvements. If the owner of a real property  improvement is permitted to retain it for removal from the project site,  the amount to be offered for the interest in the real property to be  acquired shall be not less than the difference between the amount  determined to be just compensation for the owner's entire interest in  the real property and the salvage value (defined at Sec. 24.2(a)(24))  of the retained improvement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1).)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency uses a contract (fee) appraiser to perform the  appraisal, such appraiser shall be State licensed or certified in  accordance with title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,  and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.).
