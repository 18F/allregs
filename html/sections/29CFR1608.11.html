                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No determination of adequacy of plan or program. These  Guidelines are applicable only with respect to the circumstances  described in Sec. 1608.1(d), of this part. They do not apply to, and  the section 713(b)(1) defense is not available for the purpose of,  determining the adequacy of an affirmative action plan or program to  eliminate discrimination. Whether an employer who takes such affirmative  action has done enough to remedy such discrimination will remain a  question of fact in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Guidelines inapplicable in absence of affirmative action. Where  an affirmative action plan or program does not exist, or where the plan  or program is not the basis of the action complained of, these  Guidelines are inapplicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Currency of plan or program. Under section 713(b)(1), persons  may rely on the plan or program only during the time when it is current.  Currency is related to such factors as progress in correcting the  conditions disclosed by the self analysis. The currency of the plan or  program is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis.  Programs developed under Executive Order 11246, as amended, will be  deemed current in accordance with Department of Labor regulations at 41  CFR chapter 60, or successor orders or regulations.</p>
