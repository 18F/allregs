(i) The owner or operator of an OCS source shall submit to the Administrator or delegated agency all information necessary to perform any analysis or make any determination required under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any application submitted pursuant to this part by an OCS source shall include a description of all the requirements of this part and a description of how the source will comply with the applicable requirements. For identification purposes only, the application shall include a description of those requirements that have been proposed by EPA for incorporation into this part and that the applicant believes, after diligent research and inquiry, apply to the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemptions. (i) When an applicant submits any approval to construct or permit to operate application to the Administrator or delegated agency it shall include a request for exemption from compliance with any pollution control technology requirement that the applicant believes is technically infeasible or will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety. The Administrator or delegated agency shall act on the request for exemption in accordance with the procedures established in Sec. 55.7 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A final permit shall not be issued under this part until a final determination is made on any exemption request, including those appealed to the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 55.7 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative procedures and public participation. The Administrator will follow the applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications under this part.

(i) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates an OCS source not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this part 55, or with any approval to construct or permit to operate, or any owner or operator of a source subject to the requirements of this part who commences construction after the effective date of this part without applying for and receiving approval under this part, shall be in violation of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any owner or operator of a new OCS source who commenced construction prior to the promulgation date of this rule shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Receipt of an approval to construct or a permit to operate from the Administrator or delegated agency shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with the applicable provisions of any other requirements under Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator of an OCS source to whom the approval to construct or permit to operate is issued under this part shall notify all other owners and operators, contractors, and the subsequent owners and operators associated with emissions from the source, of the conditions of the permit issued under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Delegation of authority. If the Administrator delegates any of the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of this section, the following provisions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant shall send a copy of any permit application required by this section to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office at the same time as the application is submitted to the delegated agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The delegated agency shall send a copy of any public comment notice required under this section or Secs. 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The delegated agency shall send a copy of any preliminary determination and final permit action required under this section or Secs. 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office at the time of the determination and shall make available to the Administrator any materials used in making the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preconstruction requirements for OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries.

begin actual construction after the effective date of this part without a permit that requires the OCS source to meet those requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any permit application required under this part shall not be submitted until the Administrator has determined whether a consistency update is necessary, pursuant to Sec. 55.12 of this part, and, if the Administrator finds an update to be necessary, has published a proposed consistency update.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant may be required to obtain more than one preconstruction permit, if necessitated by partial delegation of this part or by the requirements of this section and Secs. 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The 18-month period may be extended upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator or the delegated agency that an extension is justified. Sources obtaining extensions are subject to all new or interim requirements and a reassessment of the applicable control technology when the extension is granted. This requirement shall not supersede a more stringent requirement under Secs. 55.13 or 55.14 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any preconstruction permit issued to a new OCS source or modification shall remain in effect until it expires under paragraph (b)(4) of this section or is rescinded under the applicable requirements incorporated in Secs. 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Whenever any proposed OCS source or modification to an existing OCS source is subject to action by a Federal agency that might necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated with the environmental reviews under that Act to the extent feasible and reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The Administrator or delegated agency and the applicant shall provide written notice of any permit application from a source, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within the Class I area.

The applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 71 will be implemented and enforced by the Administrator. The Administrator may delegate the authority to implement and enforce all or part of a Federal operating permits program to a State pursuant to Sec. 55.11 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Permit requirements for sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. (1) OCS sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries shall be subject to the permitting requirements set forth in this section and Sec. 55.13 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator or delegated agency shall not issue a permit-to-operate to any existing OCS source that has not demonstrated compliance with all the applicable requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Permit requirements for new sources that commenced construction prior to September 4, 1992--(1) Applicability.
