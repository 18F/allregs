                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 538.273(b)(1), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Modifications (Federal Supply Schedule) (MAY 16, 2014)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reporting of Federal Supply Schedule Sales. The Contractor shall report all contract sales under this contract as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of all sales under this contract by calendar quarter (January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31). The dollar value of a sale is the price paid by the Schedule user for products and services on a Schedule task or delivery order. The reported contract sales value shall include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). The Contractor shall maintain a consistent accounting method of sales reporting, based on the Contractor's established commercial accounting practice. The acceptable points at which sales may be reported include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Receipt of order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shipment or delivery, as applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Issuance of an invoice; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contract sales shall be reported to FSS Federal Acquisition Services (FSS) within 30 calendar days following the completion of each reporting quarter. The Contractor shall continue to furnish quarterly reports, including ``zero'' sales, through physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reportable sales under the contract are those resulting from sales of contract items to authorized users unless the purchase was conducted pursuant to a separate contracting authority such as a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-FAR contract. Sales made to state and local governments under Cooperative Purchasing authority shall be counted as reportable sales for IFF purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall electronically report the quarterly dollar value of sales, including ``zero'' sales, by utilizing the automated reporting system at an Internet website designated by the General Services Administration (GSA)'s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). Prior to using this automated system, the Contractor shall complete contract registration with the FAS Vendor Support Center (VSC). The website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award. The Contractor shall report sales separately for each National Stock Number (NSN), Special Item Number (SIN), or sub-item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the ``Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange'' issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service. The Contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter. The report is available from Financial Management Service, International Funds Branch, Telephone: (202) 874-7994, Internet: http://www.fms.treas.gov/intn.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall remit the IFF at the rate set by GSA's FAS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall remit the IFF to FAS in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter; final payment shall be remitted within 30 days after physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IFF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales reported. This percentage is set at the discretion of GSA's FAS. GSA's FAS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but not more than once per year. FAS will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of the change. The IFF reimburses FAS for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program. FAS recoups its operating costs from ordering activities as set forth in 40 U.S.C. 321: Acquisition Services Fund. Net operating revenues generated by the IFF are also applied to fund initiatives benefitting other authorized FAS programs, in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 321. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FAS will post notice of the current IFF at https://72a.gsa.gov/ or successor Web site as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 60 days of award, an FAS representative will provide the Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting the IFF. FAS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). Should the Contractor fail to submit the required sales reports, falsify them, or fail to timely pay the IFF, this is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
