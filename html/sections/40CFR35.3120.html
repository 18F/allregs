                            <p class="depth0">The SRF may provide seven general types of financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loans. The SRF may award loans at or below market interest  rates, or for zero interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loans may be awarded only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All principal and interest payments on loans are credited  directly to the SRF;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The annual repayment of principal and payment of interest  begins not later than one year after project completion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loan is fully amortized not later than twenty years after  project completion; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each loan recipient establishes one or more dedicated sources  of revenue for repayment of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where construction of a treatment works has been phased or  segmented, loan repayment requirements apply to the completion of  individual phases or segments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refinancing existing debt obligations. The SRF may buy or  refinance local debt obligations at or below market rates, where the  initial debt was incurred after March 7, 1985, and building began after  that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Projects otherwise eligible for refinancing under this section  on which building began:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before January 28, 1988 (the effective date of the Initial  Guidance for State Revolving Funds) must meet the requirements of title  VI to be fully eligible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After January 28, 1988, but before the effective date of this  rule, must meet the requirements of title VI and of the Initial Guidance  for State Revolving Funds to be fully eligible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After March 19, 1990 must meet the requirements of this rule  to be fully eligible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the original debt for a project was in the form of a  multi-purpose bond incurred for purposes in addition to wastewater  treatment facility construction, an SRF may provide refinancing only for  eligible purposes, and not for the entire debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guarantee or purchase insurance for local debt obligations. The  SRF may guarantee local debt obligations where such action would improve  credit market access or reduce interest rates. The SRF may also purchase  or provide bond insurance to guarantee debt service payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guarantee SRF debt obligations. The SRF may be used as security  or as a source of revenue for the payment of principal and interest on  revenue or general obligation bonds issued by the State provided that  the net proceeds of the sale of such bonds are deposited in the SRF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loan guarantees for ``sub-State revolving funds.'' The SRF may  provide loan guarantees for similar revolving funds established by  municipal or intermunicipal agencies, to finance activities eligible  under title VI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Earn interest on fund accounts. The SRF may earn interest on  Fund accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> SRF administrative expenses. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Money in the SRF may be used  for the reasonable costs of administering the SRF, provided that the  amount does not exceed 4 percent of all grant awards received by the  SRF. Expenses of the SRF in excess of the amount permitted under this  section must be paid for from sources outside the SRF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allowable administrative costs include all reasonable costs  incurred for management of the SRF program and for management of  projects receiving financial assistance from the SRF. Reasonable costs  unique to the SRF, such as costs of servicing loans and issuing debt,  SRF program start-up costs, financial management, and legal consulting  fees, and reimbursement costs for support services from other State  agencies are also allowable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unallowable administrative costs include the costs of  administering the   construction grant program under section 205(g), permit programs under  sections 402 and 404 and Statewide wastewater management planning  programs under section 208(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expenses incurred issuing bonds guaranteed by the SRF, including  the costs of insuring the issue, may be absorbed by the proceeds of the  bonds, and need not be charged against the 4 percent administrative  costs ceiling. The net proceeds of those issues must be deposited in the  Fund.</p>
