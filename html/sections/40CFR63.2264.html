Submit with the Notification of Compliance Status the annual volume percentage of softwood species dried in the dryer based on your dryer production for the 12 months prior to the compliance date specified for your source in Sec. 63.2233. If you did not dry any softwood species in the dryer during the 12 months prior to the compliance date, then you need only to submit a statement indicating that no softwood species were dried. In addition, submit with the Notification of Compliance Status a signed statement by a responsible official that certifies with truth, accuracy, and completeness that the veneer dryer will be used to process less than 30 volume percent softwood species in the future.</p>
