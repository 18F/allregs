A person who applies for a Category II pilot  authorization must hold:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least a private or commercial pilot certificate with an  instrument rating or an airline transport pilot certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A type rating for the aircraft for which the authorization is  sought if that aircraft requires a type rating; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A category and class rating for the aircraft for which the  authorization is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Experience requirements. An applicant for a Category II pilot  authorization must have at least--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 50 hours of night flight time as pilot in command.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 75 hours of instrument time under actual or simulated instrument  conditions that may include not more than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A combination of 25 hours of simulated instrument flight time in  a flight simulator or flight training device; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 40 hours of simulated instrument flight time if accomplished in  an approved course conducted by an appropriately rated training center  certificated under part 142 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 250 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot in command.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Practical test requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A practical test must be passed  by a person who applies for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issuance or renewal of a Category II pilot authorization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The addition of another type aircraft to the applicant's  Category II pilot authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To be eligible for the practical test for an authorization under  this section, an applicant must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the applicant has not passed a practical test for this  authorization during the 12 calendar months preceding the month of the  test, then that person must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Meet the requirements of Sec. 61.57(c); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Have performed at least six ILS approaches during the 6 calendar  months preceding the month of the test, of which at least three of the  approaches must have been conducted without the use of an approach  coupler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The approaches specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this  section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Must be conducted under actual or simulated instrument flight  conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Must be conducted to the decision height for the ILS approach  in the type aircraft in which the practical test is to be conducted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Need not be conducted to the decision height authorized for  Category II operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Must be conducted to the decision height authorized for  Category II operations only if conducted in a flight simulator or flight  training device; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Must be accomplished in an aircraft of the same category and  class, and type, as applicable, as the aircraft in which the practical  test is to be conducted or in a flight simulator that--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Represents an aircraft of the same category and class, and type,  as applicable, as the aircraft in which the authorization is sought; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is used in accordance with an approved course conducted by a  training center certificated under part 142 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The flight time acquired in meeting the requirements of  paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section may be used to meet the  requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Practical test procedures. The practical test consists of an  oral increment and a flight increment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Oral increment. In the oral increment of the practical test an  applicant must demonstrate knowledge of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Required landing distance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recognition of the decision height;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Missed approach procedures and techniques using computed or  fixed attitude guidance displays;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use and limitations of RVR;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Use of visual clues, their availability or limitations, and  altitude at which they are normally discernible at reduced RVR readings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Procedures and techniques related to transition from nonvisual  to visual flight during a final approach under reduced RVR;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Effects of vertical and horizontal windshear;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Characteristics and limitations of the ILS and runway  lighting system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Characteristics and limitations of the flight director system,  auto approach coupler (including split axis type if equipped), auto  throttle system (if equipped), and other required Category II equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Assigned duties of the second in command during Category II  approaches, unless the aircraft for which authorization is sought does  not require a second in command; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Instrument and equipment failure warning systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flight increment.
