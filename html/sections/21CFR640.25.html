                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Storage. Immediately after resuspension, Platelets shall be  placed in storage at the selected temperature range. If stored at 20 to  24 [deg]C, a continuous gentle agitation of the platelet concentrate  shall be maintained throughout the storage period. Agitation is optional  if stored at a temperature between 1 and 6 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quality control testing. Each month four units prepared from  different donors shall be tested at the end of the storage period as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Platelet count.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> pH of not less than 6.2 measured at the storage temperature of  the unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measurement of actual plasma volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the results of the quality control testing indicate that the  product does not meet the prescribed requirements, immediate corrective  action shall be taken and a record maintained of such action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturing responsibility. All manufacturing of Platelets  shall be performed at the same licensed establishment, except that the  quality control testing under paragraph (b) of this section may be  performed by a clinical laboratory which meets the standards of the  Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (42 U.S.C.  263a) and is qualified to perform platelet counts. Such arrangements  must be approved by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and  Research, Food and Drug Administration. Such testing shall not be  considered as divided manufacturing, as described in Sec. 610.63 of  this chapter, provided the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The results of each test are received within 10 days of the  preparation of the platelet concentrate, and are maintained by the  establishment licensed for Platelets so that they may be reviewed by an  authorized representative of the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensed Platelets manufacturer has obtained a written  agreement that the testing laboratory will permit an authorized  representative of the Food and Drug Administration to inspect its  testing procedures and facilities during reasonable business hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The testing laboratory will participate in any proficiency  testing programs undertaken by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and  Research, Food and Drug Administration.
