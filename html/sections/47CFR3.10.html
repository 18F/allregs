                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicants must meet the requirements and conditions contained  in these rules in order to be certified as an accounting authority. No  individual or other entity, including accounting authorities approved by  other administrations, may act as a United States accounting authority  and settle accounts of U.S. licensed vessels in the maritime mobile or  maritime mobile-satellite services without a certification from the  Federal Communications Commission. Accounting authorities with interim  certification as of the effective date of this rule must submit to the  application process discussed in Sec. 3.20. They will be  ``grandfathered'', i.e, granted permanent certification provided they  demonstrate their eligibility and present a proper application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. citizenship is not required of individuals in order to  receive certification from the Commission to be an accounting authority.  Likewise, joint ventures need not be organized under the laws of the  United States in order to be eligible to perform settlements   for U.S. licensed vessels. See, however, Sec. 3.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior experience in maritime accounting, general commercial  accounting, international shipping or any other related endeavor will be  taken into consideration by the Commission in certifying accounting  authorities. The lack of such expertise, however, will not automatically  disqualify an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity from  becoming an accounting authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicants must provide formal financial statements or  documentation proving all assets, liabilities, income and expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicants must offer their services to any member of the public  making a reasonable request therefor, without undue discrimination  against any customer or class of customer, and fees charged for  providing such services shall be reasonable and non-discriminatory. This  requirement will be waived for applicants who settle their own accounts  only and are eligible to be ``grandfathered'' during the initial  application period. However, should the need for additional accounting  authorities be proven, these accounting authorities will be required to  offer their services to the public or relinquish their certification.
