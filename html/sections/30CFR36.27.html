(1) The fuel tank shall not leak and shall be fabricated of metal at least \1/16\ inch thick, welded at all seams, except that tanks of 5 gallons or less capacity may have thinner walls which shall be preformed or reinforced to provide good resistance to deflection. A drain plug (not a valve or petcock) shall be provided and locked in position. A vent opening shall be provided in the fuel filler cap of such design that atmospheric pressure is maintained inside the tank. The size of the vent opening shall be restricted to prevent fuel from splashing through it. The filler opening shall be so arranged that fuel can be added only through a self-closing valve at least 1 foot from the exhaust manifold of the engine, preferably below it. The self-closing valve shall constitute a fuel-tight closure when fuel is not being added. Any part of the self-closing valve that might become detached during the addition of fuel shall be secured to the tank by a chain or other fastening to prevent loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fuel tank shall not leak and shall be fabricated of metal at least \1/16\ inch thick, welded at all seams, except that tanks of 5 gallons or less capacity may have thinner walls which shall be preformed or reinforced to provide good resistance to deflection.
