                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform  Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, natural gas pipeline companies which  have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow  through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to  liberalized depreciation, to employ a normalization method for computing  Federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect  to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent  to which such property increases the productive or operational capacity  of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such  normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes. As to  balances in Account No. 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts,  ``Accumulated deferred income taxes--Other property,'' it will remain  the Commission's policy to deduct such balances   from the rate base of natural gas pipeline companies in rate  proceedings.
