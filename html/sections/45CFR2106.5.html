                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for written requests. Individuals desiring to amend a record that pertains to them in a system of records maintained by CFA must submit their request in writing in accordance with the procedures set forth herein unless the requirement is waived by the official having responsibility for the system of records. Records not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be amended in accordance with these provisions; however, individuals who believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention of the CFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. (1)(i) The request to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Secretary. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the

record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record as set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and CFA will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The request to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Secretary. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the

record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record as set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and CFA will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Secretary. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the

record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record as set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and CFA will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of a request to amend a record should contact the Secretary at the address cited above.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The exact portion of the record the individual seeks to have amended should be clearly indicated. If possible, the proposed alternative language should also be set forth, or, at a minimum, the facts which the individual believes are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, should be set forth with such particularity as to permit CFA not only to understand the individual's basis for the request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The request must also set forth the reasons why the individual believes his record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In order to avoid the retention by CFA of personal information merely to permit the verification of records, the burden of persuading CFA to amend a record will be upon the individual. The individual must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the official in charge of the system of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness, or incompleteness of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CFA action on the request. To the extent possible, a decision upon a request to amend a record will be made within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays). In the event that a decision cannot be made within this time frame, the individual making the request will be informed within the 10 days of the expected date for a decision. The decision upon a request for amendment will include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The decision of the Commission of Fine Arts whether to grant in full, or deny any part of the request to amend the record;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons for the determination for any part of the request which is denied;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of the denial may be lodged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The name and address of the official designated to assist, as necessary, and upon the request of, the individual making the request in preparation of the appeal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A description of the review of the appeal within CFA (see Sec. 2106.6); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A description of any other procedures which may be required of the individual in order to process an appeal.</p>
