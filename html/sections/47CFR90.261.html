Sec. 90.20(c)(3) and 90.35(b)(3) may be assigned to all eligibles for fixed use on a secondary basis to land mobile operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fixed stations located 140 km (87 mi) or more from the center of any urbanized area of 600,000 or more population are limited to a transmitter output power of 75 watts. Fixed stations less than 140 km (87 mi) from the centers of these areas are limited to a transmitter output power of 20 watts. Urbanized areas of 600,000 or more population are defined in the U.S. Census of Population 1970, Vol. 1, Table 20, pages 1-74. The centers of the urbanized areas are determined from the Appendix, page 226, of the U.S. Department of Commerce publication ``Airline Distance Between Cities in the United States.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All fixed systems are limited to one frequency pair with 5 MHz spacing and must employ directional antennas with a front-to-back ratio of 15dB, except that omnidirectional antennas

having unity gain may be employed by stations communicating with a minimum of three receiving locations encompassed in a sector of at least 160 in azimuth. Stations authorized for secondary fixed operations prior to July 13, 1992, may continue to operate under the conditions of their initial authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)-(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Secondary fixed operations pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section will not be authorized on the following frequencies or on frequencies subject to Sec. 90.267:</p><p class="depth2">Frequencies (MHz)
