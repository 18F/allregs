Sec.  90.20(c)(3) and 90.35(b)(3) may be assigned to all eligibles for fixed  use on a secondary basis to land mobile operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fixed stations located 140 km (87 mi) or more from the center of  any urbanized area of 600,000 or more population are limited to a  transmitter output power of 75 watts. Fixed stations less than 140 km  (87 mi) from the centers of these areas are limited to a transmitter  output power of 20 watts. Urbanized areas of 600,000 or more population  are defined in the U.S. Census of Population 1970, Vol. 1, Table 20,  pages 1-74.
