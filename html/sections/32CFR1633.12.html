                            <p class="depth0">No classification is permanent. The Director of Selective Service may order the reconsideration of any classification action when the facts, upon which the classification is based, change or when he finds that the registrant made a misrepresentation of any material fact related to his claim for classification. No action may be taken under the preceding sentence of this paragraph unless the registrant is notified in writing of the impending action and the reasons thereof, and is given an opportunity to respond in writing within 10 days of the mailing of the notice. If the Director orders a reconsideration of a classification in accord with this paragraph, the claim will be treated in all respects as if it were the original claim for that classification.</p>
