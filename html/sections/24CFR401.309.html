                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 1-year term with renewals. The PRA will have a term of 1 year,  to be renewed for successive terms of 1 year with the mutual agreement  of both parties. The PRA will provide for HUD to pay final compensation  to the PAE and to assign responsibility for continuing activities if the  PRA is not renewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination for cause or convenience of Federal Government--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Termination for cause. HUD may terminate a PRA at any time for cause,  with payment required by HUD as provided in   the PRA only for matters authorized by the PRA and performed by the PAE  to the date of termination. HUD will retain the right of set-off against  any payments due as well as such other rights afforded at law and in  equity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination for convenience of Federal Government. HUD may  terminate a PRA, and may remove an eligible property from a PRA, at any  time in accordance with the PRA or applicable law, regardless of whether  the PAE is in default of any of its obligations under the PRA, if such  termination is in the best interests of the Federal Government. The PRA  will provide for payment to the PAE of a specified percentage of the  base fee authorized by Sec. 401.304(a) and amounts for reimbursement of  third-party vendors to the PAE authorized by Sec. 401.304(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfer to another PAE; temporary waiver of rights. If a PRA is  terminated:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> HUD may order an immediate transfer of some or all of the PAE's  duties to another PAE designated by HUD; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HUD may temporarily waive its right of immediate termination in  order to allow an orderly transfer of duties and responsibilities under  a PRA, without waiving the right of termination after the transfer has  been completed to HUD's satisfaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability for damages. During the term of a PRA, and  notwithstanding any termination of a PRA, HUD may seek its actual,  direct, and consequential damages from any PAE for failure to comply  with its obligations under PRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cumulative remedies. The remedies under this section are  cumulative and in addition to any other remedies or rights HUD may have  under the terms of the PRA, at law, or otherwise.
