                                Sec. 27.1230  Conversion of the 2500-2690 MHz band.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">BRS and EBS licensees in the 2500-2690 MHz band on the pre-transition A-I Channels will be transitioned from the frequencies assigned to them under Sec. 27.5(i)(1) to the frequencies assigned to them under Sec. 27.5(i)(2). The transition, which will be undertaken by one or more proponent(s), will occur in the following five phases: initiating the transition process (see Sec. 27.1231), planning the transition (see Sec. 27.1232), reimbursing transition costs (see Sec. Sec. 27.1233 and 27.1237-1239), terminating existing operations in transitioned markets that do not comport with Sec. 27.5(i)(2) (see Sec. 27.1234), and filing the post-transition notification (see Sec. 27.1235). Licensees may also self-transition (see Sec. 27.1236).
