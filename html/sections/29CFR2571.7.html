                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For section 521 proceedings, this section shall apply in lieu of  Sec. 18.14 of this title:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A party may file a motion to conduct discovery with the  administrative law judge. The administrative law judge may grant a  motion for discovery only upon a showing of good cause. In order to  establish ``good cause'' for the purposes of this section, the moving  party must show that the requested discovery relates to a genuine issue  as to a fact that is material to the section 521 proceeding. The order  of the administrative law judge shall expressly limit the scope and  terms of the discovery to that for which ``good cause'' has been shown,  as provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any evidentiary privileges apply as they would apply in a civil  proceeding in federal district court. For example, legal advice provided  by an attorney to a client is generally protected from disclosure.  Mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a  party's attorney or other representative developed in anticipation of  litigation are also generally protected from disclosure. The  administrative law judge may not, however, protect from discovery or  use, relevant communications between an attorney and a plan  administrator or other plan fiduciary, or work product, that fall under  the fiduciary exception to the attorney-client or work product  privileges. The fiduciary exception to these privileges exists when an  attorney advises the plan administrator or other plan fiduciary on  matters concerning plan administration or other fiduciary activities.  Consequently, the administrative law judge may not protect such  communications from discovery or from use by the Secretary in the  proceedings. The administrative law judge also may also not protect  attorney work product prepared to assist the fiduciary in its fiduciary  capacity from discovery or from use by the Secretary in the proceedings.  The fiduciary exception does not apply, however, to the extent that  communications were made or documents were prepared exclusively to aid  the fiduciary personally or for non-fiduciary matters (e.g. settlor  acts), provided that the plan did not pay for the legal services. The  Secretary need not make a special showing, such as good cause, merely to  obtain information or documents covered by the fiduciary exception.  Other relevant exceptions to the attorney-client or work product  privileges shall also apply.</p>
