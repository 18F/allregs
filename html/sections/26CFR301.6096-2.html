Where in  accordance with prior law, such a designation was made for the account  of any candidate of any specified political party, or for a general  account for all candidates for election to the offices of President and  Vice President of the United States, such a designation shall be treated  solely as a designation to such fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife, each spouse  may designate that one dollar be paid to the fund as provided in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the joint income tax liability  of the husband and wife is two dollars or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Income tax liability. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section, the income tax liability of an individual for any taxable year  is the amount of the tax imposed by chapter 1 on such individual for  such taxable year (as shown on his return), reduced by the sum of the  credits (as shown on his return).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner and time of designation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A designation under  paragraph (a) of this section may be made with respect to any such  taxable year at the time of the filing of the return of the tax imposed  by chapter 1 for such taxable year. If such designation is made at the  time of filing the original return for such year, it shall be made by  the individual on the form furnished by the Internal Revenue Service for  such purpose in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to any taxable year ending on or after December 31,  1972   and beginning before January 1, 1973, for which no designation was made  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a designation may be made on the  form furnished by the Internal Revenue Service for such purpose, filed  within 20 and one half months after the due date for the original return  for such taxable year.
