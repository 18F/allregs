The presiding officer need not be present at any negotiations of such nature. The presiding officer shall issue an initial or recommended decision thereon recommending approval or disapproval of such offer of settlement or proposal of adjustment to the Administration for final action thereon. No agreement, offer, or proposal shall be admissible in evidence over the objection of any party in any hearing on the matter. When any settlement does not dispose of the whole proceeding, the remaining issues shall be determined in accordance with sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
