                            <p class="depth0">Each State that receives a grant under section 619 of the Act for any fiscal year must distribute all of the grant funds the State does not reserve under Sec. 300.812 to LEAs (including public charter schools that operate as LEAs) in the State that have established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Effective with funds that become available on July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to eligible LEAs that are responsible for providing education to children aged three through five years, including public charter schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any preschool children with disabilities.
