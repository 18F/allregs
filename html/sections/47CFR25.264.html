                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz  broadcasting-satellite service (BSS) must provide a series of tables or  graphs with its application, that contain the predicted transmitting  antenna off-axis gain information for each transmitting antenna in the  17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band. Using a Cartesian coordinate system  wherein the X axis is tangent to the geostationary orbital arc with the  positive direction pointing east, i.e., in the direction of travel of  the satellite; the Y axis is parallel to a line passing through the  geographic north and south poles of the Earth, with the positive  direction pointing south; and the Z axis passes through the satellite  and the center of the Earth, with the positive direction pointing toward  the Earth, the applicant must provide the predicted transmitting antenna  off-axis antenna gain information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the X-Z plane, i.e., the plane of the geostationary orbit,  over a range of 30 degrees from the positive and  negative X axes in increments of 5 degrees or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In planes rotated from the X-Z plane about the Z axis, over a  range of 60 degrees relative to the equatorial  plane, in increments of 10 degrees or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In both polarizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At a minimum of three measurement frequencies determined with  respect to the entire portion of the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band over  which the space station is designed to transmit: 5 MHz above the lower  edge of the band; at the band center frequency; and 5 MHz below the  upper edge of the band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Over a greater angular measurement range, if necessary, to  account for any planned spacecraft orientation bias or change in  operating orientation relative to the reference coordinate   system. The applicant must also explain its reasons for doing so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz BSS  must provide power flux density (pfd) calculations with its application  that are based upon the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain  information submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section,  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pfd calculations must be provided at the location of all  prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations where the applicant's pfd level  exceeds the coordination trigger of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz in the 17.3- 17.8 GHz band. In this rule, the term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station  refers to any Direct Broadcast Satellite service space station  application that was filed with the Commission (or authorization granted  by the Commission) prior to the filing of the 17/24 GHz BSS application  containing the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain information.  The term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station does not include any  applications (or authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or  are otherwise no longer valid. Prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations may  include foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve  the United States market, but do not include foreign-licensed DBS space  stations that have not filed applications with the Commission for market  access in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum  permitted longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination  and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space  stations, and must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify each prior-filed U.S. DBS space station at whose  location the coordination threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz  is exceeded; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant's transmissions  in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/ m\2\/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the calculated pfd level is in excess of the threshold level  of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz at the location of any prior-filed U.S. DBS  space station, the applicant must also provide with its application  certification that all affected DBS operators acknowledge and do not  object to the applicants higher off-axis pfd levels. No such  certification is required in cases where the DBS and 17/24 GHz BSS  assigned operating frequencies do not overlap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No later than 9 months prior to launch, each 17/24 GHz BSS space  station applicant or authorization holder must confirm the predicted  transmitting antenna off-axis gain information provided in accordance  with Sec. 25.114(d)(15)(iv) by submitting measured transmitting antenna  off-axis gain information over the angular ranges, measurement  frequencies and polarizations described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5)  of this section. The transmitting antenna off-axis gain information  should be measured under conditions as close to flight configuration as  possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No later than 9 months prior to launch, each 17/24 GHz BSS space  station applicant or authorization holder must provide pfd calculations  based upon the measured transmitting antenna off-axis gain information  that is submitted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pfd calculations must be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the location of all prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations as  defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, where the applicant's pfd  level in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceeds the coordination trigger of -117  dBW/m\2\/100 kHz; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the location of any subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space  station where the applicant's pfd level in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band  exceeds the coordination trigger of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz. In this rule,  the term subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station refers to any Direct  Broadcast Satellite service space station application that was filed  with the Commission (or authorization granted by the Commission) after  the 17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the predicted data required by  paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section, but prior to the time the  17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the measured data required in this  paragraph. Subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space stations may include  foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve the  United   States market. The term does not include any applications (or  authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or are otherwise no  longer valid, nor does it include foreign-licensed DBS space stations  that have not filed applications with the Commission for market access  in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum  permitted longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination  and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space  stations, and must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify each prior-filed U.S. DBS space station at whose  location the coordination threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz  is exceeded; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant's or licensee's  transmissions in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level  of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station  locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the pfd level calculated from the measured data submitted in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section is in excess of the  threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, then the 17/24 GHz  broadcasting-satellite operator must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coordinate its operations that are in excess of the threshold  pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz with the affected prior-filed U.S.  DBS space station operator, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjust its operating parameters so that at the location of the  prior-filed U.S. DBS space station, the pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100  kHz is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the location of any subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station  as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, where the pfd level  submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, is also in  excess of the pfd level calculated on the basis of the predicted data  submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that were on  file with the Commission at the time the DBS space station application  was filed, then the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite operator must  either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coordinate with the affected subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space  station operator all of its operations that are either in excess of the  pfd level calculated on the basis of the predicted antenna off-axis gain  data, or are in excess of the threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100  kHz, whichever is greater, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjust its operating parameters so that at the location of the  subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station, either the pfd level  calculated on the basis of the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna  gain data, or the threshold pfd level of -117 dBW/m\2\/100 kHz,  whichever is greater, is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No coordination or adjustment of operating parameters is  required in cases where the DBS and 17/24 GHz BSS operating frequencies  do not overlap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The 17/24 GHz BSS applicant or licensee must modify its license,  or amend its application, as appropriate, based upon new information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>of this section, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> or this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Absent an explicit agreement between operators to permit more  closely spaced operations, U.S. authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space stations  and U.S. authorized DBS space stations with co-frequency assignments may  not be licensed to operate at locations separated by less than 0.2  degrees in orbital longitude.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All operational 17/24 GHz BSS space stations must be maintained  in geostationary orbits that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Do not exceed 0.075[deg] of inclination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operate with an apogee less than or equal to 35,806 km above the  surface of the Earth, and with a perigee greater than or equal to 35,766  km above the surface of the Earth (i.e., an eccentricity of less than  4.7 x 10-4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> U.S. authorized DBS networks may claim protection from space  path   interference arising from the reverse-band operations of U.S. authorized  17/24 GHz BSS networks to the extent that the DBS space station operates  within the bounds of inclination and eccentricity listed below.
