                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The guidelines in this subpart specify the factors to be considered in evaluating and comparing sites on the basis of expected repository performance after closure. The postclosure guidelines are separated into a system guideline and eight technical guidelines. The system guideline establishes waste containment and isolation requirements that are based on NRC and EPA regulations. These requirements must be met by the repository system, which contains natural barriers and engineered barriers. The engineered barriers will be designed to complement the natural barriers, which provide the primary means for waste isolation.


Sec. 960.4-1  System guideline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Qualifying Condition. The geologic setting at the site shall allow for the physical separation of radioactive waste from the accessible environment after closure in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 191, subpart B, as implemented by the provisions of 10 CFR part 60. The geologic setting at the site will allow for the use of engineered barriers to ensure compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 191 and 10 CFR part 60 (see appendix I of this part).


Sec. 960.4-2  Technical guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">The technical guidelines in this subpart set forth qualifying, favorable, potentially adverse, and, in five guidelines, disqualifying conditions on the characteristics, processes, and events that may influence the performance of a repository system after closure. The favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions under each guideline are not listed in any assumed order of importance. Potentially adverse conditions will be considered if they affect waste isolation within the controlled area even though such conditions may occur outside the controlled area. The technical guidelines that follow establish conditions that shall be considered in determining compliance with the qualifying condition of the postclosure system guideline. For each technical guideline, an evaluation of qualification or disqualification shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in subpart B.

(1) Site conditions such that the pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel time along any path of likely radionuclide travel from the disturbed zone to the accessible environment would be more than 10,000 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The nature and rates of hydrologic processes operating within the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period would, if continued into the future, not affect or would favorably affect the ability of the geologic repository to isolate the waste during the next 100,000 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sites that have stratigraphic, structural, and hydrologic features such that the geohydrologic system can be readily characterized and modeled with reasonable certainty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For disposal in the saturated zone, at least one of the following pre-waste-emplacement conditions exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A host rock and immediately surrounding geohydrologic units with low hydraulic conductivities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A downward or predominantly horizontal hydraulic gradient in the host rock and in the immediately surrounding geohydrologic units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A low hydraulic gradient in and between the host rock and the immediately surrounding geohydrologic units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> High effective porosity together with low hydraulic conductivity in rock units along paths of likely radionuclide travel between the host rock and the accessible environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For disposal in the unsaturated zone, at least one of the following pre-waste-emplacement conditions exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A low and nearly constant degree of saturation in the host rock and in the immediately surrounding geohydrologic units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A water table sufficiently below the underground facility such that the fully saturated voids continuous with the water table do not encounter the host rock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A geohydrologic unit above the host rock that would divert the downward infiltration of water beyond the limits of the emplaced waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A host rock that provides for free drainage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A climatic regime in which the average annual historical precipitation is a small fraction of the average annual potential evapotranspiration.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The DOE will, in accordance with the general principles set forth in Sec. 960.1 of these regulations, revise the guidelines as necessary, to ensure consistency with the final NRC regulations on the unsaturated zone, which were published as a proposed rule on February 16, 1984, in 49 FR 5934.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Potentially adverse conditions. (1) Expected changes in geohydrologic conditions--such as changes in the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity, the effective porosity, and the ground-water flux through the host rock and the surrounding geohydrologic units--sufficient to significantly increase the transport of radionuclides to the accessible environment as compared with pre-waste-emplacement conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The presence of ground-water sources, suitable for crop irrigation or human consumption without treatment, along ground-water flow paths from the host rock to the accessible environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The presence in the geologic setting of stratigraphic or structural features--such as dikes, sills, faults, shear zones, folds, dissolution effects, or brine pockets--if their presence could significantly contribute to the difficulty of characterizing or modeling the geohydrologic system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disqualifying condition. A site shall be disqualified if the pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel time from the disturbed zone to the accessible environment is expected to be less than 1,000 years along any pathway of likely and significant radionuclide travel.

Considering the likely chemical interactions among radionuclides, the host rock, and the ground water, the characteristics of and the processes operating within the geologic setting shall permit compliance with (1) the requirements specified in Sec. 960.4-1 for radionuclide releases to the accessible environment and (2) the requirements specified in 10 CFR 60.113 for radionuclide releases from the engineered-barrier system using reasonably available technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Favorable conditions. (1) The nature and rates of the geochemical processes operating within the geologic setting during the Quaternary Period would, if continued into the future, not affect or would favorably affect the ability of the geologic repository to isolate the waste during the next 100,000 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Geochemical conditions that promote the precipitation, diffusion into the rock matrix, or sorption of radionuclides; inhibit the formation of particulates, colloids, inorganic complexes, or organic complexes that increase the mobility of radionuclides; or inhibit the transport of radionuclides by particulates, colloids, or complexes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Mineral assemblages that, when subjected to expected repository conditions, would remain unaltered or would alter to mineral assemblages with equal or increased capability to retard radionuclide transport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A combination of expected geochemical conditions and a volumetric flow rate of water in the host rock that would allow less than 0.001 percent per

year of the total radionuclide inventory in the repository at 1,000 years to be dissolved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any combination of geochemical and physical retardation processes that would decrease the predicted peak cumulative releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment by a factor of 10 as compared to those predicted on the basis of ground-water travel time without such retardation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Potentially adverse conditions.

The present and expected characteristics of the host rock and surrounding units shall be capable of accommodating the thermal, chemical, mechanical, and radiation stresses expected to be induced by repository construction, operation, and closure and by expected interactions among the waste, host rock, ground water, and engineered components. The characteristics of and the processes operating within the geologic setting shall permit compliance with (1) the requirements specified in Sec. 960.4-1 for radionuclide releases to the accessible environment and (2) the requirements set forth in 10 CFR 60.113 for radionuclide releases from the engineered-barrier system using reasonably available technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Favorable Conditions.

In assessing the likelihood of such activities, the DOE will consider the estimated effectiveness of the permanent markers and records required by 10 CFR part 60, taking into account site-specific factors, as stated in Sec. Sec. 960.4-2-8-1 and 960.4-2-8-2, that could compromise their continued effectiveness.


Sec. 960.4-2-8-1  Natural resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Qualifying condition.
