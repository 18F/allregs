If the sum of the value of the requested transfer plus the aggregate value of education awards a designated individual has previously received would exceed the aggregate value of two full-time education awards, as determined pursuant to Sec. 2526.50(b), the designated individual will be deemed to have rejected that portion of the award that would result in the excess. If a designated individual has already received the aggregate value of two full-time education awards, the individual may not receive a transferred education award, and the designated individual will be deemed to have rejected the award in full.</p>
