                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of reserve. The Owner shall establish and maintain a replacement reserve to aid in funding extraordinary maintenance and repair and replacement of capital items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deposits to reserve. The Owner shall make monthly deposits to the replacement reserve in an amount determined by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Level of reserve. The reserve must be built up to and maintained at a level determined by HUD to be sufficient to meet projected requirements. Should the reserve reach that level, the amount of the deposit to the reserve may be reduced with the approval of HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administration of reserve. Replacement reserve funds must be deposited with HUD or in a Federally-insured depository in an interest-bearing account(s) whose balances(s) are fully insured at all times. All earnings including interest on the reserve must be added to the reserve. Funds may be drawn from the reserve and used only in accordance with HUD guidelines and with the approval of, or as directed by, HUD. With HUD approval, reserves may be used to reduce the number of dwelling units, provided that the purpose for the reduction is the retrofitting of obsolete or unmarketable units.
