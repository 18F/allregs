                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Agency may approve mergers or consolidations  (herein referred to as ``mergers'') when the resulting organization will  be eligible for   an Agency guaranteed loan and assumes all the liabilities and acquires  all the assets of the merged borrower. Mergers may be approved when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The merger is in the best interest of the Government and the  merging borrower;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting borrower can meet all required conditions as  contained in specific loan note agreements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All property can be legally transferred to the resulting  borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distinguishing mergers from transfers and assumptions. Mergers  occur when one entity combines with another entity in such a way that  the first entity ceases to exist as a separate entity while the other  continues. In a consolidation, two or more entities combine to form a  new, consolidated entity with the original entity ceasing to exist. Such  transactions must be distinguished from transfers and assumptions in  which a transferor will not necessarily go out of existence, and the  transferee will not always take all the transferor's assets nor assume  all the transferor's liabilities.</p>
