                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements and acceptance criteria. (1) The maximum calculated design stress at any point in the cargo tank wall may not exceed the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used at design conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The maximum calculated design stress at any point in the cargo tank wall may not exceed the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used at design conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each cargo tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The maximum design stress at any point in the cargo tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in place of the procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable. TTMA RP 96-01, Structural Integrity of DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 Cylindrical Cargo Tanks, may be used as guidance in performing the calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Corrosion allowance material may not be included to satisfy any of the design calculation requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ASME Code design and construction. The static design and construction of each cargo tank must be in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. The cargo tank design must include calculation of stresses generated by the MAWP, the weight of the lading, the weight of structures

supported by the cargo tank wall and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in the calculation of thermal stresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stress concentrations in tension, bending and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Longitudinal compressive buckling stress for ASME certified vessels must be calculated using paragraph UG-23(b) in Section VIII of the ASME Code. For cargo tanks not required to be certified in accordance with the ASME Code, compressive buckling stress may be calculated using alternative analysis methods which are accurate and verifiable. When alternative methods are used, calculations must include both the static loads described in this paragraph and the dynamic loads described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cargo tank designers and manufacturers must consider all of the conditions specified in Sec. 173.33(c) of this subchapter when matching a cargo tank's performance characteristic to the characteristic of each lading transported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Shell design. Shell stresses resulting from static or dynamic loadings, or combinations thereof, are not uniform throughout the cargo tank motor vehicle. The vertical, longitudinal, and lateral normal operating loadings can occur simultaneously and must be combined. The vertical, longitudinal and lateral extreme dynamic loadings occur separately and need not be combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal operating loadings.

The following procedure addresses stress in the cargo tank shell resulting from extreme dynamic loadings. The effective stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula:
