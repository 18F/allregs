                                Sec. 20.6161-2  Extension of time for paying deficiency in tax.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In any case in which the district director finds that payment,  on the date prescribed therefor, of any part of a deficiency would  impose undue hardship upon the estate, he may extend the time for  payment for a period or periods not to exceed one year for any one  period and for all periods not to exceed four years from the date  prescribed for payment thereof. However, see Sec. 20.6161-1 for  extensions of time for payment of the part of a deficiency which is  prorated to installments under the provisions of section 6166.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The extension will not be granted upon a general statement of  hardship. The term ``undue hardship'' means more than an inconvenience  to the estate. It must appear that a substantial financial loss, for  example, due to the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result  to the estate from making payment of the deficiency at the date  prescribed therefor. If a market exists, a sale of property at the  current market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an  undue hardship. No extension will be granted if the deficiency is due to  negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations or to fraud  with intent to evade the tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An application for such an extension must be in writing and must  contain, or be supported by, information in a written statement  declaring that it is made under penalties of perjury showing the undue  hardship that would result to the estate if the extension were refused.  The application, with the supporting information, must be filed with the  district director. When received, it will be examined, and, if possible,  within thirty days will be denied, granted, or tentatively granted  subject to certain conditions of which the executor will be notified.  The district director will not consider an application for such an  extension unless it is applied for on or before the date prescribed for  payment of the deficiency, as shown by the notice and demand from the  district director. If the executor desires to obtain an additional  extension, it must be applied for on or before the date of the  expiration of the previous extension. The granting of the extension of  time for paying the deficiency is discretionary with the district  director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amount of the deficiency for which an extension is granted,  with the additions thereto, shall be paid on or before the expiration of  the period of extension without the necessity of notice and demand from  the district director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The granting of an extension of time for paying the deficiency  will not operate to prevent the running of interest. See section 6601.  An extension of time to pay the deficiency may extend the period within  which State and foreign death taxes allowed as a credit under sections  2011 and 2014 are required to be paid and the credit therefor claimed.  See paragraph (c) of Sec. 20.2011-1 and Sec. 20.2014-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For provisions requiring the furnishing of security for the  payment of the deficiency for which an extension is granted, see Sec.  20.6165-1.
