                            <p class="depth0">In addition to provisions required for a valid and legally binding  contract, any recipient of Agency funds shall include the following  contract provisions in all contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedies. Contracts other than small purchases shall contain  provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative,  contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or  breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as  may be appropriate. A realistic liquidated damage provision should be  included in all contracts for construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination. All contracts exceeding $10,000, shall contain  suitable provisions for termination by the owner including the manner by  which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,  such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be  terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be  terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the  contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Surety. In all contracts for construction or facility  improvements exceeding $100,000, the owner shall require bonds or cash  deposit in escrow assuring performance and payment each in the amount of  100 percent of the contract cost. The surety will be in the form of  performance bonds and payment bonds. For contracts of lesser amounts,  the owner may require surety. When a surety is not provided, contractors  will furnish evidence of payment in full for all materials, labor, and  any other items procured under the contract. Form RD 1924-10, ``Release  by Claimants,'' and Form RD 1924-9, ``Certificate of Contractor's  Release,'' may be used for this purpose. Companies providing performance  bonds and payment bonds must hold a certificate of authority as an  acceptable surety on Federal bonds as listed in Treasury Circular 570 as  amended and the surety must be listed as having a license to do business  in the State where the facility is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equal employment opportunity. All contracts awarded in excess of  $10,000 by owners shall contain a provision requiring compliance with  Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1966 Comp., p.339), entitled, ``Equal  Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 11375 (3 CFR,  1968 Comp., p. 321), and as supplemented by Department of Labor  regulations 41 CFR chapter 60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Anti-kickback. All contracts for construction shall include a  provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18  U.S.C. 874). This Act provides that each contractor shall be prohibited  from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction,  completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the  compensation to which they are otherwise entitled. The owner shall  report suspected or reported violations to the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records. All negotiated contracts (except those of $10,000 or  less) awarded by owners shall include a provision to the effect that the  owner, the Agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any  of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any  books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are  directly pertinent to a specific Federal loan or grant program for the  purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcriptions.  Owners shall require contractors to maintain all required records for 3  years after making final payment and all other pending matters are  closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> State energy conservation plan. Contracts shall incorporate  mandatory   standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained  in the State energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the  Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Change orders. The construction contract shall require that all  contract change orders be concurred in by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Agency concurrence. All contracts must contain a provision that  they shall not be effective unless and until the State program official  or designee concurs in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Retainage. All construction contracts shall contain adequate  provisions for retainage. No payments will be made that would deplete  the retainage nor place in escrow any funds that are required for  retainage nor invest the retainage for the benefit of the contractor.  The retainage shall not be less than an amount equal to 5 percent of an  approved partial payment estimate until the project is substantially  complete and accepted by the owner, consulting engineer and Agency. The  contract must provide that additional amounts may be retained if the job  is not proceeding satisfactorily.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Other compliance requirements. Contracts in excess of $100,000  shall contain a provision which requires compliance with all applicable  standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean  Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33  U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738 (3 CFR, 1974 Comp., p.209), and  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations 40 CFR part 15, which  prohibit the use under non-exempt Federal contracts, grants or loans of  facilities included on the EPA List of Violating Facilities. The  provision shall require reporting of violations to the Agency and to the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Assistant Administrator for  Enforcement. Solicitations and contract provisions shall include the  requirements of 4 CFR 15.4(c) as set forth in RUS Bulletin 1780-14.</p>
