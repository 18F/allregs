The appropriate JS official shall offer to take the complaint in writing if it is JS related, or if non-JS related, it alleges violations of employment related laws enforced by ESA or OSHA and is filed by or on behalf of an MSFW. The official shall require that the complainant put the complaint on the JS Complaint/Referral Form prescribed or approved by the ETA. The JS Complaint/Referral Form shall be used for all complaints taken by a State agency, including complaints about unlawful discrimination, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The State agency official shall offer to assist the complainant in filling out the form and shall do so if the complainant desires such assistance. If the complainant also represents several other complainants, all such complainants shall be named on the JS Complaint/Referral Form. The complainant shall sign the completed form. The identity of the complainant(s) and any persons who furnish information relating to, or assisting in, an investigation of a complaint shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable law and a fair determination of the complaint.

The JS official shall send a confirming letter to this effect to the complainant and shall give the document to the appropriate JS official. If the complainant has not provided sufficient information to investigate the matter expeditiously, the JS official shall request additional information from the complainant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the appropriate JS official determines that the complaint is not JS-related, the official shall follow the procedures set forth in Sec. 658.414.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the appropriate JS official determines that the complaint is JS-related, the official shall ensure that the complaint is handled in accordance with this subpart E.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> During the initial discussion with the complainant, the JS official receiving the complaint shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make every effort to obtain all the information he/she perceives to be necessary to investigate the complaint;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request that the complainant indicate all of the addresses through which he or she might be contacted during the investigation of the complaint;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request that the complainant contact the JS before leaving the area if possible, and explain the need to maintain contact during the complaint investigation.
