Articles subject to this exemption shall be entered under the informal entry procedures (see subpart C, part 143, and Sec. Sec. 145.32, 148.12, 148.51, and 148.64, of this chapter). An article is ``sent'' for purposes of this section if it is conveyed in any manner other than on the person or in the accompanied or unaccompanied baggage of the donor or donee.
