A Bank may issue either one or both classes of its capital stock (including subclasses), as authorized by Sec. 931.1, and shall not issue any other class of capital stock. A Bank shall issue its stock only to its members and only in book-entry form, and the Bank shall act as its own transfer agent. All capital stock shall be issued in accordance with the Bank's capital plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial issuance. In connection with the initial issuance of its Class A and/or Class B stock (or any subclass of either), a Bank may issue such stock in exchange for its existing stock, through a conversion of its existing stock, or through any other fair and equitable transaction or method of distribution. As part of its initial stock issuance transaction, a Bank may distribute any portion of its then-existing unrestricted retained earnings as shares of Class B stock.</p>
