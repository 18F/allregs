                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public water systems may use point-of-entry devices to comply  with maximum contaminant levels only if they meet the requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the responsibility of the public water system to operate  and maintain the point-of-entry treatment system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The public water system must develop and obtain State approval  for a monitoring plan before point-of-entry devices are installed for  compliance. Under the plan approved by the State, point-of-entry devices  must provide health protection equivalent to central water treatment.  ``Equivalent'' means that the water would meet all national primary  drinking water regulations and would be of acceptable quality similar to  water distributed by a well-operated central treatment plant. In  addition to the VOCs, monitoring must include physical measurements and  observations such as total flow treated and mechanical condition of the  treatment equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective technology must be properly applied under a plan  approved by the State and the microbiological safety of the water must  be maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State must require adequate certification of performance,  field testing, and, if not included in the certification process, a  rigorous engineering design review of the point-of-entry devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The design and application of the point-of-entry devices must  consider the tendency for increase in heterotrophic bacteria  concentrations in water treated with activated carbon. It may be  necessary to use frequent backwashing, post-contactor disinfection, and  Heterotrophic Plate Count monitoring to ensure that the microbiological  safety of the water is not compromised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All consumers shall be protected. Every building connected to  the system must have a point-of-entry device installed, maintained, and  adequately monitored. The State must be assured that every building is  subject to treatment and monitoring, and that the rights and  responsibilities of the public water system customer convey with title  upon sale of property.
