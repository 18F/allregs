Transfers of any substances listed in Schedule I or II shall  require the use of order forms in accordance with part 1305 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the date of transfer of the controlled substances, all  records required to be kept by the registrant-transferor with reference  to the controlled substances being transferred, under part 1304 of this  chapter, shall be transferred to the registrant-transferee.  Responsibility for the accuracy of records prior to the date of transfer  remains with the transferor, but responsibility for custody and  maintenance shall be upon the transferee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of registrants required to make reports pursuant to  part 1304 of this chapter, a report marked ``Final'' will be prepared  and submitted by the registrant-transferor showing the disposition of  all the controlled substances for which a report is required; no  additional report will be required from him, if no further transactions  involving controlled substances are consummated by him. The initial  report of the registrant-transferee shall account for transactions  beginning with the day next succeeding the date of discontinuance or  transfer of business by the transferor-registrant and the substances  transferred to him shall be reported as receipts in his/her initial  report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any registrant that has been authorized as a collector and  desires to discontinue its collection of controlled substances from  ultimate users shall notify the Administration of its intent by  submitting a written notification to the Registration Unit, Drug  Enforcement Administration.
