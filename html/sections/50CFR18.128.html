                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Mitigation. Holders of a Letter of Authorization must use methods and conduct activities in a manner that minimizes to the greatest extent practicable adverse impacts on walruses and polar bears, their habitat, and on the availability of these marine mammals for subsistence uses. Dynamic management approaches, such as temporal or spatial limitations in response to the presence of marine mammals in a particular place or time or the occurrence of marine mammals engaged in a particularly sensitive activity (such as feeding), must be used to avoid or minimize interactions with polar bears, walruses, and subsistence users of these resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All applicants. (i) We require holders of Letters of Authorization to cooperate with us and other designated Federal, State, and local agencies to monitor the impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities on polar bears and Pacific walruses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate a qualified individual or individuals to observe, record, and report on the effects of their activities on polar bears and Pacific walruses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must have an approved polar bear and/or walrus interaction plan on file with the Service and onsite, and polar bear awareness training will also be required of certain personnel. Interaction plans must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The type of activity and, where and when the activity will occur, i.e., a plan of operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A food and waste management plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Personnel training materials and procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Site at-risk locations and situations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Walrus and bear observation and reporting procedures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Bear and walrus avoidance and encounter procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All applicants for a Letter of Authorization must contact affected subsistence communities to discuss potential conflicts caused by location, timing, and methods of proposed operations and submit to us a record of communication that documents these discussions. If appropriate, the applicant for a Letter of Authorization must also submit to us a POC that ensures that activities will not interfere with subsistence hunting and that adverse effects on the availability of polar bear or Pacific walruses are minimized (see Sec.  18.124(c)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If deemed appropriate by the Service, holders of a Letter of Authorization will be required to hire and train polar bear monitors to alert crew of the presence of polar bears and initiate adaptive mitigation responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Onshore activities. (i) Efforts to minimize disturbance around known polar bear dens.--Holders of a Letter of Authorization must take efforts to limit disturbance around known polar bear dens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Efforts to locate polar bear dens.--Holders of a Letter of Authorization seeking to carry out onshore exploration activities in known or suspected polar bear denning habitat during the denning season (November-April) must make efforts to locate occupied polar bear dens within and near proposed

areas of operation, utilizing appropriate tools, such as, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imagery and/or polar bear scent-trained dogs. All observed or suspected polar bear dens must be reported to the Service prior to the initiation of activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusion zone around known polar bear dens.--Operators must observe a 1.6-km (1-mi) operational exclusion zone around all known polar bear dens during the denning season (November-April, or until the female and cubs leave the areas). Should previously unknown occupied dens be discovered within 1.6 km (1 mi) of activities, work must cease and the Service contacted for guidance. The Service will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate action. Potential actions may range from cessation or modification of work to conducting additional monitoring, and the holder of the authorization must comply with any additional measures specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Use of a den habitat map developed by the USGS.--A map of potential coastal polar bear denning habitat can be found at: http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/polar--bears/pubs.html. This measure ensures that the location of potential polar bear dens is considered when conducting activities in the coastal areas of the Beaufort Sea.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Timing restrictions.--Operators must restrict the timing of their activity to limit disturbance around dens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operating conditions for operational and support vessels. (i) Operational and support vessels must be staffed with dedicated marine mammal observers to alert crew of the presence of walruses and polar bears and initiate adaptive mitigation responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At all times, vessels must maintain the maximum distance possible from concentrations of walruses or polar bears. Under no circumstances, other than an emergency, should any vessel approach within an 805-m (0.5-mi) radius of walruses or polar bears observed on land or ice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vessel operators must take every precaution to avoid harassment of concentrations of feeding walruses when a vessel is operating near these animals. Vessels should reduce speed and maintain a minimum 805-m (0.5-mi) operational exclusion zone around feeding walrus groups. Vessels may not be operated in such a way as to separate members of a group of walruses from other members of the group. When weather conditions require, such as when visibility drops, vessels should adjust speed accordingly to avoid the likelihood of injury to walruses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All vessels shall avoid areas of active or anticipated walrus or polar bear hunting activity as determined through community consultations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> We may require the use of trained marine mammal monitors on the site of the activity or on board drill ships, drill rigs, aircraft, icebreakers, or other support vessels or vehicles to monitor the impacts of Industry's activity on polar bear and Pacific walruses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operating conditions for aircraft. (i) Operators of support aircraft should, at all times, conduct their activities at the maximum distance possible from concentrations of walruses or polar bears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under no circumstances, other than an emergency, should aircraft operate at an altitude lower than 457 m (1,500 ft) within 805 m (0.5 mi) of walruses or polar bears observed on ice or land. Helicopters may not hover or circle above such areas or within 805 m (0.5 mile) of such areas. When weather conditions do not allow a 457-m (1,500-ft) flying altitude, such as during severe storms or when cloud cover is low, aircraft may be operated below the 457-m (1,500-ft) altitude stipulated above. However, when aircraft are operated at altitudes below 457 m (1,500 ft) because of weather conditions, the operator must avoid areas of known walrus and polar bear concentrations and should take precautions to avoid flying directly over or within 805 m (0.5 mile) of these areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plan all aircraft routes to minimize any potential conflict with active or anticipated walrus or polar bear hunting activity as determined through community consultations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional mitigation measures for offshore seismic surveys. Any offshore exploration activity expected to include the production of pulsed underwater sounds with sound source levels

=160 dB re 1 [micro]Pa will be required to establish and monitor acoustic exclusion and disturbance zones and implement adaptive mitigation measures as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monitor zones. Establish and monitor with trained marine mammal observers an acoustically verified exclusion zone for walruses surrounding seismic airgun arrays where the received level would be =180 dB re 1 [micro]Pa; an acoustically verified exclusion zone for polar bear surrounding seismic airgun arrays where the received level would be =190 dB re 1 [micro]Pa; and an acoustically verified walrus disturbance zone ahead of and perpendicular to the seismic vessel track where the received level would be =160 dB re 1 [micro]Pa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ramp-up procedures. For all seismic surveys, including airgun testing, use the following ramp-up procedures to allow marine mammals to depart the exclusion zone before seismic surveying begins:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Visually monitor the exclusion zone and adjacent waters for the absence of polar bears and walruses for at least 30 minutes before initiating ramp-up procedures. If no polar bears or walruses are detected, you may initiate ramp-up procedures. Do not initiate ramp-up procedures at night or when you cannot visually monitor the exclusion zone for marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Initiate ramp-up procedures by firing a single airgun. The preferred airgun to begin with should be the smallest airgun, in terms of energy output (dB) and volume (in\3\).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Continue ramp-up by gradually activating additional airguns over a period of at least 20 minutes, but no longer than 40 minutes, until the desired operating level of the airgun array is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Power down/Shut down. Immediately power down or shut down the seismic airgun array and/or other acoustic sources whenever any walruses are sighted approaching close to or within the area delineated by the 180-dB re 1 [micro]Pa walrus exclusion zone, or polar bears are sighted approaching close to or within the area delineated by the 190-dB re 1 [micro]Pa polar bear exclusion zone. If the power-down operation cannot reduce the received sound pressure level to 180-dB re 1 [micro]Pa (walrus) or 190-dB re 1 [micro]Pa (polar bears), the operator must immediately shut down the seismic airgun array and/or other acoustic sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Emergency shut down. If observations are made or credible reports are received that one or more walruses and/or polar bears are within the area of the seismic survey and are in an injured or mortal state, or are indicating acute distress due to seismic noise, the seismic airgun array will be immediately shut down and the Service contacted. The airgun array will not be restarted until review and approval has been given by the Service. The ramp-up procedures provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section must be followed when restarting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Adaptive response for walrus aggregations. Whenever an aggregation of 12 or more walruses are detected within an acoustically verified 160-dB re 1 [micro]Pa disturbance zone ahead of or perpendicular to the seismic vessel track, the holder of this Authorization must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Immediately power down or shutdown the seismic airgun array and/or other acoustic sources to ensure sound pressure levels at the shortest distance to the aggregation do not exceed 160-dB re 1 [micro]Pa; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Not proceed with powering up the seismic airgun array until it can be established that there are no walrus aggregations within the 160-dB zone based upon ship course, direction, and distance from last sighting. If shutdown was required, the ramp-up procedures provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section must be followed when restarting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Mitigation measures for the subsistence use of walruses and polar bears. Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct their activities in a manner that, to the greatest extent practicable, minimizes adverse impacts on the availability of Pacific walruses and polar bears for subsistence uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Community Consultation. Prior to receipt of a Letter of Authorization, applicants must consult with potentially affected communities and appropriate subsistence user organizations to discuss potential conflicts with subsistence walrus and polar bear hunting caused by the location, timing, and

methods of proposed operations and support activities (see Sec.  18.124(c)(4) for details). If community concerns suggest that the proposed activities may have an adverse impact on the subsistence uses of these species, the applicant must address conflict avoidance issues through a POC as described below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan of Cooperation (POC). Where prescribed, holders of Letters of Authorization will be required to develop and implement a Service-approved POC. The POC must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the procedures by which the holder of the Letter of Authorization will work and consult with potentially affected subsistence hunters; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of specific measures that have been or will be taken to avoid or minimize interference with subsistence hunting of walruses and polar bears and to ensure continued availability of the species for subsistence use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Service will review the POC to ensure that any potential adverse effects on the availability of the animals are minimized. The Service will reject POCs if they do not provide adequate safeguards to ensure the least practicable adverse impact on the availability of walruses and polar bears for subsistence use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring. Depending on the location, timing, and nature of proposed activities, holders of Letters of Authorization will be required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintain trained, Service-approved, onsite observers to carry out monitoring programs for polar bears and walruses necessary for initiating adaptive mitigation responses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For offshore activities, Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) will be required on board all operational and support vessels to alert crew of the presence of walruses and polar bears and initiate adaptive mitigation responses identified in paragraph (a) of this section, and to carry out specified monitoring activities identified in the marine mammal monitoring and mitigation plan (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) necessary to evaluate the impact of authorized activities on walruses, polar bears, and the subsistence use of these subsistence resources. The MMOs must have completed a marine mammal observer training course approved by the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Polar bear monitors--Polar bear monitors will be required under the monitoring plan if polar bears are known to frequent the area or known polar bear dens are present in the area. Monitors will act as an early detection system in regard to proximate bear activity to Industry facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Develop and implement a site-specific, Service-approved, marine mammal monitoring and mitigation plan to monitor and evaluate the effects of authorized activities on polar bears, walruses, and the subsistence use of these resources. The marine mammal monitoring and mitigation plan must enumerate the number of walruses and polar bears encountered during specified activities, estimate the number of incidental takes that occurred during specified exploration activities, and evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cooperate with the Service and other designated Federal, State, and local agencies to monitor the impacts of oil and gas activities in the Beaufort Sea on walruses or polar bears. Where insufficient information exists to evaluate the potential effects of proposed activities on walruses, polar bears, and the subsistence use of these resources, holders of Letters of Authorization may be required to participate in joint monitoring and/or research efforts to address these information needs and insure the least practicable impact to these resources. Information needs in the Beaufort Sea include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Distribution, abundance, and habitat use patterns of polar bears, and to a lesser extent walruses in offshore environments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cumulative effects of multiple simultaneous operations on polar bears and to a lesser extent walruses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements. Holders of Letters of Authorization must report the results of specified monitoring activities to the Service's Alaska Regional director (see 50 CFR 2.2 for address).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For exploratory and development activities, holders of a Letter of Authorization must submit a report to

our Alaska Regional Director (Attn: Marine Mammals Management Office) within 90 days after completion of activities. For production activities, holders of a Letter of Authorization must submit a report to our Alaska Regional Director (Attn: Marine Mammals Management Office) by January 15 for the preceding year's activities. Reports must include, at a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dates and times of activity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dates and locations of polar bear or Pacific walrus activity as related to the monitoring activity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Results of the monitoring activities required under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, including an estimated level of take.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monitoring requirements include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For all activities, all sightings of polar bears must be recorded.
