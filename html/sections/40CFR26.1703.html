EPA  must not rely on data from research subject to this subpart unless EPA  determines that the data are relevant to a scientific or policy question  important for EPA decisionmaking, that the data were derived in a manner  that makes them scientifically valid and reliable, and that it is  appropriate to use the data for the purpose proposed by EPA. In making  such determinations, EPA must consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the research was designed and conducted in accordance  with appropriate scientific standards and practices prevailing at the  time the research was conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the research subjects are representative of  the populations for the endpoint or endpoints in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The statistical power of the data to support the scientific  conclusion EPA intends to draw from the data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In a study that reports only a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL)  or a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), whether a dose level in  the study gave rise to a biological effect, thereby demonstrating that  the study had adequate sensitivity to detect an effect of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibition of reliance on research subject to this subpart  involving intentional exposure of human subjects who are pregnant women  (and therefore their fetuses), nursing women, or children. Except as  provided in Sec. 26.1706, EPA must not rely on data from any research  subject to this subpart involving intentional exposure of any human  subject who is a pregnant woman (and therefore her fetus), a nursing  woman, or a child.
