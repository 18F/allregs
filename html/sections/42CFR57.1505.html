                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Any application for loan guarantee or interest  subsidies, or for a combination of both, may be approved by the  Secretary, after consultation with the Council, only if he makes each of  the applicable determinations set forth in section 721(c) of the Act. In  addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any such approval shall be subject to compliance by the  applicant with the applicable provisions set forth in Sec. Sec.  57.106,  57.107, 57.108, and 57.110: Provided however, That for purposes of the  title assurance in Sec.  57.107(a) the period shall be not less than 20  years or the term of the guaranteed loan, whichever is longer or in the  case of interim facilities, the term of the guaranteed loan, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any such application may be approved by the Secretary only if he  determines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the applicant will have sufficient financial resources to  enable him to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the applicant has the necessary legal authority to  finance, construct, and maintain the proposed project, to apply for and  receive the loan, and to pledge or mortgage any assets or revenues to be  given as security for such loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the loan will be made only with respect to the initial  permanent financing of the project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the loan will be secured by a lien against the facilities  to be constructed or against other security satisfactory to the  Secretary specified in Sec.  57.2210;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That the rate of interest on the loan does not exceed such  percent per annum as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking  into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private  market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Such additional determinations as the Secretary finds necessary  with respect to particular applications in order to protect the  financial interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan guarantees. In addition to the requirements of paragraph  (a) of this section, any application for a loan guarantee may be  approved by the Secretary only if he determines that the loan with  respect to which such guarantee is sought would not be available to the  applicant on reasonable terms and conditions without such guarantee. To  assist the Secretary in making such determination, each applicant for a  loan guarantee shall submit statements from at least three non-Federal  institutions normally engaged in making long-term loans for  construction, describing whether, and the terms and conditions under  which, each institution would make a loan to the applicant for the  project described in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest subsidies. In addition to the requirements of paragraph  (a) of this section, any application for interest subsidies may be  approved by the Secretary only if he determines that without such  interest subsidy payments the applicant would not, over a substantial  portion of the loan term, be able to repay the principal and interest of  the loan without jeopardizing the quality of the educational program.</p>
