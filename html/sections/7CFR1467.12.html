                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The development of the WRPO will be made through the local NRCS  representative, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, with  consideration of site-specific technical input from FWS and the  Conservation District.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land  shall be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to  accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO will be developed to  ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife  benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the  WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the on-site  alternations and the off-site watershed conditions that adversely impact  the hydrology and associated wildlife and wetland functions and values.  NRCS will review, revise, and supplement the WRPO as needed throughout  the duration of the enrollment to ensure that program goals are fully  and effectively achieved.
