Employees are also  prohibited from striking against the Federal Government. With these  restrictions, an employee has the right to form, join, or assist lawful  employee organizations. Similarly, an employee has   also the right to refrain from such activity. In either case, the  employee may exercise his or her right freely and without fear of  penalty or reprisal and shall be protected in the exercise of such  rights.</p>
