                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The CPSC may suspend its acceptance of a third party conformity  assessment body's accreditation for any portion of its scope when the  third party conformity assessment body fails to cooperate with an  investigation under section 14 of the CPSA. A third party conformity  assessment body ``fails to cooperate'' when it does not respond to CPSC  inquiries or requests, or it responds in a manner that is unresponsive,  evasive, deceptive, or substantially incomplete, or when it fails to  cooperate with an investigatory inspection under Sec. 1112.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, or until the  CPSC withdraws its acceptance of the third party conformity assessment  body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the CPSC determines that the third party conformity  assessment body is cooperating sufficiently with the CPSC's  investigation, the CPSC will lift the suspension. The suspension will  lift as of the date of the CPSC's written notification to the third  party conformity assessment body that the CPSC is lifting the  suspension. The written notification may be by electronic mail.</p>
