Emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set. For Tier 4 engines, there are two averaging sets--one for engines at or below 560 kW and another for engines above 560 kW.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Emission credits from earlier tiers of standards. (1) For purposes of ABT under this subpart, you may not use emission credits generated from engines subject to emission standards under 40 CFR part 89, except as specified in Sec.  1039.102(d)(1) or the following table:

You may use NOX emission credits without adjustment to show compliance with NOX+NMHC standards. You may use NOX+NMHC emission credits to show compliance with NOX standards, but you must adjust the

NOX+NMHC emission credits downward by twenty percent when you use them, as shown in the following equation:
NOX emission credits = (0.8) x (NOX+NMHC emission credits).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other restrictions. Other sections of this part specify additional restrictions for using emission credits under certain special provisions.
