In making this determination, the Secretary will take into consideration the applicant's net financial assets, his or her potential earning capacity, and the relationship of the income available to the applicant to the low-income levels published annually by the Secretary in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant will be considered as not having resumed his or her nursing studies within 2 years following the date the individual ceased to be a student upon certification so stating from the applicant; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An applicant will be considered as not reasonably expected to resume his or her nursing studies within 2 years following the date upon which he or she terminated these studies, based upon consideration of the reasons for the applicant's failure to complete these studies, taking into account such factors as academic, medical, or financial difficulties. The Secretary will only repay education loans made after November 17, 1971.
