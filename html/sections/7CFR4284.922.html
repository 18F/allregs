for at least 2 years at time of application submission, may submit a business or marketing plan for the value-added project in lieu of a feasibility study. These applications must still document for increased customer base and increased revenues returning to the applicant producers as a result of the project, and meet all other eligibility requirements. Further, the waiver of the independent feasibility study does not change the proposal evaluation or scoring elements that pertain to issues that might be supported by an independent feasibility study, so applicants are encouraged to well-document their project plans and expectations for success in their proposals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All four applicant types that submit a Simplified Application for working capital grant funds of less than $50,000 are not required to provide an independent feasibility study or business plan for the project/venture but must provide adequate documentation to demonstrate the expected increases in customer base and revenues resulting from the project that will benefit the producer applicants supplying the majority of the agricultural commodity for the project.
