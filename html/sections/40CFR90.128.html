Include all  information necessary to ensure that an engine will be installed in its  certified configuration. In particular, describe the steps needed to  control evaporative emissions, as described in Sec. 90.127. This may  include information related to the delayed requirements for small-volume  equipment manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You do not need installation instructions for engines you  install in your own equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provide instructions in writing or in an equivalent format. For  example, you may post instructions on a publicly available Web site for  downloading or printing. If you do not provide the instructions in  writing, explain in your application for certification how you will  ensure that each   installer is informed of the installation requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equipment manufacturers failing to follow the engine  manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions will be  considered in violation of Sec. 90.1003.
