                            <p class="depth0">Clostridium Perfringens Type D Antitoxin is a specific antibody  product containing antibodies directed against the toxin of Clostridium  perfringens Type D. Each serial shall be tested as provided in this  section. Any serial found unsatisfactory by a prescribed test shall not  be released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each serial shall meet the applicable general requirements  provided in Sec. 113.450.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Potency test. Bulk or final container samples of completed  product from each serial shall be tested using the toxin-neutralization  test for Epsilon Antitoxin provided in this section. Dried products  shall be rehydrated according to label directions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When used in this test, the following words and terms shall  mean:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> International antitoxin unit. (I.U.) That quantity of Epsilon  Antitoxin which reacts with L0 and L+ doses of  Standard Toxin according to their definitions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> L0dose. The largest quantity of toxin which can be  mixed with one-tenth unit of Standard Antitoxin and not cause sickness  or death in injected mice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> L+dose. The smallest quantity of toxin which can be  mixed with one-tenth unit of Standard Antitoxin and cause death in at  least 80 percent of injected mice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Standard antitoxin. The Epsilon Antitoxin preparation which has  been standardized as to antitoxin unitage on the basis of the  International Clostridium perfringens Epsilon Antitoxin   Standard and which is either supplied by or acceptable to Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service. The antitoxin unit value shall be  stated on the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Standard toxin. The Epsilon toxin preparation which is supplied  by or is acceptable to Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Diluent. The solution used to make proper dilutions prescribed  in this test. Such solution shall be made by dissolving 1 gram of  peptone and 0.25 gram of sodium chloride in each 100 ml of distilled  water; adjusting the pH to 7.2; autoclaving at 250 [deg]F. for 25  minutes; and storing at 4 [deg]C. until used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The antitoxin content of the test sample shall be determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make a dilution of Standard Antitoxin to contain 1 International  Unit of antitoxin per ml.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make one dilution of Standard Toxin to contain 10 L0  doses per ml and make a second dilution of Standard Toxin to contain 10  L+ doses per ml.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dilute 1 ml of the test sample with 33 ml of diluent and  combine 1 ml of this dilution with 1 ml of the Standard Toxin diluted to  contain 10 L0 doses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Combine 1 International Unit of Standard Antitoxin with 10  L0 doses of Standard Toxin and combine 1 International Unit  of Standard Antitoxin with 10 L+ doses of Standard Toxin.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Neutralize all toxin-antitoxin mixtures at room temperature for  1 hour, and hold in ice water until injections of mice can be made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Five Swiss white mice, each weighing 16-20 grams, shall be used  for each toxin-antitoxin mixture. A dose of 0.2 ml shall be injected  intravenously into each mouse. Conclude the test 24 hours post-injection  and record all deaths.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test Interpretation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any mice inoculated with the mixture  of 1 International Unit of Standard Antitoxin and 10 L0 doses  of Standard Toxin die, the results of the test are a No Test and shall  be repeated: Provided, That, if the test is not repeated, the serial  shall be declared unsatisfactory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If less than 80 percent of the mice inoculated with mixture of  1 International Unit of Standard Antitoxin and 10 L+ doses of  Standard Toxin die, the results of the test are a No Test and shall be  repeated: Provided, That, if the test is not repeated, the serial shall  be declared unsatisfactory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If any mice inoculated with the mixture of Clostridium  Perfringens Type D Antitoxin diluted 1:34 and 10 L0 doses of  Standard Toxin die, the antitoxin is considered to contain less than 34  International Units per ml and the serial is unsatisfactory.
