                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Does this rule apply to me? (1) This rule (Secs. 1910.123 through 1910.126) applies when you use a dip tank containing a liquid other than water. It applies when you use the liquid in the tank or its vapor to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clean an object;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coat an object;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alter the surface of an object; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Change the character of an object.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This rule also applies to the draining or drying of an object you have dipped or coated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What operations are covered? Examples of covered operations are paint dipping, electroplating, pickling, quenching, tanning, degreasing, stripping, cleaning, roll coating, flow coating, and curtain coating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What operations are not covered? You are not covered by this rule if your dip-tank operation only uses a molten material (a molten metal, alloy, or salt, for example).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How are terms used in Secs. 1910.123 through 1910.126 defined?</p><p class="depth0">Adjacent area means any area within 20 feet (6.1 m) of a vapor area that is not separated from the vapor area by tight partitions.</p><p class="depth0">Approved means that the equipment so designated is listed or approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, as defined by Sec. 1910.7.</p><p class="depth0">Autoignition temperature means the minimum temperature required to cause self-sustained combustion, independent of any other source of heat.</p><p class="depth0">Dip tank means a container holding a liquid other than water and that is used for dipping or coating. An object may be immersed (or partially immersed) in a dip tank or it may be suspended in a vapor coming from the tank.</p><p class="depth0">Flammable liquid means any liquid having a flashpoint at or below 199.4   F (93 C).</p><p class="depth0">Flashpoint means the minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off a vapor in sufficient concentration to ignite if tested in accordance with the test methods in Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1200-Physical Hazard Criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Lower flammable limit (LFL) means the lowest concentration of a material that will propagate a flame. The LFL is usually expressed as a percent by volume of the material in air (or other oxidant).</p><p class="depth0">Vapor area means any space containing a dip tank, including its drain boards, associated drying or conveying equipment, and any surrounding area where the vapor concentration exceeds 25% of the LFL of the liquid in the tank.</p><p class="depth0">You means the employer, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.).
