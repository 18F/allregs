                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise authorized, licensed or directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which the Government of the Russian Federation has any interest that is directly related to the implementation of the HEU Agreements and that comes within the possession or control of a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in an account on the books of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account within the United States to an account held outside the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be made to another blocked account held in the same name. U.S. financial institutions are authorized to engage in routine currency exchange transfers involving funds directly associated with the implementation of the HEU agreements that flow through correspondence accounts in U.S. financial institutions.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 540.503. Please refer to Sec. 501.603 of this chapter for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers. See also Sec. 501.203 concerning the obligation to hold blocked funds in interest-bearing accounts.</p>
