                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> First rule of construction. The Act and the implementing  regulations in this part 617 shall be construed liberally so as to carry  out the purpose of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Second rule of construction. The Act and the implementing  regulations in this part 617 shall be construed so as to assure insofar  as possible the uniform interpretation and application of the Act and  this part 617 throughout the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effectuating purpose and rules of construction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To  effectuate the purpose of the Act and this part 617 and to assure  uniform interpretation and application of the Act and this part 617  throughout the United States, a State agency shall forward, not later  than 10 days after issuance, to the Department a copy of any judicial or  administrative decision ruling on an individual's entitlement to TAA  under this part 617. On request of the Department, a State agency shall  forward to the Department a copy of any determination or redetermination  ruling on an individual's entitlement to TAA under this part 617.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Department believes that a determination,  redetermination, or decision is inconsistent with the Department's  interpretation of the Act or this part 617, the Department may at any  time notify the State agency of the Department's view. Thereafter, the  State agency shall issue a redetermination or appeal if possible, and  shall not follow such determination, redetermination, or decision as a  precedent; and, in any subsequent proceedings which involve such  determination, redetermination, or decision, or wherein such  determination, redetermination, or decision is cited as precedent or  otherwise relied upon, the State agency shall inform the claims deputy  or hearing officer or court of the Department's view and shall make all  reasonable efforts, including appeal or other proceedings in an  appropriate forum, to obtain modification, limitation, or overruling of  the determination, redetermination, or decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Department believes that a determination,  redetermination, or decision is patently and flagrantly violative of the  Act or this part 617, the Department may at any time notify the State  agency of the Department's view. If the determination, redetermination,  or decision in question denies TAA to an individual, the steps outlined  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be followed by the State  agency. If the determination, redetermination, or decision in question  awards TAA to an individual, the benefits are ``due'' within the meaning  of section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1)),  and therefore must be paid promptly to the individual. However, the  State agency, shall take the steps outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, and payments to the individual may be temporarily delayed if  redetermination or appeal action is taken not more than one business day  following the day on which the first payment otherwise would be issued  to the individual; and the redetermination action is taken or appeal is  filed to obtain a reversal of the award of TAA and a ruling consistent  with the Department's view; and the redetermination action or appeal  seeks an expedited redetermination or appeal within not more than two  weeks after the redetermination action is taken or the appeal is filed.  If redetermination action is not taken or appeal is not filed within the  above time limit, or a redetermination or decision is not obtained  within the two-week limit, or any redetermination or decision or order  is issued which affirms the determination, redetermination, or decision  awarding TAA or allows it to stand in whole or in part, the benefits  awarded must be paid promptly to the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any determination, redetermination, or decision, referred  to in paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section, is treated  as a precedent for any future application for TAA, the Secretary will  decide whether the Agreement with the State entered into under the Act  and this part 617 shall be terminated and Sec. 617.59(f) applied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of any determination, redetermination, or decision  that is not legally warranted under the Act or this part 617, including  any determination, redetermination, or decision referred to in paragraph  (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Secretary will decide  whether the State shall be required to restore the funds of the United  States for any sums paid under such a determination, redetermination, or  decision, and whether, in the absence of such restoration, the Agreement  with the State shall be terminated and Sec. 617.59(f) applied and  whether other action shall be taken to recover such sums for the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State agency may request reconsideration of a notice issued  pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and  shall be given an opportunity to present views and arguments if desired.  Such request shall be made to the Secretary and may include views and  arguments on the matters to be decided by the Secretary under paragraph  (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Concurrence of the Department in a determination,  redetermination, or decision shall not be presumed from the absence of a  notice issued pursuant to this section.
