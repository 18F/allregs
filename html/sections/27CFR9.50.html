The Temecula Valley viticultural area is located in  Riverside County, California. The boundary is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning point is the northernmost point of the Santa Rosa  Land Grant where the Santa Rosa Land Grant boundary intersects the  easternmost point of the Cleveland National Forest boundary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The boundary follows the Cleveland National Forest boundary  southwesterly to the point where it converges with the Riverside County- San Diego County line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The boundary follows the Riverside County-San Diego County line  southwesterly, then southeasterly to the point where the Riverside  County-San Diego County line diverges southward and the Santa Rosa Land  Grant boundary continues southeasterly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The boundary follows the Santa Rosa Land Grant boundary  southeasterly, then northeasterly, to its intersection with the Temecula  Land Grant boundary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The boundary follows the Temecula Land Grant boundary  southeasterly, then northeasterly, to its intersection with the Little  Temecula Land Grant boundary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The boundary follows the Little Temecula Land

boundary follows this road west to the north-south section  line dividing Section 13 from Section 14 in Township 7 South, Range 2  West.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> The boundary follows this section line south to its  intersection with Buck Road (which coincides with the east-west section  line on the southern edge of Section 14 in Township 7 South, Range 2  West).</p><p
