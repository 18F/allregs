                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reclassification based on unsafe or unsound condition or  practice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issuance of notice of proposed reclassification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Grounds for reclassification. (A) Pursuant to 12 CFR 6.4(d), the OCC may  reclassify a well capitalized Federal savings association as adequately  capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized  institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower  capital category if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The OCC determines that the savings association is in an unsafe  or unsound condition; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The OCC deems the savings association to be engaged in an unsafe  or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall  hereinafter be referred to as ``reclassification.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior notice to institution. Prior to taking action pursuant to  12 CFR 6.4(d), the OCC shall issue and serve on the Federal savings  association a written notice of the OCC's intention to reclassify the  savings association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of notice. A notice of intention to reclassify a  Federal savings association based on unsafe or unsound condition shall  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the savings association's capital measures and  capital levels and the category to which the savings association would  be reclassified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons for reclassification of the savings association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date by which the savings association subject to the  notice of reclassification may file with the OCC a written appeal of the  proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which shall be at  least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the  OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the  financial condition of the savings association or other relevant  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Response to notice of proposed reclassification. A Federal  savings association may file a written response to a notice of proposed  reclassification within the time period set by the OCC. The response  should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An explanation of why the savings association is not in unsafe  or unsound condition or otherwise should not be reclassified; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances,  documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the  savings association or company regarding the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to file response. Failure by a Federal savings  association to file, within the specified time period, a written  response with the OCC to a notice of proposed reclassification shall  constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and shall constitute  consent to the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Request for hearing and presentation of oral testimony or  witnesses. The response may include a request for an informal hearing  before the OCC or its designee under this section. If the Federal  savings association desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at  the hearing, the savings association shall include a request to do so  with the request for an informal hearing. A request to present oral  testimony or witnesses shall specify the names of the witnesses and the  general nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing  shall constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to  request the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses shall  constitute a waiver of any right to present oral testimony or witnesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Order for informal hearing. Upon receipt of a timely written  request that includes a request for a hearing, the OCC shall issue an  order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days  after receipt of the request, unless the OCC allows further time at the  request of the Federal savings association. The hearing shall be held in  Washington, DC or at such other place as may be designated by the OCC,  before a presiding officer(s) designated by the OCC to conduct the  hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Hearing procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Federal savings association shall  have the right to introduce relevant written materials and to present  oral argument at the hearing. The savings association may introduce oral  testimony and present witnesses only if expressly authorized by the OCC  or the presiding officer(s). Neither the provisions of the  Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications  required by statute to be determined on the record nor parts 19 or 109  of this chapter apply to an informal hearing under this section unless  the OCC orders that such procedures shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The informal hearing shall be recorded and a transcript  furnished to the savings association upon request and payment of the  cost thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested  by a party or the presiding officer(s). The presiding officer(s) may ask  questions of any witness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The presiding officer(s) may order that the hearing be  continued for a reasonable period (normally five business days)  following completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional  written submissions to the hearing record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recommendation of presiding officers. Within 20 calendar days  following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are  closed, the presiding officer(s) shall make a recommendation to the OCC  on the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Time for decision. Not later than 60 calendar days after the  date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no  hearing was requested, the OCC will decide whether to reclassify the  Federal savings association and notify the savings association of the  OCC's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Request for rescission of reclassification. Any Federal savings  association that has been reclassified under this section, may, upon a  change in circumstances, request in writing that the OCC reconsider the  reclassification, and may propose that the reclassification be rescinded  and that any directives issued in connection with the reclassification  be modified, rescinded, or removed. Unless otherwise ordered by the OCC,  the savings association shall remain subject to the reclassification and  to any directives issued in connection with that reclassification while  such request is pending before the OCC.
