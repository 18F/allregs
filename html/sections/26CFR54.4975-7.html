                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loans to employee stock ownership plans--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions. When  used in this paragraph (b) and Sec. 54.4975-11, the terms listed below  have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ESOP. The term ``ESOP'' refers to an employee stock ownership  plan that meets the requirements of section 4975(e)(7) and Sec.  54.4975-11. It is not synonymous with ``stock bonus plan.'' A stock  bonus plan must, however, be an ESOP to engage in an exempt loan. The  qualification of an ESOP under section 401(a) and Sec. 54.4975-11 will  not be adversely affected merely because it engages in a non-exempt  loan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Loan. The term ``loan'' refers to a loan made to an ESOP by a  disqualified person or a loan to an ESOP which is guaranteed by a  disqualified person. It includes a direct loan of cash, a purchase-money  transaction, and an assumption of the obligation of an ESOP,  ``Guarantee'' includes an unsecured guarantee and the use of assets of a  disqualified person as collateral for a loan, even though the use of  assets may not be a guarantee under applicable state law. An amendment  of a loan in order to qualify as an exempt loan is not a refinancing of  the loan or the making of another loan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exempt loan. The term ``exempt loan'' refers to a loan that  satisfies the provisions of this paragraph (b). A ``nonexempt loan'' is  one that fails to satisfy such provisions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Publicly traded. The term ``publicly traded'' refers to a  security that is listed on a national securities exchange registered  under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f)  or that is quoted on a system sponsored by a national securities  association registered under section 15A(b) of the Securities Exchange  Act (15 U.S.C. 78o).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Qualifying employer security. The term ``qualifying employer  security'' refers to a security described in Sec. 54.4975-12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statutory exemption--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scope. Section 4975(d)(3) provides an  exemption from the excise tax imposed under section 4975 (a) and (b) by  reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E). Section 4975(d)(3) does  not provide an exemption from the imposition of such tax by reason of  section 4975(c)(1)(F), relating to fiduciaries receiving consideration  for their own personal account from any party dealing with a plan in  connection with a transaction involving the income or assets of the  plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> and  (iii) of this section. Also, fiduciaries should determine that the  transaction is truly arranged primarily in the interest of participants  and their beneficiaries rather than, for example, in the interest of  certain selling shareholders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Primary benefit requirement--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. An exempt loan must  be primarily for the benefit of the ESOP participants and their  beneficiaries. All the surrounding facts and circumstances, including  those described   in paragraph (b) (3) (ii) and (iii) of this section, will be considered  in determining whether the loan satisfies this requirement. However, no  loan will satisfy the requirement unless it satisfies the requirements  of paragraph (b) (4), (5), and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Net effect on plan assets. At the time that a loan is made, the  interest rate for the loan and the price of securities to be acquired  with the loan proceeds should not be such that plan assets might be  drained off.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Arm's-length standard. The terms of a loan, whether or not  between independent parties, must, at the same time the loan is made, be  at least as favorable to the ESOP as the terms of a comparable loan  resulting from arm's-length negotiations between independent parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of loan proceeds. The proceeds of an exempt loan must be  used within a reasonable time after their receipt by the borrowing ESOP  only for any or all of the following purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To acquire qualifying employer securities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To repay such loan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To repay a prior exempt loan. A new loan, the proceeds of  which are so used, must satisfy the provisions of this paragraph (b).  Except as provided in paragraph (b) (9) and (10) of this section or as  otherwise required by applicable law, no security acquired with the  proceeds of an exempt loan may be subject to a put, call, or other  option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement while held by and when  distributed from a plan, whether or not the plan is then an ESOP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Liability and collateral of ESOP for loan. An exempt loan must  be without recourse against the ESOP. Furthermore, the only assets of  the ESOP that may be given as collateral on an exempt loan are  qualifying employer securities of two classes: those acquired with the  proceeds of the loan and those that were used as collateral on a prior  exempt loan repaid with the proceeds of the current exempt loan. No  person entitled to payment under the exempt loan shall have any right to  assets of the ESOP other than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Collateral given for the loan,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributions (other than contributions of employers  securities) that are made under an ESOP to meet its obligations under  the loan, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Earnings attributable to such collateral and the investment of  such contributions.  The payments made with respect to an exempt loan by the ESOP during a  plan year must not exceed an amount equal to the sum of such  contributions and earnings received during or prior to the year less  such payments in prior years. Such contributions and earnings must be  accounted for separately in the books of account of the ESOP until the  loan is repaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em>, the making of a  guarantee does not make a person a lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reasonable rate of interest. The interest rate of a loan must  not be in excess of a reasonable rate of interest. All relevant factors  will be considered in determining a reasonable rate of interest,  including the amount and duration of the loan, the security and  guarantee (if any) involved, the credit standing of the ESOP and the  guarantor (if any), and the interest rate prevailing for comparable  loans. When these factors are considered, a variable interest rate may  be reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Release from encumbrance--(i) General rule. In general, an  exempt loan must provide for the release from encumbrance under this  subdivision </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of plan assets used as collateral for the loan. For each  plan year during the duration of the loan, the number of securities  released must equal the number of encumbered securities held immediately  before release for the current plan year multiplied by a fraction. The  numerator of the fraction is the amount of principal and interest paid  for the year. The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the  numerator plus the principal and interest to be paid for all future  years. See Sec. 54.4975-7(b) (8) (iv). The number of future years   under the loan must be definitely ascertainable and must be determined  without taking into account any possible extensions or renewal periods.  If the interest rate under the loan is variable, the interest to be paid  in future years must be computed by using the interest rate applicable  as of the end of the plan year. If collateral includes more than one  class of securities, the number of securities of each class to be  released for a plan year must be determined by applying the same  fraction to each class.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> is not applicable from the  time that, by reason of a renewal, extension, or refinancing, the sum of  the expired duration of the exempt loan, the renewal period, the  extension period, and the duration of a new exempt loan exceeds 10  years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Caution against plan disqualification. Under an exempt loan,  the number of securities released from encumbrance may vary from year to  year. The release of securities depends upon certain employer  contributions and earnings under the ESOP. Under Sec. 54.4975-11(d)(2)  actual allocations to participants' accounts are based upon assets  withdrawn from the suspense account. Nevertheless, for purposes of  applying the limitations under section 415 to these allocations, under  Sec. 54.4975-11(a)(8)(ii) contributions used by the ESOP to pay the  loan are treated as annual additions to participants' accounts.  Therefore, particular caution must be exercised to avoid exceeding the  maximum annual additions under section 415. At the same time, release  from encumbrance in annual varying numbers may reflect a failure on the  part of the employer to make substantial and recurring contributions to  the ESOP which will lead to loss of qualification under section 401(a).  The Internal Revenue Service will observe closely the operation of  ESOP's that release encumbered securities in varying annual amounts,  particularly those that provide for the deferral of loan payments or for  balloon payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Illustration. The general rule under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of  this section operates as illustrated in the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. Corporation X establishes an ESOP that borrows $750,000  from a bank. X guarantees the loan, which is for 15 years at 5% interest  and is payable in level annual amounts of $72,256.72. Total payments on  the loan are $1,083,850.80. The ESOP uses the entire loan proceeds to  acquire 15,000 shares of X stock which is used as collateral for the  loan. The number of securities to be released for the first year is  1,000 shares, i.e., 15,000 shares x $72,256.72/$1,083,850.80 = 15,000  shares x 1/15. The number of securities to be released for the second  year is 1,000 shares, i.e., 14,000 shares x $72,256.72/$1,011,594.08 =  14,000 shares x 1/14. If all loan payments are made as originally  scheduled, the number of securities released in each succeeding year of  the loan will also be 1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em>. Securities subject to such right must be stock or  an equity security, or a debt security convertible into stock or an  equity security. Also, the securities must not be publicly traded at the  time the right may be exercised. The right of first refusal must be in  favor of the employer, the ESOP, or both in any order of priority. The  selling price and other terms under the right must not be less favorable  to the seller than the greater of the value of the security determined  under Sec. 54.4975-11(d)(5), or the purchase price and other terms  offered by a buyer, other than the employer or the ESOP, making a good  faith offer to purchase the security. The right of first refusal must   lapse no later than 14 days after the security holder gives written  notice to the holder of the right that an offer by a third party to  purchase the security has been received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em>, participant means a participant and beneficiaries of the  participant under the ESOP.) The put option must permit a participant to  put the security to the employer. Under no circumstances may the put  option bind the ESOP. However, it may grant the ESOP an option to assume  the rights and obligations of the employer at the time that the put  option is exercised. If it is known at the time a loan is made that  Federal or state law will be violated by the employer's honoring such  put option, the put option must permit the security to be put, in a  manner consistent with such law, to a third party (e.g., an affiliate of  the employer or a shareholder other than the ESOP) that has substantial  net worth at the time the loan is made and whose net worth is reasonably  expected to remain substantial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Duration of put option--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A put option must be  exercisable at least during a 15-month period which begins on the date  the security subject to the put option is distributed by the ESOP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. In the case of a security that is publicly traded  without restriction when distributed but ceases to be so traded within  15 months after distribution, the employer must notify each security  holder in writing on or before the tenth day after the date the security  ceases to be so traded that for the remainder of the 15-month period the  security is subject to a put option. The number of days between such  tenth day and the date on which notice is actually given, if later than  the tenth day, must be added to the duration of the put option. The  notice must inform distributees of the terms of the put options that  they are to hold. Such terms must satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (b) (10) through (12) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Other put option provisions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manner of exercise. A put  option is exercised by the holder notifying the employer in writing that  the put option is being exercised.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Time excluded from duration of put option. The period during  which a put option is exercisable does not include any time when a  distributee is unable to exercise it because the party bound by the put  option is prohibited from honoring it by applicable Federal or state  law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Price. The price at which a put option must be exercisable is  the value of the security, determined under Sec. 54.4975-11(d)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Payment terms. The provisions for payment under a put option  must be reasonable. The deferral of payment is reasonable if adequate  security and a reasonable interest rate are provided for any credit  extended and if the cumulative payments at any time are no less than the  aggregate of reasonable periodic payments as of such time. Periodic  payments are reasonable if annual installments, beginning with 30 days  after the date the put option is excercised, are substantially equal.  Generally, the payment period may not end more than 5 years after the  date the put option is exercised. However, it may be extended to a date  no later than the earlier of 10 years from the date the put option is  exercised or the date the proceeds of the loan used by the ESOP to  acquire the security subject to the put option are entirely repaid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Payment restrictions. Payment under a put option may be  restricted by the terms of a loan, including one used to acquire a  security subject to a   put option made before November 1, 1977. Otherwise, payment under a put  option must not be restricted by the provisions of a loan or any other  arrangement, including the terms of the employer's articles of  incorporation, unless so required by applicable state law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Other terms of loan. An exempt loan must be for a specific  term. Such loan may not be payable at the demand of any person, except  in the case of default.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Status of plan as ESOP. To be exempt, a loan must be made to a  plan that is an ESOP at the time of such loan. However, a loan to a plan  formally designated as an ESOP at the time of the loan that fails to be  an ESOP because it does not comply with section 401(a) of the Code or  Sec. 54.4975-11 will be exempt as of the time of such loan if the plan  is amended retroactively under section 401(b) or Sec. 54.4975-11(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Special rules for certain loans--(i) Loans made before January  1, 1976. A loan made before January 1, 1976, or made afterwards under a  binding agreement in effect on January 1, 1976 (or under renewals  permitted by the terms of the agreement on that date) is exempt for the  entire period of the loan if it otherwise satisfies the provisions of  this paragraph (b) for such period, even though it does not satisfy the  following provisions of this section: the last sentence of paragraph (b)  (4) and all of paragraph (b) (5), (6), (8) </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> and (ii), and (9) through  (13), inclusive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Release rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) (15) (i) and (ii)  of this section, if the proceeds of a loan are used to acquire  securities after November 1, 1977, the loan must comply by such date  with the provisions of paragraph (b) (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Default rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) (15) (i) and (ii)  of this section, a loan by a disqualified person other than a guarantor  must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) (6) of this section. A loan  will meet these requirements if it is retroactively amended before  November 1, 1977 to meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Put option rule. With respect to a security distributed before  November 1, 1977, the put option provisions of paragraph (b) (10), (11),  and (12) of this section will be deemed satisfied as of the date the  security is distributed if by December 31, 1977, the security is subject  to a put option satisfying such provisions, the security is subject to a  put option satisfying such provisions. For purposes of satisfying such  provisions, the security will be deemed distributed on the date the put  option is issued. However, the put option provisions need not be  satisfied with respect to a security that is not owned on November 1,  1977, by a person in whose hands a put option must be exercisable.
