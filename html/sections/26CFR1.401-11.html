                                Sec. 1.401-11  General rules relating to plans covering self-employed
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section provides certain rules which  supplement, and modify, the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.401-1 through 1.401-9  in the case of a qualified pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan  which covers a self-employed individual who is an employee within the  meaning of section 401(c)(1). The provisions of this section apply to  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962. Except as otherwise  provided, paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section apply to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1962. Paragraph (n) of this section  applies to plan years determined in accordance with paragraph (n)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of Sec.  1.401-1) since earned income is dependent upon the profits of the trade  or business with respect to which the plan is established. Thus, for  example, a plan, which provides that the employer will contribute 10  percent of the earned income of a self-employed individual but no more  than $2,500, and that the employer contribution on behalf of common-law  employees shall be the same percentage of their salaries as the  contribution on behalf of the self-employed individual bears to his  earned income, is a profit-sharing plan, since the amount of the  employer's contribution for common-   law employees covered under the plan is related to the earned income of  a self-employed individual and thereby to the profits of the trade or  business. On the other hand, for example, a plan which defines the  compensation of any self-employed individual as his earned income and  which provides that the employer will contribute 10 percent of the  compensation of each employee covered under the plan is a pension plan  since the contribution on behalf of common-law employees is fixed  without regard to whether the self-employed individual has earned income  or the amount thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962 (76  Stat. 809) permits self-employed individuals to be treated as employees  and therefore included in qualified plans, but it is clear that such law  requires such self-employed individuals to provide benefits for their  employees on a nondiscriminatory basis. Self-employed individuals will  not be considered as providing contributions or benefits for an employee  to the extent that the wages or salary of the employee covered under the  plan are reduced at or about the time the plan is adopted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to permitting self-employed individuals to  participate in qualified plans, the Self-Employed Individuals Tax  Retirement Act of 1962 extends to such individuals some of the tax  benefits allowed common-law employee-participants in such plans.  However, the tax benefits allowed a self-employed individual are  restricted by the limits which are placed on the deductions allowed for  contributions on such an individual's behalf. In view of these  restrictions on the tax benefits extended to any self-employed  individual, a self-employed individual participating in a qualified plan  may not participate in any forfeitures. Therefore, in the case of a  qualified plan which covers any self-employed individual, a separate  account must be established for each self-employed individual to which  no forfeitures can be allocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements as to coverage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general, section 401(a)(3)  and the regulations thereunder prescribe the coverage requirements which  a qualified plan must satisfy. However, if such a plan covers self- employed individuals who are not owner-employees, it must, in addition  to satisfying such requirements, satisfy the requirements of this  paragraph. If any owner-employee is covered under a qualified plan, the  provisions of this paragraph do not apply, but the provisions of section  401(d), including section 401(d)(3), do apply (see Sec. 1.401-12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 401(a)(3)(B) provides that a plan may satisfy the  coverage requirements for qualification if it covers such employees as  qualify under a classification which is found not to discriminate in  favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, persons whose  principal duties consist in supervising the work of other employees, or  highly compensated employees. Section 401(a)(5) sets forth certain  classifications that will not in themselves be considered  discriminatory. Under such section, a classification which excludes all  employees whose entire remuneration constitutes ``wages'' under section  3121(a)(1), will not be considered discriminatory merely because of such  exclusion. Similarly, a plan which includes all employees will not be  considered discriminatory solely because the contributions or benefits  based on that part of their remuneration which is excluded from  ``wages'' under section 3121(a)(1) differ from the contributions or  benefits based on that part of their remuneration which is not so  excluded. However, in determining if a classification is discriminatory  under section 401(a)(3)(B), consideration will be given to whether the  total benefits resulting to each employee under the plan and under the  Social Security Act, or under the Social Security Act only, establish an  integrated and correlated retirement system satisfying the tests of  section 401(a). A plan which covers self-employed individuals, none of  whom is an owner-employee, may also be integrated with the contributions  or benefits under the Social Security Act. In such a case, the portion  of the earned income (as defined in section 401(c)(2)) of such an  individual which does not exceed the maximum amount which may be treated  as self-employment income under section 1402(b)(1), and which is derived  from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is   established, shall be treated as ``wages'' under section 3121(a)(1)  subject to the tax imposed by section 3111 (relating to the tax on  employers) for purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of  Sec. 1.401-3, relating to the determination of whether a plan is  properly integrated. However, if the plan covers an owner-employee, the  rules relating to the integration of the plan with the contributions or  benefits under the Social Security Act contained in paragraph (b) of  Sec. 1.401-12 apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Certain of the classifications enumerated in section 401(a)(5)  do not apply to plans which provide contributions or benefits for any  self-employed individual. Since self-employed individuals are not  salaried or clerical employees, the provision in section 401(a)(5)  permitting a plan, in certain cases to cover only this type of employee  is inapplicable to plans which cover any self-employed individual.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The classifications enumerated in section 401(a)(5) are not  exclusive, and it is not necessary that a qualified plan cover all  employees or all full-time employees. Plans may qualify even though  coverage is limited in accordance with a particular classification  incorporated in the plan, provided the effect of covering only such  employees as satisfy such eligibility requirement does not result in the  prohibited discrimination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Discrimination as to contributions or benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  In order for a plan to be qualified, there must be no discrimination in  contributions or benefits in favor of employees who are officers,  shareholders, supervisors, or highly compensated, as against other  employees whether within or without the plan. A self-employed  individual, by reason of the contingent nature of his compensation, is  considered to be a highly-compensated employee, and thus is a member of  the group in whose favor discrimination is prohibited. In determining  whether the prohibited discrimination exists, the total employer  contribution on behalf of a self-employed individual shall be taken into  account regardless of the fact that only a portion of such contribution  is allowed as a deduction. For additional rules relating to  discrimination as to contributions or benefits with regard to plans  covering any owner-employee, see Sec. 1.401-12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Base for computing contributions or benefits. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A plan which  is otherwise qualified is not considered discriminatory merely because  the contributions or benefits provided under the plan bear a uniform  relationship to the total compensation, basic compensation, or regular  rate of compensation of the employees, including self-employed  individuals, covered under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a self-employed individual who is covered under  a qualified plan, the total compensation of such individual is the  earned income (as defined in section 401(c)(2)) which such individual  derives from the employer's trade or business, or trades or businesses,  with respect to which the qualified plan is established. Thus, for  example, in the case of a partner, his total compensation includes both  his distributive share of partnership income, whether or not  distributed, and guaranteed payments described in section 707(c) made to  him by the partnership establishing the plan, to the extent that such  income constitutes earned income as defined in section 401(c)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The basic or regular rate of compensation of any self- employed individual is that portion of his earned income which bears the  same ratio to his total earned income derived from the trade or  business, or trades or businesses, with respect to which the qualified  plan is established as the aggregate basic or regular compensation of  all common-law employees covered under the plan bears to the aggregate  total compensation of such employees derived from such trade or  business, or trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If an employer establishes two or more plans which satisfy the  requirements of section 401(a) separately, and only one such plan covers  a self-employed individual, the determination of the basic or regular  rate of compensation of such self-employed individual is made with  regard to the compensation of common-law employees covered under the  plan which provides contributions or benefits for such self-employed  individual. On the other hand, if two or more plans must be considered   together in order to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a), the  computation of the basic or regular rate of compensation of a self- employed individual must be made with regard to the compensation of the  common-law employees covered by so many of such plans as are required to  be taken together in order to satisfy the qualification requirements of  section 401(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Discriminatory contributions. If a discriminatory contribution  is made by, or for, a self-employed individual who is an employee within  the meaning of section 401(c)(1) because of an erroneous assumption as  to the earned income of such individual, the plan will not be considered  discriminatory if adequate adjustment is made to remove such  discrimination. In the case of any self-employed individual who is an  owner-employee, the amount of any excess contribution to be returned and  the manner in which it is to be repaid are determined by the provisions  of section 401(d)(8) and (e). However, if any self-employed individual,  including any owner-employee, has not made the full contribution  permitted to be made on his behalf as an employee, then, if the plan  expressly provides, so much of any excess contribution by such self- employed individual's employer as may, under the provisions of the plan,  be treated as a contribution made by such individual as an employee can  be so treated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distribution of entire interest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a trust forms part of a  plan which covers a self-employed individual, such trust shall  constitute a qualified trust under section 401 only if the plan of which  such trust is a part expressly provides that the entire interest of each  employee, including any common-law employee, will be distributed in  accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph  apply, the entire interest of each employee (including contributions he  has made on his own behalf, contributions made on his behalf by his  employer, and interest thereon) must be actually distributed to such  employee--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an employee, other than an individual who is, or  has been, an owner-employee under the plan, not later than the last day  of the taxable year of such employee in which he attains the age of  70\1/2\, or not later than the last day of the taxable year in which  such employee retires, whichever is later, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an employee who is, or has been, an owner- employee under the plan, not later than the last day of the taxable year  in which he attains the age of 70\1/2\.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In lieu of distributing an employee's entire interest in a  qualified plan as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such  interest may be distributed commencing no later than the last taxable  year described in such subparagraph (2). In such case, the plan must  expressly provide that the entire interest of such an employee shall be  distributed to him and his beneficiaries, in a manner which satisfies  the requirements of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, over any of the  following periods (or any combination thereof)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The life of the employee, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lives of the employee and his spouse, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A period certain not longer than the life expectancy of the  employee, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A period certain not longer than the joint life and last  survivor expectancy of the employee and his spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of subparagraphs (3) and (5) of this paragraph, the  determination of the life expectancy of the employee or the joint life  and last survivor expectancy of the employee and his spouse is to be  made either (i) only once, at the time the employee receives the first  distribution of his entire interest under the plan, or (ii)  periodically, in a consistent manner. Such life expectancy or joint life  and last survivor expectancy cannot exceed the period computed by the  use of the expected return multiples in Sec. 1.72-9, or, in the case of  payments under a contract issued by an insurance company, the period  computed by use of the life expectancy tables of such company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an employee's entire interest is to be distributed over a  period described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, then the amount  to be distributed each year must be at least an amount equal to the  quotient obtained by dividing the entire interest of the   employee under the plan at the time the distribution is made (expressed  in either dollars or units) by the life expectancy of the employee, or  joint life and last survivor expectancy of the employee and his spouse  (whichever is applicable), determined in accordance with the provisions  of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. However, no distribution need be  made in any year, or a lesser amount may be distributed, if the  aggregate amounts distributed by the end of that year are at least equal  to the aggregate of the minimum amounts required by this subparagraph to  have been distributed by the end of such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If an employee's entire interest is distributed in the form of  an annuity contract, then the requirements of section 401(a)(9) are  satisfied if the distribution of such contract takes place before the  end of the latest taxable year described in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, and if the employee's interest will be paid over a period  described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and at a rate which  satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The requirements of section 401(a)(9) do not preclude  contributions from being made on behalf of an owner-employee under a  qualified plan subsequent to the taxable year in which the distribution  of his entire interest is required to commence. Thus, if all other  requirements for qualification are satisfied, a qualified plan may  provide contributions for an owner-employee who has already attained age  70\1/2\. However, a distribution of benefits attributable to  contributions made on behalf of an owner-employee in a taxable year  beginning after the taxable year in which he attains the age of 70\1/2\  must satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.  Thus, if an owner-employee has already attained the age of 70\1/2\ at  the time the first contribution is made on his behalf, the distribution  of his entire interest must commence in the year in which such  contribution is first made on his behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> This paragraph shall not apply and an otherwise qualified trust  will not be disqualified if the method of distribution under the plan is  one which was designated by a common-law employee prior to October 10,  1962, and such method of distribution is not in accordance with the  provisions of section 401(a)(9). Such exception applies regardless of  whether the actual distribution of the entire interest of an employee  making such a designation, or any portion of such interest, has  commenced prior to October 10, 1962.  [T.D. 6675, 28 FR 10124, Sept. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6982, 33 FR  16500, Nov. 13, 1968]</p>
