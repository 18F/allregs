                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of this part is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful

devices intended for human use, and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose. This part provides procedures for the conduct of clinical investigations of devices. An approved investigational device exemption (IDE) permits a device that otherwise would be required to comply with a performance standard or to have premarket approval to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting investigations of that device. An IDE approved under Sec. 812.30 or considered approved under Sec. 812.2(b) exempts a device from the requirements of the following sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and regulations issued thereunder: Misbranding under section 502 of the act, registration, listing, and premarket notification under section 510, performance standards under section 514, premarket approval under section 515, a banned device regulation under section 516, records and reports under section 519, restricted device requirements under section 520(e), good manufacturing practice requirements under section 520(f) except for the requirements found in Sec. 820.30, if applicable (unless the sponsor states an intention to comply with these requirements under Sec. 812.20(b)(3) or Sec. 812.140(b)(4)(v)) and color additive requirements under section 721.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21, unless otherwise noted.
