                            <p class="depth0">In instances where NIGC has concluded its investigation of a particular matter and will not recommend the commencement of an enforcement proceeding against a respondent at that

time, the Commission's authorized representative, in his or her discretion, may advise the party by letter that the investigation has been completed. An investigation completion letter does not constitute a finding that no violation of IGRA, NIGC regulations, or a tribe's approved gaming ordinance occurred. Further, an investigation completion letter does not preclude the reopening of an investigation or the initiation of an enforcement action by the Chair.
