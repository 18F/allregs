                            <p class="depth0">If the account is to be paid to the child or children, or to  descendants of deceased children by representation, as provided in  Sec. 1651.2(a)(3), the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Child. A child includes a natural or adopted child of the  deceased participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Descendants of deceased children. ``By representation'' means  that, if a child of the participant dies before the participant, all  descendants of the deceased child at the same level will equally divide  the deceased child's share of the participant's account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adoption by another. A natural child of a TSP participant who  has been adopted by someone other than the participant during the  participant's lifetime will not be considered the child of the  participant, unless the adopting parent is the spouse of the TSP  participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Parentage disputes. If the identity of the father or mother of a  child is in dispute or otherwise unclear (e.g., only one parent is  listed on a birth certificate), the purported child must submit to the  TSP either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A court order or other administrative finding establishing  parentage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation sufficient for establishing parentage under the  law of the state in which the participant was domiciled at the time of  death.
