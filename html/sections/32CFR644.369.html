                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Detailed guidelines are provided in FPMR Subsection 101-47.4913.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculated risk. These guidelines, which are binding on holding  agencies, embody the principle of calculated risk. In applying this  principle, the anticipated losses and deteriorations, including  pilferage and vandalism, in terms of realizable values are expected to  be less than expenditures to minimize the risks. Normally, where  property is of little value, only periodic surveillance is necessary and  care and custody forces will not be maintained. However, where property,  regardless of realizable value, is potentially an attractive nuisance to  children and curiosity seekers, or is inherently dangerous, the public  should be protected by guards stationed on the property or by other  satisfactory means. Every effort should be made to minimize the cost of  care, protection and maintenance consistent with these principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Improvements or alterations. FPMR Subsection 101-47.401-5,  provides that improvements and alterations to excess and surplus real  property may be considered, with the prior approval of GSA, where  disposal cannot be made. However, it is not considered likely that a  situation will arise in the Corps' disposal operations where such  improvements or alterations can be justified. Repairs necessary for  protection   and maintenance of marketable property will not be undertaken except to  prevent serious loss to the Government. Excess equipment or facilities  should not be updated or improved. At predisposal conferences, or  earlier where practicable, the DE, in coordination with GSA  representatives, will furnish specific guidance to the using command as  to the minimum acceptable GSA requirement for care and custody. The  requirement for minimum maintenance does not extend to historic places.  Historic places in excess or suplus status will be maintained in  accordance with the letter and spirit of approved Department of the Army  criteria for protection, preservation and maintenance of historic  places.</p>
