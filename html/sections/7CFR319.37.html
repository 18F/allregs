Sec.  319.37-2a  Taxa of regulated plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination by the Administrator. The importation of certain taxa of plants for planting poses a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States. Therefore, the importation of these taxa is not authorized pending the completion of a pest risk analysis, except as provided in Sec.  319.37-2(c). Lists of these taxa may be found on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/plants/plant--imports/Q37--nappra.shtml. There are two lists of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis: A list of taxa of plants for planting that are quarantine pests, and a list of taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests. For taxa of plants for planting that have been determined to be quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa. For taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa, the foreign places from which the taxa's importation is not authorized, and the quarantine pests of concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Addition of taxa. A taxon of plants for planting may be added to one of the lists of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis under this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data sheet. APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice that announces our determination that a taxon of plants for planting is either a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. This notice will make available a data sheet that details the scientific evidence APHIS evaluated in making the determination that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. The data sheet will include references to the scientific evidence that APHIS used in making the determination. In our notice, we will provide for a public comment period of a minimum of 60 days on our addition to the list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Response to comments. (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the taxon will be added to the list of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No comments were received on the data sheet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The comments on the data sheet revealed that no changes to the data sheet were necessary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Changes to the data sheet were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect APHIS' determination that the taxon poses a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If comments present information that leads us to determine that the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States, APHIS will not add the taxon to the list of plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis. APHIS will issue a notice giving public notice of this determination after the close of the comment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Criterion for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a quarantine pest. A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a quarantine pest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a host of a quarantine pest. A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a host of a quarantine pest. The following criteria must be fulfilled in order to make this determination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plant pest in question must be determined to be a quarantine pest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxon of plants for planting must be determined to be a host of that quarantine pest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Removing a taxon from the list of taxa not authorized pending pest risk analysis. (1) Requests to remove a taxon from the list of taxa not authorized pending pest risk analysis must be made in accordance with Sec.  319.5 of this part. APHIS will conduct a pest risk analysis in response to such a request. The pest risk analysis will examine the

risk associated with the importation of that taxon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be prohibited or allowed subject to special restrictions, such as a systems approach, treatment, or postentry quarantine, APHIS will publish a proposed rule making the pest risk analysis available to the public and proposing to take the action recommended by the pest risk analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to the general restrictions of this subpart, APHIS will publish a notice announcing our intent to remove the taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis and making the pest risk analysis supporting the taxon's removal available for public review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will be subject only to the general restrictions of this subpart if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions of the analysis and the Administrator's determination that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If information presented by commenters indicates that the pest risk analysis needs to be revised, APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will continue to be listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis while the information presented by commenters is analyzed and incorporated into the pest risk analysis. APHIS will subsequently publish a new notice announcing the availability of the revised pest risk analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> APHIS may also remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis when APHIS determines that the evidence used to add the taxon to the list was erroneous (for example, involving a taxonomic misidentification).

Sec.  319.40-11  Plant pest risk assessment standards.</p><p class="depth0">When evaluating a request to import a regulated article not allowed importation under this subpart, or a request to import a regulated article under conditions other than those prescribed by this subpart, APHIS will conduct the following analysis to determine the plant pest risks associated with each requested importation in order to determine whether or not to issue a permit under this subpart or to propose regulations establishing conditions for the importation into the United States of the regulated article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Collecting commodity information. (1) APHIS will evaluate the application for information describing the regulated article and the origin, processing, treatment, and handling of the regulated article; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with the regulated article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cataloging quarantine pests. For the regulated article specified in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and capable of further dissemination in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Native species of the United States that has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determining which quarantine pests to assess. (1) APHIS will divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b)

of this section into groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. The plant pests would be grouped as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plant pests found on the bark;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plant pests found under the bark; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plant pests found in the wood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into associated taxa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph (c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously been performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct individual plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, starting with the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments. APHIS will evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, or in the regulated article at the time of importation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in transit on the regulated article and entering the United States undetected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once it has entered into the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond any colonized area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant pest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk. APHIS will develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they would allow safe importation of the regulated article. The requirements of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart_Indian Corn or Maize, Broomcorn, and Related Plants</p><p class="depth0">Quarantine</p>
