If a document referred to in Sec. 113.42 is not produced within 120 days from the date of the transaction in connection with which the bond was given, the port director, in his discretion, upon written application of the importer, may extend the period for one further period of 2 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Late application. No application for the extension of the period of any bond given to assure the production of a missing document shall be allowed by the port director if the application is received later than 2 months after the expiration of the period of the bond, and any extension shall not be allowed by the port director for a period of more than 2 months from the date of expiration of the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptance of a free-entry or reduced-duty document prior to liquidation. When a bond is given for the production of any free-entry or reduced-duty document and a satisfactory document is produced prior to liquidation of the entry or within the period during which a valid reliquidation may be completed, provided the failure to file was not due to willful negligence or fraudulent intent, it shall be accepted as satisfying the requirement that it be filed in connection with the entry, and the bond charge for its production shall be cancelled.
