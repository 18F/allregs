                            <p class="depth0">Poultry must be more than 4 months of age when tested for an  official classification: Provided, That turkey candidates under subpart  D of this part may be tested at more than 12 weeks of age; game bird  candidates under subpart E of this part may be tested when more than 4  months of age or upon reaching sexual maturity, whichever comes first;  and ostrich, emu, rhea, and cassowary candidates under subpart F of this  part may be tested when more than 12 months of age. Samples for official  tests shall be collected by an Authorized Agent, Authorized Testing  Agent, or State Inspector and tested by an authorized laboratory, except  that the stained antigen, rapid whole-blood test for pullorum-typhoid  may be conducted by an Authorized Testing Agent or State Inspector. For  Plan programs in which a representative sample may be tested in lieu of  an entire flock, except the ostrich, emu, rhea, and cassowary program in  Sec. 145.63(a), the minimum number tested shall be 30 birds per house,  with at least 1 bird taken from each pen and unit in the house. The  ratio of male to female birds in representative samples of birds from  meat-type chicken, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird flocks  must be the same as the ratio of male to female birds in the flock. In  houses containing fewer than 30 birds other than ostriches, emus, rheas,  and cassowaries, all birds in the house must be tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For Pullorum-Typhoid. (1) The official blood tests for pullorum- typhoid shall be the standard tube agglutination test, the  microagglutination test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test  (ELISA), or the rapid serum test for all poultry; and the stained  antigen, rapid whole-blood test for all poultry except turkeys. Official  blood tests must be conducted in accordance with part 147 of this  subchapter or according to literature provided by the producer. Only  antigens approved by the Department and of the polyvalent type shall be  used for the rapid whole-blood and tube agglutination tests. Each serial  of tube antigen shall be submitted by the antigen producer to the  Department for approval upon manufacture and once a year thereafter as  long as antigen from that serial continues to be made available for use.  All microtest antigens and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reagents  shall also be approved by the Department. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The criteria and procedures for Department approval of antigens  and reagents may be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service, Veterinary Services, Center for Veterinary Biologics, 510 South  17th Street, Suite 104, Ames, IA 50010-8197. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There shall be an interval of at least 21 days between any  official blood test and any previous test with pullorum-typhoid antigen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The official blood test shall include the testing of a sample of  blood from each bird in the flock: Provided, That under specified  conditions (see applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 145.23, 145.33,  145.43, 145.53 and 145.63) the testing of a   portion or sample of the birds may be used in lieu of testing each bird.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Poultry from flocks undergoing qualification testing for  participation in the Plan that have a positive reaction to an official  blood test named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be evaluated  for pullorum-typhoid as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Serum samples that react on rapid serum test or enzyme-labeled  immunosorbent assay test (ELISA), or blood from birds that react on the  stained antigen, rapid whole-blood test for all birds except turkeys,  shall be tested with either the standard tube agglutination test or the  microagglutination test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reactors to the standard tube agglutination test (in dilutions  of 1:50 or greater) or the microagglutination test (in dilutions of 1:40  or greater) shall be submitted to an authorized laboratory for  bacteriological examination. If there are more than four reactors in a  flock, a minimum of four reactors shall be submitted to the authorized  laboratory; if the flock has four or fewer reactors, all of the reactors  must be submitted. Bacteriological examination must be conducted in  accordance with part 147 of this subchapter. When reactors are submitted  to the authorized laboratory within 10 days of the date of reading an  official blood test named in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, and  the bacteriological examination fails to demonstrate pullorum-typhoid  infection, the Official State Agency shall presume that the flock has no  pullorum-typhoid reactors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a flock owner does not wish to submit reactors for  bacteriological examination, then the reactors shall be isolated and  retested within 30 days using an official blood test named in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. If this retest is positive, additional  examination of the reactors and flock will be performed in accordance  with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. During this 30-day period,  the flock must be maintained under a security system, specified or  approved by the Official State Agency, that will prevent physical  contact with other birds and assure that personnel, equipment, and  supplies that could be a source of pullorum-typhoid spread are  sanitized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When S. pullorum or S. gallinarum organisms are isolated by an  authorized laboratory from baby poultry, or from fluff samples produced  by hatching eggs, the infected flock shall qualify for participation in  the Plan with two consecutive negative results to an official blood test  named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A succeeding flock must be  qualified for participation in the Plan's pullorum-typhoid program with  a negative result to an official blood test named in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section. Testing to qualify flocks for Plan participation must  include the testing of all birds in infected flocks and succeeding  flocks for a 12-month period, and shall be performed or physically  supervised by a State Inspector; Provided, That at the discretion of the  Official State Agency, a sample of at least 500 birds, rather than all  birds in the flock, may be tested by the State Inspector if it is agreed  upon by the Official State Agency, the flockowner, and the  Administrator. If the State Inspector determines that a primary breeding  flock has been exposed to S. pullorum or S. gallinarum, \2\ the Official  State Agency shall require: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ In making determinations of exposure, the State Inspector shall  evaluate both evidence proving that exposure occurred and circumstances  indicating a high probability of contacts with: infected wild birds;  contaminated feed or waste; or birds, equipment, supplies, or persons  from or exposed to flocks infected with S. pullorum or S. gallinarum. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taking of blood samples--performed by or in the presence of  a State Inspector--from all birds on premises exposed to birds,  equipment, supplies, or personnel from the primary breeding flock during  the period when the State Inspector determined that exposure to S.  pullorum or S. gallinarum occurred. \2\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The banding of all birds of these premises--performed or  physically supervised by a State Inspector--in order to identify any  bird that tests positive; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The testing of blood samples at an authorized laboratory using  an official blood test named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> All domesticated fowl, except waterfowl, on the farm of the  participant shall either be properly tested to meet   the same standards as the participating flock or these birds and their  eggs shall be separated from the participating flock and its eggs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All tests for pullorum-typhoid in flocks participating in or  candidates for participation in the Plan shall be reported to the  Official State Agency within 10 days following the completion of such  tests. All reactors shall be considered in determining the  classification of the flock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any drug, for which there is scientific evidence of masking the  test reaction or hindering the bacteriological recovery of Salmonella  organisms, shall not be fed or administered to poultry within 3 weeks  prior to a test or bacteriological examination upon which a Salmonella  classification is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> When suitable evidence, as determined by the Official State  Agency or the State Animal Disease Control Official, indicates that baby  or started poultry produced by participating hatcheries are infected  with organisms for which the parent flock received an official control  classification and this evidence indicates that the infection was  transmitted from the parent flock, the Official State Agency may, at its  discretion, require additional testing of the flock involved. If  infection is found in the parent flock, its classification shall be  suspended until the flock is requalified under the requirements for the  classification. Furthermore, the Official State Agency may require that  the hatching eggs from such flocks be removed from the incubator and  destroyed prior to hatching. When Salmonella organisms are isolated from  a specimen which originated in a participating hatchery, the Official  State Agency shall attempt to locate the source of the infection. The  results of the investigation and the action taken to eliminate the  infection shall be reported by the Official State Agency to the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and in accordance with part 147 of  this subchapter. HI titers of 1:40 or more may be interpreted as  suspicious, and final judgment must be based on further samplings and/or  culture of reactors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Procedures for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  test are set forth in the following publications:</p><p class="depth0">A.A.
