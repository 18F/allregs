                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before paying a retention incentive, an agency must require an  employee, including each employee covered by a group retention incentive  authorization and any employee who may receive a higher retention  incentive as a result of an approved waiver of the maximum limit on the  amount of a retention incentive under Sec. 575.309(e), to sign a  written service agreement to complete a specified period of employment  with the agency (or successor agency in the event of a transfer of  function). An authorized agency official must determine the length of a  service period. A written service agreement is not required under the  condition described in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The service agreement must include the commencement and  termination dates of the required service period. The service period  must begin on the first day of a pay period and end on the last day of a  pay period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>; and the timing of incentive  payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The service agreement must include the conditions under which  the agency must terminate the service agreement before the employee  completes the agreed-upon service period (i.e., if an employee is  demoted or separated for cause, receives a rating of record of less than  ``Fully Successful''   or equivalent, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service  agreement) under Sec. 575.311. The service agreement must specify the  effect of a termination, including the conditions under which the agency  will pay an additional retention incentive payment for partially  completed service under Sec. 575.311(e) and (f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The service agreement may include any other terms or conditions  that, if violated, will result in a termination of the service agreement  under Sec. 575.311(b). For example, the service agreement may specify  the employee's work schedule, type of position, and the duties he or she  is expected to perform. In addition, the service agreement may address  the extent to which periods of time on detail, in a nonpay status, or in  paid leave status are creditable towards the completion of the service  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A written service agreement is not required if the agency--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pays the retention incentive in biweekly installments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sets each biweekly installment payment at the full retention  incentive percentage rate established for the employee under Sec.  575.309(a).
