                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permit requirement. A taxidermist permit is required before any person may perform taxidermy services on migratory birds or their parts, nests, or eggs for any person other than himself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application procedures. Submit application for taxidermist permits to the appropriate Regional Director (Attention: Migratory bird permit office). You can find addresses for the Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Each application must contain the general information and certification required in Sec.  13.12(a) of this subchapter, and the following additional information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The address of premises where taxidermist services will be provided;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the applicant's qualifications and experience as a taxidermist; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State permit is required by State law, a statement as to whether or not the applicant possesses such State permit, giving its number and expiration date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permit authorizations. A permit authorizes a taxidermist to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Receive, transport, hold in custody or possession, mount or otherwise prepare, migratory birds, and their parts, nests, or eggs, and return them to another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sell properly marked, captive reared migratory waterfowl which he has lawfully acquired and mounted. Such mounted birds may be placed on consignment for sale and may be possessed by such consignee for the purpose of sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, taxidermist permits shall be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permittees must keep accurate records of operations, on a calendar year basis, showing the names and addresses of persons from and to whom migratory birds or their parts, nests, or eggs were received or delivered, the number and species of such, and the dates of receipt and delivery. In addition to the other records required by this paragraph, the permittee must maintain in his files, the original of the completed Form 3-186, Notice of Waterfowl Sale or Transfer, confirming

his acquisition of captive reared, properly marked migratory waterfowl from the holder of a current waterfowl sale and disposal permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the receipt, possession, and storage by a taxidermist of any migratory game birds taken by another by hunting is not authorized unless they are tagged as required by Sec.  20.36 of this subchapter. The required tags may be removed during the taxidermy operations but must be retained by the taxidermist with the other records required to be kept and must be reattached to the mounted specimen after mounting. The tag must then remain attached until the mounted specimen is delivered to the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Term of permit. A taxidermist permit issued or renewed under this part expires on the date designated on the face of the permit unless amended or revoked, but the term of the permit will not exceed five (5) years from the date of issuance or renewal.
