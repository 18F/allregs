                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the test procedures for supplemental testing conducted to determine compliance with the exhaust emission requirements of Sec. 94.8(e)(1). In general, the supplemental test procedures are the same as those otherwise specified by this subpart, except that they cover any speeds, loads, ambient conditions, and operating parameters that may be experienced in use. The test procedures specified by other sections in this subpart also apply to these tests, except as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding other provisions of this subpart, testing conducted to determine compliance with the exhaust emission requirements of Sec. 94.8(e) may be conducted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any speed and load (or any combination of speeds and loads that is nominally steady-state) within the applicable Not To Exceed Zone specified in paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Without correction, at any intake air temperature between 13 C and 35 C (or between 13 C and 30 C for engines not drawing intake air directly from a space that could be heated by the engine);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Without correction, at any intake air temperature between 13 C and 35 C (or between 13 C and 30 C for engines not drawing intake air directly from a space that could be heated by the engine);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Without correction at any ambient water temperature (or equivalent) between 5 C and 27 C;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Without correction at any ambient humidity between 7.1 and 10.7 grams of moisture per kilogram of dry air; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With a continuous sampling period not less than 30 seconds in duration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The specified Not to Exceed Zones for marine engines are defined as follows. These Not to Exceed Zones apply, unless a modified zone is established under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For commercial Category 1 engines certified using the duty cycle specified in Sec. 94.105(b), the Not to Exceed zones are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Not to Exceed zone is the region between the curves power = 1.15 x SPD\2\ and power = 0.85 x SPD\4\, excluding all operation below 25% of maximum power at rated speed and excluding all operation below 63% of maximum test speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This zone is divided into two subzones, one above and one below 45% of maximum power at rated speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> SPD in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section refers to percent of maximum test speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> See Figure B-1 for an illustration of this Not to Exceed zone which follows:
