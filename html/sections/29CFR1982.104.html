                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of a complaint in the investigating office, the Assistant Secretary will notify the respondent of the filing of the complaint by providing a

copy of the complaint, redacted, if necessary, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, et seq., and other applicable confidentiality laws, and will also notify the respondent of its rights under paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1982.110. The Assistant Secretary will provide a copy of the unredacted complaint to the complainant (or to the complainant's legal counsel, if complainant is represented by counsel), and to the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, or the Transportation Security Administration as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 20 days of receipt of the notice of the filing of the complaint provided under paragraph (a) of this section, the respondent may submit to the Assistant Secretary a written statement and any affidavits or documents substantiating its position. Within the same 20 days, the respondent may request a meeting with the Assistant Secretary to present its position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Throughout the investigation, the agency will provide to the complainant (or the complainant's legal counsel if complainant is represented by counsel) a copy of all of respondent's submissions to the agency that are responsive to the complainant's whistleblower complaint. Before providing such materials to the complainant, the agency will redact them, if necessary, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, et seq., and other applicable confidentiality laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Investigations will be conducted in a manner that protects the confidentiality of any person who provides information on a confidential basis, other than the complainant, in accordance with part 70 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> A complaint of alleged violation will be dismissed unless the complainant has made a prima facie showing that protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse action alleged in the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A complaint of alleged violation will be dismissed unless the complainant has made a prima facie showing that protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse action alleged in the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The complaint, supplemented as appropriate by interviews of the complainant, must allege the existence of facts and evidence to make a prima facie showing as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employee engaged in a protected activity (or, in circumstances covered by the statutes, was perceived to have engaged or to be about to engage in protected activity);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The respondent knew or suspected, actually or constructively, that the employee engaged in the protected activity (or, in circumstances covered by the statutes, perceived the employee to have engaged or to be about to engage in protected activity);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee suffered an adverse action; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The circumstances were sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity (or perception thereof) was a contributing factor in the adverse action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of determining whether to investigate, the complainant will be considered to have met the required burden if the complaint on its face, supplemented as appropriate through interviews of the complainant, alleges the existence of facts and either direct or circumstantial evidence to meet the required showing, i.e., to give rise to an inference that the respondent knew or suspected that the employee engaged in protected activity (or, in circumstances covered by the statutes, perceived the employee to have engaged or to be about to engage in protected activity), and that the protected activity (or perception thereof) was a contributing factor in the adverse action. The burden may be satisfied, for example, if the complaint shows that the adverse action took place shortly after the protected activity, giving rise to the inference that it was a contributing factor in the adverse action. If the required showing has not been made, the complainant (or the complainant's legal counsel if complainant is represented by counsel) will be so notified and the investigation will not commence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding a finding that a complainant has made a prima facie showing, as required by this section, an investigation of the complaint will not be conducted or will be discontinued if the respondent, pursuant to the procedures provided in this paragraph, demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the

same adverse action in the absence of the complainant's protected activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the respondent fails to make a timely response or fails to satisfy the burden set for in the prior paragraph, the Assistant Secretary will proceed with the investigation. The investigation will proceed whenever it is necessary or appropriate to confirm or verify the information provided by the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prior to the issuance of findings and a preliminary order as provided for in Sec. 1982.105, if the Assistant Secretary has reasonable cause, on the basis of information gathered under the procedures of this part, to believe that the respondent has violated NTSSA or FRSA and that preliminary reinstatement is warranted, the Assistant Secretary will again contact the respondent (or the respondent's legal counsel if respondent is represented by counsel) to give notice of the substance of the relevant evidence supporting the complainant's allegations as developed during the course of the investigation. This evidence includes any witness statements, which will be redacted to protect the identity of confidential informants where statements were given in confidence; if the statements cannot be redacted without revealing the identity of confidential informants, summaries of their contents will be provided. The respondent will be given the opportunity to submit a written response, to meet with the investigators, to present statements from witnesses in support of its position, and to present legal and factual arguments. The respondent will present this evidence within 10 business days of the Assistant Secretary's notification pursuant to this paragraph, or as soon thereafter as the Assistant Secretary and the respondent can agree, if the interests of justice so require.</p>
