Section 111(e) requires that such entity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was in existence on December 31, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Was established under section 122 (relating to State Job Training Coordinating Councils) or title VII (relating to State Human Resource Investment Councils) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C.1501 et seq.), as in effect on December 31, 1997, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Was established under section 122 (relating to State Job Training Coordinating Councils) or title VII (relating to State Human Resource Investment Councils) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C.1501 et seq.), as in effect on December 31, 1997, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is substantially similar to the State Board described in WIA section 111(a), (b), and (c) and Sec. 661.200; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Includes, at a minimum, two or more representatives of business in the State and two or more representatives of labor organizations in the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the alternative entity does not provide for representative membership of each of the categories of required State Board membership under WIA section 111(b), the State Plan must explain the manner in which the State will ensure an ongoing role for any unrepresented membership group in the workforce investment system. The State Board may maintain an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the State Plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the membership structure of the alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the State Board. In such case, the Governor must establish a new State Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 111(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-

voting members are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the State Board also apply to an alternative entity used by a State.</p>
