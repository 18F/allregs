                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior approval requirement. An employee, other than a special Government employee, who is required to file either a public or confidential financial disclosure report (SF 278 or OGE Form 450), or an alternative form of reporting approved by the Office of Government Ethics, shall, before engaging in outside employment, obtain written approval in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of employment. For purposes of this section, ``employment'' means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee for direct, indirect, or deferred compensation other than reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses. It also includes, irrespective of compensation, the following outside activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Providing personal services as a consultant or professional, including service as an expert witness or as an attorney; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Providing personal services to a for-profit entity as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee, which involves decision making or policymaking for the non-Federal entity, or the provision of advice or counsel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Submission of requests for approval. An employee seeking to engage in employment for which advance approval is required shall submit a written request for approval to the employee's supervisor a reasonable time before the employee proposes to begin the employment. Upon a significant change in the nature of the outside employment or in the employee's official position, the employee shall submit a revised request for approval. The supervisor will forward written requests for approval to the agency designee, through normal supervisory channels. All requests for prior approval shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The employee's name, organizational location, occupational title, grade, and salary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The nature of the proposed outside employment, including a full description of the specific duties or services to be performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of the employee's official duties that relate in any way to the proposed employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the person or organization for whom or with which the employee is to be employed, including the location where the services will be performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The method or basis of any compensation (e.g., fee, per diem, honorarium, royalties, stock options, travel and expenses, or other);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A statement as to whether the compensation is derived from a USDA grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other source of USDA funding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For employment involving the provision of consultative or professional services, a statement indicating whether the client, employer, or other person on whose behalf the services are performed is receiving, or intends to seek, a USDA grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other funding relationship; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For employment involving teaching, speaking, writing or editing, the proposed text of any disclaimer required by 5 CFR 2635.807(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Standard for approval. Approval shall be granted by the agency designee unless it is determined that the outside employment is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Responsibilities of the component agencies. (1) The agency designee for each separate agency or component of USDA may issue an instruction or manual issuance exempting categories of employment from a requirement of prior written approval based on a determination that employment within those categories would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by Federal statutes or regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Department components may specify internal procedures governing the submission of prior approval requests, including but not limited to: timely submission requirements; determination deadlines; appeals or reviews; and requirements for updating requests. Internal procedures also should designate appropriate officials to act on such requests. The instructions or manual issuances may include examples of outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with 5 CFR part 2635 and this part. With respect to employment involving teaching, speaking or writing, the instructions or manual issuances may specify pre-clearance procedures and/or require disclaimers indicating that the views expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the agency, USDA or the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The officials within the respective USDA agencies or components responsible for the administrative aspects of these regulations and the maintenance of records shall make provisions for the filing and retention of requests for approval of outside employment and copies of the notification of approval or disapproval.</p>
