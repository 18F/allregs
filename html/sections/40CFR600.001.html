                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this part apply to 2008 and later model year  automobiles that are not medium duty passenger vehicles, and to 2011 and  later model year automobiles including medium-duty passenger vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of subparts A, D, and F of this part are optional  through the 2011 model year in the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers that produce only electric vehicles are exempt  from the requirements of this subpart, except with regard to the  requirements in those sections pertaining specifically to electric  vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers with worldwide production (excluding electric  vehicle production) of less than 10,000 gasoline-fueled and/or diesel  powered passenger automobiles and light trucks may optionally comply  with the electric vehicle requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless stated otherwise, references to fuel economy or fuel  economy data in this part shall also be interpreted to mean the related  exhaust emissions of CO2, HC, and CO, and where applicable  for alternative fuel vehicles, CH3OH,  C2H5OH, C2H4O, HCHO, NMHC  and CH4. References to average fuel economy shall be  interpreted to also mean average carbon-related exhaust emissions and  average CO2 emissions. References to fuel economy data  vehicles shall also be meant to refer to vehicles tested for carbon- related exhaust emissions for the purpose of demonstrating compliance  with fleet average CO2 standards in Sec. 86.1818 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The model year of initial applicability for sections in this  part is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the  hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is applicable.  An individual section continues to apply for later model years until it  is replaced by a different section that applies starting in a later  model year. Sections that have no two-digit suffix apply for all 2008  and later model year vehicles, except as noted in those sections. If a  section has a two-digit suffix but the regulation references that  section without including the two-digit suffix, this refers to the  section applicable for the appropriate model year. This also applies for  references to part 86 of this chapter. As an example, Sec. 600.113-08  applies to the 2008 and subsequent model years until Sec. 600.113-12 is  applicable beginning with the 2012 model year. Section 600.111-08 would  then apply only for 2008 through 2011 model year vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You. The term ``you'' in this part refers to manufacturers  subject to the requirements of this part.  [76 FR 39524, July 6, 2011, as amended at 79 FR 23746, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
