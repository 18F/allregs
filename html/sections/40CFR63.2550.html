All condensers recovering condensate from an MCPU at or above the boiling point or all condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers. Typically, a primary condenser or condensers in series are considered to be integral to the MCPU if they are capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. This definition does not apply to a condenser that is used to remove materials that would hinder performance of a downstream recovery device as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To remove water vapor that would cause icing in a downstream condenser, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To remove water vapor that would negatively affect the adsorption capacity of carbon in a downstream carbon adsorber, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To remove high molecular weight organic compounds or other organic compounds that would be difficult to remove during regeneration of a downstream carbon adsorber.</p><p class="depth0">Process tank means a tank or vessel that is used within a process to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage tank or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process or a product storage tank.

Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery device for a wastewater stream, a decanter and any other equipment based on the operating principle of gravity separation must receive only multi-phase liquid streams.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth0">Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature

fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the cessation of operation of a continuous operation for any purpose. Shutdown also means the cessation of a batch operation, or any related individual piece of equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, if the steps taken to cease operation differ from those described in a standard batch or nonstandard batch. Shutdown also applies to emptying and degassing storage vessels. Shutdown does not apply to cessation of batch operations at the end of a campaign or between batches within a campaign when the steps taken are routine operations.</p><p class="depth0">Small control device means a control device that controls total HAP emissions of less than 10 tpy, before control.</p><p class="depth0">Standard batch means a batch process operated within a range of operating conditions that are documented in an operating scenario. Emissions from a standard batch are based on the operating conditions that result in highest emissions. The standard batch defines the uncontrolled and controlled emissions for each emission episode defined under the operating scenario.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the setting in operation of a continuous operation for any purpose; the first time a new or reconstructed batch operation begins production; for new equipment added, including equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put into operation; or for the introduction of a new product/process, the first time the product or process is run in equipment. For batch operations, startup applies to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past if the steps taken to begin production differ from those specified in a standard batch or nonstandard batch. Startup does not apply when the equipment is put into operation as part of a batch within a campaign when the steps taken are routine operations.</p><p class="depth0">Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store liquids that contain organic HAP and/or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP and that has been assigned to an MCPU according to the procedures in Sec. 63.2435(d).

Air that is part of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is not considered supplemental gases. Air required to operate combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental gases.</p><p class="depth0">Surge control vessel means feed drums, recycle drums, and intermediate vessels as part of any continuous operation. Surge control vessels are used within an MCPU when in-process storage, mixing, or management of flowrates or volumes is needed to introduce material into continuous operations.</p><p class="depth0">Total organic compounds or (TOC) means the total gaseous organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) in a vent stream.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer rack means the collection of loading arms and loading hoses, at a single loading rack, that are assigned to an MCPU according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.2435(d) and are used to fill tank trucks and/or rail cars with organic liquids that contain one or more of the organic HAP listed in

section 112(b) of the CAA of this subpart. Transfer rack includes the associated pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and valves.</p><p class="depth0">Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and recycle materials.
