                                Sec. 1.832-1  Gross income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gross income as defined in section 832(b)(1) means the gross  amount of income earned during the taxable year from interest,  dividends, rents, and premium income, computed on the basis of the  underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by  the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners, as well as the gain  derived from the sale or other disposition of property, and all other  items constituting gross income under section 61, except that in the  case of a mutual fire insurance company described in Sec. 1.831-1 the  amount of single   deposit premiums received, but not assessments, shall be excluded from  gross income. Gross income does not include increase in liabilities  during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, remittances from the  home office of a foreign insurance company to the United States branch,  borrowed money, or gross increase due to adjustments in book value of  capital assets. The underwriting and investment exhibit is presumed to  reflect the true net income of the company, and insofar as it is not  inconsistent with the provisions of the Code will be recognized and used  as a basis for that purpose. All items of the exhibit, however, do not  reflect an insurance company's income as defined in the Code. By reason  of the definition of investment income, miscellaneous items which are  intended to reflect surplus but do not properly enter into the  computation of income, such as dividends declared to shareholders in  their capacity as such, home office remittances and receipts, and  special deposits, are ignored. Gain or loss from agency balances and  bills receivable not admitted as assets on the underwriting and  investment exhibit will be ignored, excepting only such agency balances  and bills receivable as have been allowed as deductions for worthless  debts or, having been previously so allowed, are recovered during the  taxable year. In computing ``premiums earned on insurance contracts  during the taxable year'' the amount of the unearned premiums shall  include (1) life insurance reserves as defined in section 803(b) and  Sec. 1.803-1 pertaining to the life, burial, or funeral insurance, or  annuity business of an insurance company subject to the tax imposed by  section 831 and not qualifying as a life insurance company under section  801, and (2) liability for return premiums under a rate credit or  retrospective rating plan based on experience, such as the ``War  Department Insurance Rating Plan,'' and which return premiums are  therefore not earned premiums. In computing ``losses incurred'' the  determination of unpaid losses at the close of each year must represent  actual unpaid losses as nearly as it is possible to ascertain them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every insurance company to which this section applies must be  prepared to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that  the part of the deduction for ``losses incurred'' which represents  unpaid losses at the close of the taxable year comprises only actual  unpaid losses stated in amounts which, based upon the facts in each case  and the company's experience with similar cases, can be said to  represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the amount the company will  be required to pay. Amounts included in, or added to, the estimates of  such losses which, in the opinion of the district director are in excess  of the actual liability determined as provided in the preceding sentence  will be disallowed as a deduction. The district director may require any  such insurance company to submit such detailed information with respect  to its actual experience as is deemed necessary to establish the  reasonableness of the deduction for ``losses incurred.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> That part of the deduction for ``losses incurred'' which  represents an adjustment to losses paid for salvage and reinsurance  recoverable shall, except as hereinafter provided, include all salvage  in course of liquidation, and all reinsurance in process of collection  not otherwise taken into account as a reduction of losses paid,  outstanding at the end of the taxable year. Salvage in course of  liquidation includes all property (other than cash), real or personal,  tangible or intangible, except that which may not be included by reason  of express statutory provisions (or rules and regulations of an  insurance department) of any State or Territory or the District of  Columbia in which the company transacts business. Such salvage in course  of liquidation shall be taken into account to the extent of the value  thereof at the end of the taxable year as determined from a fair and  reasonable estimate based upon either the facts in each case or the  company's experience with similar cases. Cash received during the  taxable year with respect to items of salvage or reinsurance shall be  taken into account in computing losses paid during such taxable year.</p>
