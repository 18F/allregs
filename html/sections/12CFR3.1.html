                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part establishes minimum capital requirements and  overall capital adequacy standards for national banks or Federal savings  associations. This part includes methodologies for calculating minimum  capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the  capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation of authority. Nothing in this part shall be read to  limit the authority of the OCC to take action under other provisions of  law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or  conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or  regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d) and  (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy  standards. Each national bank or Federal savings association must  calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital  adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory capital. Each national bank or Federal savings  association must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with  subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-weighted assets. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each national bank or Federal savings  association must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and  subpart F of this part for a market risk national bank or Federal  savings association) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted  assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings  association must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of  this part for a market risk national bank or Federal savings  association) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted  assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disclosures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except for an advanced approaches national bank  or Federal savings association that is making public disclosures  pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each national  bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of  $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in  subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each market risk national bank or Federal savings association  must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings  association must make the public disclosures described in subpart E of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reservation of authority. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Additional capital in the  aggregate. The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings  association to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than  otherwise required under this part if the OCC determines that the  national bank's or Federal savings association's   capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the  national bank's or Federal savings association's credit, market,  operational, or other risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory capital elements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the OCC determines that a  particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital  element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb  losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the OCC may  require the national bank or Federal savings association to exclude all  or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital,  additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments  set forth in subpart C of this part, the OCC may find that a capital  element may be included in a national bank's or Federal savings  association's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital,  or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the  loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with  Sec. 3.20(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk-weighted asset amounts. If the OCC determines that the  risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the national  bank or Federal savings association for one or more exposures is not  commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the OCC may  require the national bank or Federal savings association to assign a  different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the  amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Total leverage. If the OCC determines that the total leverage  exposure, or the amount reflected in the national bank's or Federal  savings association's reported average total consolidated assets, for an  on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by a national bank or  Federal savings association under Sec. 3.10 is inappropriate for the  exposure(s) or the circumstances of the national bank or Federal savings  association, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings  association to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the  denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consolidation of certain exposures. The OCC may determine that  the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment  provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the national bank's or  Federal savings association's balance sheet is not commensurate with the  risk of the exposure and the relationship of the national bank or  Federal savings association to the entity. Upon making this  determination, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings  association to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated  on the balance sheet of the national bank or Federal savings association  for purposes of determining the national bank's or Federal savings  association's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the  national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital  ratios accordingly. The OCC will look to the substance of, and risk  associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the  OCC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other reservation of authority. With respect to any deduction or  limitation required under this part, the OCC may require a different  deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or  limitation is commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings  association's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice and response procedures. In making a determination under  this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures in the  same manner as the notice and response procedures in Sec. 3.404.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Timing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of  this part, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings  association that is not a savings and loan holding company must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section,  beginning on January 1, 2014, calculate advanced approaches total risk- weighted assets in accordance with subpart E and, if applicable, subpart  F of this part and, beginning on January 1, 2015, calculate standardized  total risk-weighted assets   in accordance with subpart D and, if applicable, subpart F of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate risk-weighted assets in accordance with the general  risk-based capital rules under appendix A to this part and, if  applicable, subpart F of this part (national banks), or 12 CFR part 167  and, if applicable, subpart F of this part (Federal savings  associations) \1\ and substitute such risk-weighted assets for  standardized total risk-weighted assets for purposes of Sec. 3.10;
