                                Sec. 800.9  Council review of section 106 compliance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assessment of agency official compliance for individual  undertakings. The Council may provide to the agency official its  advisory opinion regarding the substance of any finding, determination  or decision or regarding the adequacy of the agency official's  compliance with the procedures under this part. The Council may provide  such advice at any time at the request of any individual, agency or  organization or on its own initiative. The agency official shall  consider the views of the Council in reaching a decision on the matter  in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency foreclosure of the Council's opportunity to comment.  Where an agency official has failed to complete the requirements of  section 106 in accordance with the procedures in this part prior to the  approval of an undertaking, the Council's opportunity to comment may be  foreclosed. The Council may review a case to determine whether a  foreclosure has occurred. The Council shall notify the agency official  and the agency's Federal preservation officer and allow 30 days for the  agency official to provide information as to whether foreclosure has  occurred. If the Council determines foreclosure has occurred, the  Council shall transmit the determination to the agency official and the  head of the agency. The Council shall also make the determination  available to the public and any parties known to be interested in the  undertaking and its effects upon historic properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Intentional adverse effects by applicants--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agency  responsibility. Section 110(k) of the act prohibits a Federal agency  from granting a loan, loan guarantee, permit, license or other  assistance to an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of  section 106, has intentionally significantly adversely affected a  historic property to which the grant would relate, or having legal power  to prevent it, has allowed such significant adverse effect to occur,  unless the agency, after consultation with the Council, determines that  circumstances justify granting such assistance despite the adverse  effect created or permitted by the applicant. Guidance issued by the  Secretary pursuant to section 110 of the act governs its implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consultation with the Council. When an agency official  determines, based on the actions of an applicant, that section 110(k) is  applicable and that circumstances may justify granting the assistance,  the agency official shall notify the Council and provide documentation  specifying the circumstances under which the adverse effects to the  historic property occurred and the degree of damage to the integrity of  the property. This documentation shall include any views obtained from  the applicant, SHPO/THPO, an Indian tribe if the undertaking occurs on  or affects historic properties on tribal lands, and other parties known  to be interested in the undertaking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within thirty days of receiving the agency official's  notification, unless otherwise agreed to by the agency official, the  Council shall provide the agency official with its opinion as to whether  circumstances justify granting assistance to the applicant and any  possible mitigation of the adverse effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agency official shall consider the Council's opinion in  making a decision on whether to grant assistance to the applicant, and  shall notify the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and other parties known to be  interested in the undertaking prior to granting the assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with Section 106. If an agency official, after  consulting with the Council, determines to grant the assistance, the  agency official shall comply with Sec. Sec. 800.3 through 800.6 to take  into account the effects of the undertaking on any historic properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation of Section 106 operations. The Council may evaluate  the operation of the section 106 process by periodic reviews of how  participants have fulfilled their legal responsibilities and how  effectively the outcomes reached advance the purposes of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information from participants. Section 203 of the act authorizes  the Council to obtain information from Federal agencies necessary to  conduct evaluation of the section 106 process. The agency official shall  make documentation of agency policies, operating procedures and actions  taken to comply with section 106 available to the Council upon request.  The Council may request available information and documentation from  other participants in the section 106 process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Improving the operation of section 106. Based upon any  evaluation of the section 106 process, the Council may make  recommendations to participants, the heads of Federal agencies, and the  Secretary of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the  process. Where the Council determines that an agency official or a SHPO/ THPO has failed to properly carry out the responsibilities assigned  under the process in this part, the Council may participate in  individual case reviews conducted under such process in addition to the  SHPO/THPO for such period that it determines is necessary to improve  performance or correct deficiencies. If the Council finds a pattern of  failure by a Federal agency in carrying out its responsibilities under  section 106, the Council may review the policies and programs of the  agency related to historic preservation pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of  the act and recommend methods to improve the effectiveness,  coordination, and consistency of those policies and programs with  section 106.</p>
