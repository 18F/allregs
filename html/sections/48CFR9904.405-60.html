                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An auditor recommends disallowance of certain direct labor and  direct materials costs, for which a billing has been submitted under a  contract, on the basis that these particular costs were not required for  performance and were not authorized by the contract. The contracting  officer issues a written decision which supports the auditor's position  that the questioned costs are unallowable. Following receipt of the   contracting officer's decision, the contractor must clearly identify the  disallowed direct labor and direct material costs in his accounting  records and reports covering any subsequent submission which includes  such costs. Also, if the contractor's base for allocation of any  indirect cost pool relevant to the subject contract consists of direct  labor, direct material, total prime cost, total cost input, etc., he  must include the disallowed direct labor and material costs in his  allocation base for such pool. Had the contracting officer's decision  been against the auditor, the contractor would not, of course, have been  required to account separately for the costs questioned by the auditor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A contractor incurs, and separately identifies, as a part of his  manufacturing overhead, certain costs which are expressly unallowable  under the existing and currently effective regulations. If manufacturing  overhead is regularly a part of the contractor's base for allocation of  general and administrative (G&A;) or other indirect expenses, the  contractor must allocate the G&A; or other indirect expenses to contracts  and other final cost objectives by means of a base which includes the  identified unallowable manufacturing overhead costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An auditor recommends disallowance of the total direct indirect  costs attributable to an organizational planning activity. The  contractor claims that the total of these activity costs are allowable  under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as ``Economic planning  costs'' (48 CFR 31.205-12); the auditor contends that they constitute  ``Organization costs'' (48 CFR 31.205-27) and therefore are unallowable.  The issue is referred to the contracting officer for resolution pursuant  to the contract disputes clause. The contracting officer issues a  written decision supporting the auditor's position that the total costs  questioned are unallowable under the FAR. Following receipt of the  contracting officer's decision, the contractor must identify the  disallowed costs and specific other costs incurred for the same purpose  in like circumstances in any subsequent estimating, cost accumulation or  reporting for Government contracts, in which such costs are included. If  the contracting officer's decision had supported the contractor's  contention, the costs questioned by the auditor would have been  allowable ``Economic planning costs,'' and the contractor would not have  been required to provide special identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A defense contractor was engaged in a program of expansion and  diversification of corporate activities. This involved internal  corporate reorganization, as well as mergers and acquisitions. All costs  of this activity were charged by the contractor as corporate or segment  general and administrative (G&A;) expense. In the contractor's proposals  for final Segment G&A; rates (including corporate home office  allocations) to be applied in determining allowable costs of its defense  contracts subject to 48 CFR part 31, the contractor identified and  excluded the expressly unallowable costs (as listed in 48 CFR 31.205-12)  incurred for incorporation fees and for charges for special services of  outside attorneys, accountants, promoters, and consultants. In addition,  during the course of negotiation of interim bidding and billing G&A;  rates, the contractor agreed to classify as unallowable various in-house  costs incurred for the expansion program, and various directly  associated costs of the identifiable unallowable costs. On the basis of  negotiations and agreements between the contractor and the contracting  officers' authorized representatives, interim G&A; rates were  established, based on the net balance of allowable G&A; costs.  Application of the rates negotiated to proposals, and on an interim  basis to billings, for covered contracts constitutes compliance with the  Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An official of a company, whose salary, travel, and subsistence  expenses are charged regularly as general and administrative (G&A;)  expenses, takes several business associates on what is clearly a  business entertainment trip. The entertainment costs of such trips is  expressly unallowable because it constitutes entertainment expense, and  is separately identified by the contractor. The contractor does not  regularly include his G&A; expenses in any indirect-expense allocation  base. In these circumstances, the official's   travel and subsistence expenses would be directly associated costs for  identification with the unallowable entertainment expense. However,  unless this type of activity constituted a significant part of the  official's regular duties and responsibilities on which his salary was  based, no part of the official's salary would be required to be  identified as a directly associated cost of the unallowable  entertainment expense.
