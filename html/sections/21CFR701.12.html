Abbreviations for ``Company,'' ``Incorporated,'' etc., may be used and ``The'' may be omitted. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the cosmetic is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such cosmetic; such as, ``Manufactured for --------------'', ``Distributed by ----------------'', or any other wording that expresses the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory.
