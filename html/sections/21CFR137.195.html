                            <p class="depth0">Crushed wheat, coarse ground wheat, is the food prepared by so crushing cleaned wheat other than durum wheat and red durum wheat that, when tested by the method prescribed in Sec. 137.200(c)(2), 40 percent or more passes through a No. 8 sieve and less than 50 percent passes through a No. 20 sieve. The proportions of the natural constituents of such wheat, other than moisture, remain unaltered. Crushed wheat contains not more than 15 percent of moisture as determined by the method prescribed in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), section 7.002 under ``Preparation of Sample--Official Final Action,'' and section 7.003 under ``Moisture--Official Final Action. I. Drying in Vacuo at 95-100 (2),'' which is incorporated by reference.
