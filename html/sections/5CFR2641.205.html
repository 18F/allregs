                                Sec. 2641.205  Two-year restriction on any former very senior employee's 
matter, regardless of prior involvement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 207(d). For two years after his service in a very senior employee position terminates, no former very senior employee shall knowingly, with the intent to influence, make any communication to or appearance before any official appointed to an Executive Schedule position listed in 5 U.S.C. 5312-5316 or before any employee of an agency in which he served as a very senior employee within the one-year period prior to his termination from a very senior employee position, if that communication or appearance is made on behalf of any other person in connection with any matter on which the former very senior employee seeks official action by any official or employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions and waivers. The prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 207(d) does not apply to a former very senior employee who is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acting on behalf of the United States. See Sec. 2641.301(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acting as an elected State or local government official. See Sec. 2641.301(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acting on behalf of specified entities. See Sec. 2641.301(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Making uncompensated statements based on special knowledge. See Sec. 2641.301(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Communicating scientific or technological information pursuant to procedures or certification. See Sec. 2641.301(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Testifying under oath. See Sec. 2641.301(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Acting on behalf of a candidate or political party. See Sec. 2641.301(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Acting on behalf of an international organization pursuant to a waiver. See Sec. 2641.301(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Acting as an employee of a Government-owned, contractor-operated entity pursuant to a waiver. See Sec. 2641.301(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commencement and length of restriction. 18 U.S.C. 207(d) is a two-year restriction. The two-year period is measured from the date when the employee ceases to serve in a very senior employee position, not from the termination of Government service, unless the two events occur simultaneously. See examples 1 and 2 to paragraph (d) of Sec. 2641.204.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Communication or appearance. SeeSec. 2641.201(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With the intent to influence. SeeSec. 2641.201(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To or before employee of former agency. See Sec. 2641.204(g), except that this section covers only former very senior employees and applies only with respect to the agency or agencies in which a former very senior employee

served as a very senior employee, and very senior employees do not benefit from the designation of distinct and separate agency components as referenced in Sec. 2641.204(g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To or before an official appointed to an Executive Schedule position. See Sec. 2641.204(g)(3) for ``to or before,'' except that this section covers only former very senior employees and also extends to a communication or appearance before any official currently appointed to a position that is listed in sections 5 U.S.C. 5312-5316.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (g): A communication made to an official described in 5 U.S.C. 5312-5316 can include a communication to a subordinate of such official with the intent that the information be conveyed directly to the official and attributed to the former very senior employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> On behalf of any other person. See Sec. 2641.201(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Matter on which former very senior employee seeks official action. See Sec. 2641.204(i), except that this section only covers former very senior employees.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 to Sec. 2641.205: The former Attorney General may not contact the Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division on behalf of a professional sports league in support of a proposed exemption from certain laws, nor may he contact the Secretary of Labor. He may, however, speak directly to the President or Vice President concerning the issue.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2 to Sec. 2641.205: The former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is now the Chief Executive Officer of a major computer firm and wishes to convince the new Administration to change its new policy concerning computer chips. The former OMB Director may contact an employee of the Department of Commerce who, although paid at a level fixed according to level III of the Executive Schedule, does not occupy a position actually listed in 5 U.S.C. 5312-5316. She could not contact an employee working in the Office of the United States Trade Representative, an office within the Executive Office of the President (her former agency).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3 to Sec. 2641.205: A senior employee serves in the Department of Agriculture for several years. He is then appointed to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) but resigns seven months later. Since the individual served as a very senior employee only at HHS, he is barred for two years by 18 U.S.C. 207(d) as to any employee of HHS and any official currently appointed to an Executive Schedule position listed in 5 U.S.C. 5312-5316, including any such official serving in the Department of Agriculture. (In addition, a one-year section 207(c) bar commenced when he terminated service as a senior employee at the Department of Agriculture.)</p><p class="depth2">Example 4 to Sec. 2641.205: The former Secretary of the Department of Labor may not represent another person in a meeting with the current Secretary of Transportation to discuss a proposed regulation on highway safety standards.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5 to Sec. 2641.205: In the previous example, the former very senior employee would like to meet instead with the special assistant to the Secretary of Transportation. The former employee knows that the special assistant has a close working relationship with the Secretary. The former employee expects that the special assistant would brief the Secretary about any discussions at the proposed meeting and refer specifically to the former employee. Because the circumstances indicate that the former employee intends that the information provided at the meeting would be conveyed by the assistant directly to the Secretary and attributed to the former employee, he may not meet with the assistant.</p>
