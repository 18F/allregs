Each miner who files a claim  for benefits under the Act must be provided an opportunity to  substantiate his or her claim by means of a complete pulmonary  evaluation including, but not limited to, a chest radiograph (X-ray),  physical examination, pulmonary function tests, and a blood-gas study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, 725.414(a),  725.456(d)). These standards shall also apply to claims governed by part  727 (see 20 CFR 725.4(d)), but only for clinical tests or examinations  conducted after January 19, 2001. Any clinical test or examination  subject to these standards shall be in substantial compliance with the  applicable standard in order to constitute evidence of the fact for  which it is proffered. Unless otherwise provided, any evidence which is  not in substantial   compliance with the applicable standard is insufficient to establish the  fact for which it is proffered.
