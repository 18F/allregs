                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the  release of official documents and information, including the requirement  that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a  confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure.  The terms of the protective order or of the confidentiality agreement  must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective  orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, MCC may  condition the release of official documents and information on an  amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the General Counsel so determines, original MCC documents may  be presented in response to a demand, but they are not to be presented  as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their  identity as official MCC documents nor are they to be marked or altered.  In lieu of original records, certified copies will be presented for  evidentiary purposes. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733).</p>
