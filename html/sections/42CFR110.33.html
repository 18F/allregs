                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible survivors may be able to receive a death benefit under  this Program if the Secretary determines that an otherwise eligible  countermeasure recipient sustained a covered injury and died as a direct  result of the injury or its health complications. The method and amount  of death benefits are described in Sec.  110.82. As provided in Sec.   110.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover death benefits paid  by the Program if third-party payers are obligated to provide those  benefits. There are two different calculations for death benefits: the  standard calculation and the alternative calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, is based  upon the death benefit available under the PSOB Program and is available  to all eligible survivors with one exception (surviving dependents  younger than the age of 18 who do not fit the definition of ``child''  under Sec.  110.3(e)). In the event that death benefits were paid under  the PSOB Program with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure  recipient, no death benefits may be paid under the standard calculation.  In addition, death benefits under this standard calculation are  secondary to disability benefits under the PSOB Program. If a disability  benefit was paid under the PSOB Program, the amount of that disability  benefit would be deducted from benefits payable under the standard  calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, is  based on the injured countermeasure recipient's employment income at the  time of the covered injury. Payment under this calculation is only  available to surviving dependents who are younger than the age of 18 at  the time of payment. The legal guardian(s) of such surviving dependents  must select the death benefit as calculated under this alternative  calculation before it will be paid. Annual and lifetime caps may apply.  The payment of a death benefit as calculated under this alternative  calculation is secondary to other benefits paid or payable with respect  to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient, namely:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for loss of employment income (except for lost  employment income under this Program);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Death or disability benefits (i.e., payments including, but not  limited to, those under the PSOB Program) on behalf of the dependent(s)  or their legal guardian(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retirement benefits on behalf of the dependent(s) or their legal  guardians; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Life insurance benefits on behalf of the dependent(s).</p>
