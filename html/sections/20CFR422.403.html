For purposes of this paragraph, an overpayment will be deemed  to be unrecoverable from any individual who was living in a separate  household from yours at the time of the overpayment and who did not  receive the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overpayments under title XVI of the Social Security Act. This  subpart applies to overpayments under title XVI of the Social Security  Act if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are not receiving benefits under title XVI of the Social  Security Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We are not collecting your title XVI overpayment by reducing  title II benefits payable to you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We have completed our billing system sequence (i.e., we have  sent you an initial notice of the overpayment, a reminder notice, and a  past-due notice) or we have suspended or terminated collection activity  under applicable rules, such as, the Federal Claims Collection Standards  in 31 CFR 903.2 or 31 CFR 903.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We have not made an installment payment arrangement with you or,  if we have made such an arrangement, you have failed to make any payment  for two consecutive months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You have not requested waiver pursuant to Sec. 416.550 or  Sec. 416.582 of this chapter or, after a review conducted pursuant to  those sections, we have determined that we will not waive collection of  the overpayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You have not requested reconsideration of the initial  overpayment determination pursuant to Secs. 416.1407 and 416.1409 of  this chapter or, after a review conducted pursuant to Sec. 416.1413 of  this chapter, we have affirmed all or part of the initial overpayment  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> We cannot recover your overpayment pursuant to Sec. 416.570 of  this chapter by adjustment of benefits payable to any individual other  than you.
