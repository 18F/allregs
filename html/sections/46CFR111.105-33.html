As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Enclosed spaces'' are locations delineated by floors,  bulkheads, or decks which may have doors or windows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Semi-enclosed spaces'' are locations where natural conditions  of ventilation are notably different from those on open deck due to the  presence of structures such as roofs, windbreaks, and bulkheads which  are so arranged that dispersion of gas may not occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The internal space of each pressure vessel, tank, and pipe for  drilling mud and for gas venting must have only intrinsically safe  electric equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following are Class I, Division 1 locations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enclosed space that contains any part of the mud circulating  system that has an opening into the space and is between the well and  final degassing discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enclosed or semi-enclosed location that is below the drill  floor and contains a possible source of gas release such as the top of a  drilling nipple.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An enclosed space that is on the drill floor and is not  separated by a solid, gas-tight floor from the spaces specified in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A space that would normally be considered a Division 2 location  under paragraph (e) of this section but where combustible or flammable  gases might accumulate. This could include pits, ducts, and similar  structures downstream of the final degassing discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A location in the weather or a semi-enclosed location, except as  provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that is within 5 feet (1.5  m) of the boundary of any:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Equipment or opening specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ventilation outlet, access, or other opening to a Class I,  Division 1 space; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Gas vent outlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an enclosed  space that has an opening into a Class I, Division 1 location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following are Class I, Division 2 locations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enclosed space that has any open portion of the mud  circulating system from the final degassing discharge to the mud suction  connection at the mud pit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A location in the weather that is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within the boundaries of the drilling derrick up to a height of  10 feet (3m) above the drill floor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Below the drill floor and within a radius of 10 feet (3m) of a  possible source of release, such as the top of a drilling nipple; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within 5 feet (1.5m) of the boundaries of any ventilation  outlet, access, or other opening to a Class I, Division 2 space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A location that is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 5 feet (1.5m) of a semi-enclosed Class I, Division 1  location indicated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 5 feet (1.5m) of a Class I, Division 1 space indicated  in paragraph (d)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A semi-enclosed area that is below and contiguous with the drill  floor to the boundaries of the derrick or to the extent of any enclosure  which is liable to trap gases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A semi-enclosed derrick to the extent of its enclosure above the  drill floor, or to a height of 10 feet (3m) above the drill floor,  whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an enclosed  space that has an opening into a Class I, Division 2 location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 1 or  Division 2 location is the same division as that location, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 1  location is not a hazardous location if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The access has self-closing gas-tight doors that form an air  lock;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ventilation causes greater pressure in the space than in  the Division 1 location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Loss of ventilation overpressure is alarmed at a manned  station;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 1  location can be considered as a Division 2 location if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The access has a self-closing, gas-tight door that opens into  the space and that has no hold-back device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ventilation causes the air to flow with the door open from the  space into the Division 1 location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Loss of ventilation is alarmed at a manned control station;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 2  location is not a hazardous location if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The access has a self-closing, gas-tight door that opens into  the space and that has no hold-back device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ventilation causes the air to flow with the door open from the  space into the Division 2 location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Loss of ventilation actuates an alarm at a manned control  station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Electrical equipment and devices installed in spaces made non- hazardous by the methods indicated in paragraph (f) of this section must  be limited to essential equipment.</p>
