                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dynamometer specifications. The dynamometer test stand and other  instruments for measurement of power output must meet the accuracy and  calibration frequency requirements shown in table 3 in appendix A of  this subpart. The dynamometer must be capable of performing the test  cycle described in Sec. 89.410.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dynamometer calibration weights. A minimum of six calibration  weights for each range used are required. The weights must be spaced to  reflect good engineering judgement such that they cover the range of  weights required and must be traceable to within 0.5 percent of NIST  weights. Laboratories located in foreign countries may certify  calibration weights to local government bureau standards.  [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated at 63 FR 56995, Oct. 23, 1998]</p>
