The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Controlled foreign corporation X is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation M. X uses the calendar year as the taxable year. The amounts of X's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations at the close of 1975 through 1979 are as follows:
Qualified investments at December 31, 1975.................      $16,000Qualified investments at December 31, 1976.................       17,000Qualified investments at December 31, 1977.................       23,000</p><p class="depth0">Qualified investments at December 31, 1978.................       28,000Qualified investments at December 31, 1979.................       30,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume that M properly files without consent a timely election under Sec. 1.955A-4(b)(1) to determine X's increase for 1976 in qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations pursuant to this paragraph, and that the election remains in force through 1978. Then X's increases for 1976 through 1978 in qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations are as follows:
Increase for 1976 ($23,000 minus $16,000).....................    $7,000Increase for 1977 ($28,000 minus $23,000).....................     5,000Increase for 1978 ($30,000 minus $28,000).....................     2,000</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that M never files an election under Sec. 1.955A-4(b)(1). X's increases for 1976 through 1978 in qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations are as follows:
Increase for 1976 ($17,000 minus $16,000).....................    $1,000Increase for 1977 ($23,000 minus $17,000).....................     6,000Increase for 1978 ($28,000 minus $23,000).....................     5,000</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that X's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations include an investment in less developed country shipping companies described in Sec. 1.955-5(b) of $500 on December 31, 1975, and $750 on December 31, 1976. Assume further that M has made an election under section 955(b)(3) (as in effect before the enactment of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) with respect to X's taxable year 1975. Then X's increase in qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations for 1976 is $6,750 (i.e., $7,000-$250).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustration.
