The total AMS inspection program personnel direct  pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's  percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the  operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable,  travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overtime rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct  pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's  percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus  the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad  debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of  providing the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Holiday rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct  pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's  percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus  benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt.

The total AMS inspection program direct benefits  costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday)  worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar   year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct  benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift  Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operating rate. The total AMS inspection program operating  costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked,  which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Allowance for bad debt rate. Total allowance for bad debt  divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of  inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the  most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic  Assumptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When an inspection is delayed because product is not available  or readily accessible, a charge for waiting time shall be determined  using the formulas in this section.
