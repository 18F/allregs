                                Sec. 1011.18  How does a debtor request a special review based on a change
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material change in circumstances. A debtor who owes a debt may, at any time, request a special review by the Presidio Trust of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, without limitation, catastrophic illness, divorce, death or disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the debtor must submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, the debtor's, and dependents, indicating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Income from all sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liabilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Number of dependents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses for food, housing, clothing and transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Medical expenses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Exceptional expenses, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative payment arrangement. If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor must submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Presidio Trust, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Presidio Trust will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Presidio Trust will notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment or repayment schedule, the Presidio Trust will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.</p>
