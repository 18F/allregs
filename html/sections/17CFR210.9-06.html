                            <p class="depth0">The information prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be presented in  a note to the financial statements when the restricted net assets (Sec.  210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of  consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed   fiscal year. The investment in and indebtedness of and to bank  subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet  from amounts for other subsidiaries; the amount of cash dividends paid  to the registrant for each of the last three years by bank subsidiaries  shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from  amounts for other subsidiaries. For purposes of the above test,  restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that  amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of  consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of  the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the  parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash  dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory  agency, foreign government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of  funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted  as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least  restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks  (Sec. 210.5-02.27) and noncontrolling interests shall be deducted in  computing net assets for purposes of this test.  [48 FR 11107, Mar. 16, 1983, as amended at 74 FR 18616, Apr. 23, 2009]    Sec. 210.9-07  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Interim Financial Statements</p>
