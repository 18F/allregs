                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> LPFM Stations Licensed at Locations That Do Not Satisfy Third-Adjacent Channel Minimum Distance Separations. An LPFM station licensed at a location that does not satisfy the third-adjacent channel minimum distance separations set forth in Sec.  73.807 is subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such an LPFM station will not be permitted to continue to operate if it causes any actual third-adjacent channel interference to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transmission of any authorized broadcast station; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reception of the input signal of any TV translator, TV booster, FM translator or FM booster station; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The direct reception by the public of the off-the-air signals of any authorized broadcast station including TV Channel 6 stations, Class D (secondary) noncommercial educational FM stations, and previously authorized and operating LPFM stations, FM translators and FM booster stations. Interference will be considered to occur whenever reception of a regularly used signal on a third-adjacent channel is impaired by the signals radiated by the LPFM station, regardless of the quality of such reception, the strength of the signal so used, or the channel on which the protected signal is transmitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If third-adjacent channel interference cannot be properly eliminated by the application of suitable techniques, operation of the offending LPFM station shall be suspended and shall not be resumed until the interference has been eliminated. Short test transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures. If a complainant refuses to permit the licensee of the offending LPFM station to apply remedial techniques which demonstrably will eliminate the third-adjacent channel interference without impairment to the original reception, the licensee is absolved of further responsibility for that complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon notice by the Commission to the licensee that such third-adjacent channel interference is being caused, the operation of the LPFM station shall be suspended within three minutes and shall not be resumed until the interference has been eliminated or it can be demonstrated that the interference is not due to spurious emissions by the LPFM station; provided, however, that short test transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> LPFM stations licensed at locations that satisfy third-adjacent channel minimum distance separations. An LPFM station licensed at a location that satisfies the third-adjacent channel minimum distance separations set forth in Sec.  73.807 is subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interference complaints and remediation. (i) Such an LPFM station is required to provide copies of all complaints alleging that its signal is causing third-adjacent channel interference to or impairing the reception of the

signal of a full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station to such affected station and to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such an LPFM station is required to provide copies of all complaints alleging that its signal is causing third-adjacent channel interference to or impairing the reception of the

signal of a full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station to such affected station and to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station shall review all complaints it receives, either directly or indirectly, from listeners regarding alleged third-adjacent channel interference caused by the operations of such an LPFM station. Such full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station shall also identify those that qualify as bona fide complaints under this section and promptly provide such LPFM station with copies of all bona fide complaints. A bona fide complaint:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Must include current contact information for the complainant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Must state the nature and location of the alleged third-adjacent channel interference and must specify the call signs of the LPFM station and affected full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station, and the type of receiver involved; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Must be received by either the LPFM station or the affected full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station within one year of the date on which the LPFM station commenced broadcasts with its currently authorized facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission will accept bona fide complaints and will notify the licensee of the LPFM station allegedly causing third-adjacent channel interference to the signal of a full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station of the existence of the alleged interference within 7 calendar days of the Commission's receipt of such complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Such an LPFM station will be given a reasonable opportunity to resolve all complaints of third-adjacent channel interference within the protected contour of the affected full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station. A complaint will be considered resolved where the complainant does not reasonably cooperate with an LPFM station's remedial efforts. Such an LPFM station also is encouraged to address all other complaints of third-adjacent channel interference, including complaints based on interference to a full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station by the transmitter site of the LPFM station at any distance from the full power, FM translator or FM booster station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the event that the number of unresolved complaints of third-adjacent channel interference within the protected contour of the affected full power FM, FM translator or FM booster station plus the number of complaints for which the source of third-adjacent channel interference remains in dispute equals at least one percent of the households within one kilometer of the LPFM transmitter site or thirty households, whichever is less, the LPFM and affected stations must cooperate in an ``on-off'' test to determine whether the third-adjacent channel interference is traceable to the LPFM station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the number of unresolved and disputed complaints of third-adjacent channel interference within the protected contour of the affected full power, FM translator or FM booster station exceeds the numeric threshold specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section following an ``on-off'' test, the affected station may request that the Commission initiate a proceeding to consider whether the LPFM station license should be modified or cancelled, which will be completed by the Commission within 90 days. Parties may seek extensions of the 90-day deadline consistent with Commission rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An LPFM station may stay any procedures initiated pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section by voluntarily ceasing operations and filing an application for facility modification within twenty days of the commencement of such procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodic announcements. (i) For a period of one year from the date of licensing of a new LPFM station that is constructed on a third-adjacent channel and satisfies the third-adjacent channel minimum distance separations set forth in Sec.  73.807, such LPFM station shall broadcast periodic announcements. The announcements shall, at a minimum, alert listeners of the potentially affected third-adjacent channel station of the potential for interference, instruct listeners to contact

the LPFM station to report any interference, and provide contact information for the LPFM station. The announcements shall be made in the primary language(s) of both the new LPFM station and the potentially affected third-adjacent channel station(s). Sample announcement language follows:</p><p class="depth0">On (date of license grant), the Federal Communications Commission granted (LPFM station's call letters) a license to operate. (LPFM station's call letters) may cause interference to the operations of (third-adjacent channel station's call letters) and (other third-adjacent channel stations' call letters). If you are normally a listener of (third-adjacent channel station's call letters) or (other third-adjacent channel station's call letters) and are having difficulty receiving (third-adjacent channel station call letters) or (other third-adjacent channel station's call letters), please contact (LPFM station's call letters) by mail at (mailing address) or by telephone at (telephone number) to report this interference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During the first thirty days after licensing of a new LPFM station that is constructed on a third-adjacent channel and satisfies the third-adjacent channel minimum distance separations set forth in Section 73.807, the LPFM station must broadcast the announcements specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section at least twice daily. The first daily announcement must be made between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., or 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. The LPFM station must vary the time slot in which it airs this announcement. For stations that do not operate at these times, the announcements shall be made during the first two hours of broadcast operations each day. The second daily announcement must be made outside of the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. time slots. The LPFM station must vary the times of day in which it broadcasts this second daily announcement in order to ensure that the announcements air during all parts of its broadcast day. For stations that do not operate at these times, the announcements shall be made during the first two hours of broadcast operations each day. For the remainder of the one year period, the LPFM station must broadcast the announcements at least twice per week. The announcements must be broadcast between the hours of 7 a.m. and midnight. For stations that do not operate at these times, the announcements shall be made during the first two hours of broadcast operations each day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any new LPFM station that is constructed on a third-adjacent channel and satisfies the minimum distance separations set forth in Sec.  73.807 must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> notify the Audio Division, Media Bureau, and all affected stations on third-adjacent channels of an interference complaint. The notification must be made electronically within 48 hours after the receipt of an interference complaint by the LPFM station; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> cooperate in addressing any third-adjacent channel interference.
