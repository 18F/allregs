Failure of the Lessee receiving the offer to reply within 10 days after receipt thereof shall be deemed as rejection of the offer. If, after indicating acceptance, the two parties cannot agree on the terms of the offer within 30 days, the disposition of such well shall be determined by the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Superintendent is authorized to shut in a lease when the lessee fails to comply with the terms of the lease, the regulations, and/or orders of the Superintendent.
