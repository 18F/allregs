                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The provisions of this section establish procedures  under which claimants may request expedited relief in lieu of the  procedures set forth in Sec. 709.6 of this part. A claimant shall be  entitled to expedited determination of a claim only upon a showing that  there exists a legally valid and enforceable or perfected security  interest in assets of the liquidated credit union and that irreparable  injury will occur if the routine claims procedure is followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing of request for expedited relief. All requests for  expedited relief must be filed within 30 days from the date of mailing,  by the liquidating agent, of the notice to the creditor concerned. The  request shall be deemed to be filed when received by the Secretary of  the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street,  Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. A copy of the request must be simultaneously  served upon the liquidating agent for the credit union concerned. There  shall be no right of personal appearance before the Board in connection  with any claim submitted under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of request for expedited relief. Any Request for  Expedited Relief must contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A clear and concise statement of the facts and issues on which  the request is based;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A clear and concise statement describing the nature of any  security interests in any assets of the credit union;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A clear and concise statement of the probable, imminent and  irreparable harm likely to occur if expedited relief is not granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An assessment of the likelihood of success on the merits of the  underlying claim, including statutory citations and relevant  documentation supporting the merits of the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other relevant documentation that supports the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Citations to applicable statutes, regulations, or other legal  authority; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A signed statement certifying that a copy of the request has  been mailed or hand delivered to the liquidating agent on or before the  day that the request was filed with the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Burden of proof. The burden of proving entitlement to expedited  relief rests at all times with the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional information. The Board may order the filing of  additional information and or documentation in order to make its  determination. Such filing shall be on a date certain, and failure to  provide the additional documentation or information may constitute the  sole grounds for denial of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Decision. Before the end of the 90-day period beginning on the  date a request filed, the Board shall render its decision and provide it  to the requester. The Board will determine whether to grant expedited  review and allow or disallow the claim or whether such claim should be  resolved pursuant to the claims process described in Sec. 709.6 of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Expedited review denied. A decision by the Board that expedited  review is not appropriate shall be final and the claim shall be decided  pursuant to the claims adjudication process set forth in Sec. 709.6 of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expedited review granted. If expedited review is granted, the  Board shall decide the claim. If the claim is disallowed, in whole or  part, the decision shall contain a statement of each reason for the  disallowance and the procedure for obtaining judicial review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Period for filing or renewing suit. Any claimant who files a  request for expedited relief shall be permitted to file a suit, or to  continue a suit filed before the appointment of the liquidating agent,  seeking a determination of the claimant's rights with respect to its  security interest after the earlier of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the filing  of a request for expedited relief; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date the Board denies all or part of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Statute of limitations. If an action described in paragraph (g)  of this section is not filed, or the motion to renew a previously filed  suit is not made, before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the  date on which such action or motion may be filed in accordance with  paragraph (g) of this section, the claim shall be deemed to be  disallowed as of the end of such period (other than any portion of such  claim that was allowed by the Board). Such disallowance shall be final  and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect  to such claim.
