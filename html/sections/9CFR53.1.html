                            <p class="depth0">Accredited veterinarian. A veterinarian approved by the Administrator in accordance with part 161 of this chapter to perform functions specified in parts 1, 2, 3, and 11 of subchapter A of this chapter and subchapters B, C, and D of this chapter, and to perform functions required by cooperative State-Federal disease control and eradication programs.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator. The Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or any person authorized to act for the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (APHIS).</p><p class="depth0">Animals. Livestock, poultry, and all other members of the animal kingdom, including birds whether domesticated or wild, but not including man.</p><p class="depth0">APHIS employee. Any individual employed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who is authorized by the Administrator to do any work or perform any duty in connection with the control and eradication of disease.</p><p class="depth0">Bird. Any member of the class aves other than poultry.</p><p class="depth0">Department. The United States Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth0">Disease. Foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, contagious pleuropneumonia, Newcastle disease, highly pathogenic avian influenza, infectious salmon anemia, spring viremia of carp, or any other communicable disease of livestock or poultry that in the opinion of the Secretary constitutes an emergency and threatens the livestock or poultry of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any influenza virus that kills at least 75 percent of eight 4- to 6-week-old susceptible chickens within 10 days following intravenous inoculation with 0.2 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a bacteria-free, infectious allantoic fluid;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any H5 or H7 virus that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (1) of this definition, but has an amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site that is compatible with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any influenza virus that is not an H5 or H7 subtype and that kills one to five chickens and grows in cell culture in the absence of trypsin.</p><p class="depth2">Inspector in charge. An APHIS employee who is designated by the Administrator to take charge of work in connection with the control and eradication of disease.</p><p class="depth2">ISA Program veterinarian. The APHIS veterinarian assigned to manage the infectious salmon anemia program for APHIS in the State of Maine and who reports to the Area Veterinarian in Charge.</p><p class="depth2">Materials. Parts of barns or other structures, straw, hay, and other feed for animals, farm products or equipment, clothing, and articles stored in or adjacent to barns or other structures.</p><p class="depth2">Mortgage. Any mortgage, lien, or other security or beneficial interest held by any person other than the one claiming indemnity.</p><p class="depth2">Newcastle disease. Newcastle disease is an acute, rapidly spreading, and usually fatal viral infection of poultry caused by an avian paramyxovirus

serotype 1 that meets one of the following criteria for virulence: The virus has an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks (Gallus gallus) of 0.7 or greater; or multiple basic amino acids have been demonstrated in the virus (either directly or by deduction) at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and phenylalanine at residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F1 protein. The term ``multiple basic amino acids'' refers to at least three arginine or lysine residues between residues 113 and 116. In this definition, amino acid residues are numbered from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the F0 gene; 113-116 corresponds to residues -4 to -1 from the cleavage site. Failure to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as described above may require characterization of the isolated virus by an ICPI test. A failure to detect a cleavage site that is consistent with virulent strains does not confirm the absence of a virulent virus.</p><p class="depth2">Person. Any individual, corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, or other legal entity.</p><p class="depth2">Pet bird. Any bird that is kept for personal pleasure and is not for sale.</p><p class="depth2">Poultry. Chickens, ducks, geese, swans, turkeys, pigeons, doves, pheasants, grouse, partridges, quail, guinea fowl, and pea fowl.</p><p class="depth2">Secretary. The Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, or any officer or employee of the Department to whom authority has been or may be delegated to act in the Secretary's stead.</p><p class="depth2">State. Each of the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, or any other territory or possession of the United States.
