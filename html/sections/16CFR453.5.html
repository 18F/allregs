In selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any provider to embalm a deceased human body for a fee unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State or local law or regulation requires embalming in the particular circumstances regardless of any funeral choice which the family might make; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior approval for embalming (expressly so described) has been obtained from a family member or other authorized person; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The funeral provider is unable to contact a family member or other authorized person after exercising due diligence, has no reason to believe the family does not want embalming performed, and obtains subsequent approval for embalming already performed (expressly so described). In seeking approval, the funeral provider must disclose that a fee will be charged if the family selects a funeral which requires embalming, such as a funeral with viewing, and that no fee will be charged if the family selects a service which does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate burial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preventive requirement. To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices, funeral providers must include on the itemized statement of funeral goods and services selected, required by Sec. 453.2(b)(5), the statement: ``If you selected a funeral that may require embalming, such as a funeral with viewing, you may have to pay for embalming. You do not have to pay for embalming you did not approve if you selected arrangements such as a direct cremation or immediate burial. If we charged for embalming, we will explain why below.''</p>
