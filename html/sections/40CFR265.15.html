                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator must inspect his facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and discharges which may be causing--or may lead to: (1) Release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment or (2) a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these in spec tions often enough to identify prob lems in time to correct them before they harm human health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The owner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting all monitoring equip ment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are import ant to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or human health hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting all monitoring equip ment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are import ant to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or human health hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> He must keep this schedule at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The schedule must identify the types of problems (e.g., malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during the inspection (e.g., inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, eroding dike, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The frequency of inspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency should be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the probability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas subject to spills, such as loading and unloading

areas, must be inspected daily when in use, except for Performance Track member facilities, that must inspect at least once each month, upon approval by the Director, as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and frequencies called for in Secs. 265.174, 265.193, 265.195, 265.226, 265.260, 265.278, 265.304, 265.347, 265.377, 265.403, 265.1033, 265.1052, 265.1053, 265.1058, and 265.1084 through 265.1090, where applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Performance Track member facilities that choose to reduce inspection frequencies must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit an application to the Director. The application must identify the facility as a member of the National Environmental Performance Track Program and identify the management units for reduced inspections and the proposed frequency of inspections. Inspections must be conducted at least once each month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 60 days, the Director will notify the Performance Track member facility, in writing, if the application is approved, denied, or if an extension to the 60-day deadline is needed. This notice must be placed in the facility's operating record. The Performance Track member facility should consider the application approved if the Director does not: (1) Deny the application; or (2) notify the Performance Track member facility of an extension to the 60-day deadline. In these situations, the Performance Track member facility must adhere to the revised inspection schedule outlined in its application and maintain a copy of the application in the facility's operating record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any Performance Track member facility that discontinues its membership or is terminated from the program must immediately notify the Director of its change in status. The facility must place in its operating record a dated copy of this notification and revert back to the non-Performance Track inspection frequencies within seven calendar days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator must remedy any deterioration or malfunction of equipment or structures which the inspection reveals on a schedule which ensures that the problem does not lead to an environmental or human health hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, remedial action must be taken immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator must record inspections in an inspection log or summary. He must keep these records for at least three years from the date of inspection. At a minimum, these records must include the date and time of the inspection, the name of the inspector, a notation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any repairs or other remedial actions.
