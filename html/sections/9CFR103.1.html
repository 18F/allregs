                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this section, experimental biological products which are neither composed of nor prepared with organisms or antigens used in biologicals already licensed, shall not be prepared in the production facilities of a licensed establishment. Upon application therefor, the Administrator may authorize the preparation of experimental products on the premises of a licensed establishment if he determines that such preparation will not result in contamination of the licensed products. Each request for permission to prepare an experimental biological product on licensed premises shall indicate the nature of the unlicensed product, designate facilities to be used, and specify precautions which will be taken to prevent contamination of licensed products. Such requests shall be submitted to the Administrator. Research facilities that are entirely separate and apart from facilities used for the preparation of licensed biological products will not be considered a part of the licensed premises for purposes of this section.
