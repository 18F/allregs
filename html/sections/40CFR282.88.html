                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's underground storage tank program is approved in lieu of the Federal program in accordance with Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq. The State's program, as administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. EPA approved the Pennsylvania underground storage tank program on September 11, 2003, and approval was effective on September 11, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commonwealth has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities in accordance with sections 9005 and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, regardless of whether the State has taken its own actions, as well as in accordance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> To retain program approval, the Commonwealth must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program that make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If the Commonwealth obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Commonwealth has final approval for the following elements submitted to EPA in the State's program application for final approval. On September 11, 2003, EPA published a rule approving the State's program in the Federal Register, 66 FR 53520. That approval became effective on September 11, 2003.
