In addition, the following definition shall apply:</p><p class="depth0">Audit means an examination of the financial accounting and lease related records of the lessee and other interest holders, who by lease or contract pay royalties or are obligated to pay royalties, rents, bonuses or other payments on Federal or Indian leases. An examination is to be conducted in accordance with generally accepted audit standards as adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Activities to be examined which are considered to be an audit function include reconciliation of lease accounts under the Royalty Accounting System; records of lease activities related to Federal leases located within the boundaries of the State entering into a cooperative agreement; records of lease activities related to leases located on Indian lands, and the review and resolution of exceptions processed by the official accounting systems for royalty reporters and payors maintained by the ONRR.
