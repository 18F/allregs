                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing of motions, answers. Any party who believes that there is  no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he is  entitled to a decision as a matter of law concerning all issues of  liability in the proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition at  any time until the parties have concluded their submissions of proof.  Any adverse party, within ten (10) days after service of the motion, may  file and serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary  disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supporting papers. A motion for summary disposition shall  include a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party  contends there is no genuine issue, supported by the pleadings, and by  affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and  interrogatories. The motion may also be supported by briefs containing  points and authorities in   support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion  is made and supported as provided in this section, unless otherwise  ordered by the Judgment Officer, an adverse party may not rest upon the  mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement  setting forth those material facts as to which he contends a genuine  issue exists, supported by affidavits and other verified material. He  may also submit a brief of points and authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Summary disposition upon motion of the Judgment Officer. If the  Judgment Officer believes that there may be no genuine issue of material  fact to be determined and that one of the parties may be entitled to a  decision as a matter of law, he may direct the parties to submit papers  in support of and in opposition to summary disposition, substantially as  provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ruling on summary disposition. The Judgment Officer may grant  summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, affidavits, other  verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and matters of official  notice show that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact;  (2) there is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record;  and (3) a party is entitled to a decision in his favor as a matter of  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review of ruling; appeal. An application for interlocutory  review of an order denying a motion for summary disposition shall not be  allowed. An order granting summary disposition as to all of the issues  and all of the parties in the proceeding shall have the same effect as  an initial decision (see Sec. 12.210(d)), and may be appealed to the  Commission, in accordance with Sec. 12.401 of these rules.</p>
