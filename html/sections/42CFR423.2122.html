(1) If the MAC is reviewing an ALJ's decision, the MAC will consider the evidence contained in the record of the proceedings before the ALJ, and any new evidence that relates to the period before the coverage determination. If the hearing decision decides a new issue that the enrollee was not afforded an opportunity to address at the ALJ level, the MAC considers any evidence related to that issue that is submitted with the request for review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MAC is reviewing an ALJ's decision, the MAC will consider the evidence contained in the record of the proceedings before the ALJ, and any new evidence that relates to the period before the coverage determination. If the hearing decision decides a new issue that the enrollee was not afforded an opportunity to address at the ALJ level, the MAC considers any evidence related to that issue that is submitted with the request for review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the MAC determines that additional evidence is needed to resolve the issues in the case and the hearing record indicates that the previous decision-makers have not attempted to obtain the evidence, the MAC may remand the case to an ALJ to obtain the evidence and issue a new decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The MAC will not consider any new evidence submitted regarding a change in condition of an enrollee after a coverage determination is made.

When it is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, the MAC may, on its own initiative, issue subpoenas requiring an enrollee or Part D plan sponsor to make books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to an issue at the hearing available for inspection and copying. The MAC may not issue a subpoena to CMS, or the IRE to compel the production of evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To the extent a subpoena compels disclosure of a matter for which an objection based on privilege, or other protection from disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality or undue burden, was made before the MAC, the Secretary may review immediately that subpoena or a portion of the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon notice to the MAC that an enrollee or Part D plan sponsor intends to seek the Secretary review of the subpoena, the MAC must stay all proceedings affected by the subpoena, tolling the time period for the MAC to issue a final action or remand a case in response to a request for review for 15 calendar days or until the Secretary makes a decision with respect to the review request, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary does not grant review within the time allotted for the stay, the stay is lifted and the subpoena stands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement. (1) If the MAC determines that an enrollee or other person or entity subject to a subpoena issued under this section has refused to comply with the subpoena, the MAC may request the Secretary to seek enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with section 205(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 405(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MAC determines that an enrollee or other person or entity subject to a subpoena issued under this section has refused to comply with the subpoena, the MAC may request the Secretary to seek enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with section 205(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 405(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After submitting the enforcement request, the time period for the MAC to issue a final action or remand a case in response to a request for review is stayed for 15 calendar days or until the Secretary makes a decision with respect to the enforcement request, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any enforcement request by the MAC must consist of a written notice to the Secretary describing in detail the MAC's findings of noncompliance and its specific request for enforcement, and providing a copy of the subpoena and evidence of its receipt by certified mail by the enrollee or other person or entity subject to the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The MAC must promptly mail a copy of the notice and related documents to the enrollee or other person or entity subject to the subpoena, and to any other affected person.</p>
