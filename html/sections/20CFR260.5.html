                                Sec. 260.5  Appeal from a reconsideration decision.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Every claimant shall have a right to appeal to the  Bureau of Hearings and Appeals from any reconsideration decision with  which he or she disagrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal from a reconsideration decision. Appeal from a  reconsideration decision shall be made by filing the form prescribed by  the Board for such purpose. Such appeal must be filed with the Bureau of  Hearings and Appeals within 60 days from the date upon which notice of  the reconsideration decision is mailed to the claimant. Any written  request stating an intent to appeal which is received within the 60-day  period will protect the claimant's right to appeal, provided that the  claimant files the appeal form within the later of the 60-day period  following the date of the reconsideration decision, or the 30-day period  following the date of the letter sending the form to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Right to review of a reconsideration decision. The right to  review of a reconsideration decision shall be forfeited unless an appeal  is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in this section.  However, when a claimant fails to file an appeal with the Bureau of  Hearings and Appeals within the time prescribed in this section, the  hearings officer may waive this requirement of timeliness. Such waiver  shall only occur in cases where the claimant has made a showing of good  cause for failure to file a timely appeal. Good cause for failure to  file a timely appeal will be determined by a hearings officer in the  manner prescribed in Sec. 260.3(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delay in the commencement of recovery of erroneous payment.  Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous payment  has been filed with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, the Board shall  not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or  reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision  with respect to such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice  thereof has been mailed to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Impartial review. Within 30 days after the claimant has filed a  proper appeal, the Director of Hearings and Appeals shall appoint a  hearings officer to act on the appeal. The Director of Hearings and  Appeals may, if the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals' caseload dictates,  appoint a qualified Board employee, other than a hearings officer  assigned to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, to act as a hearings  officer with respect to a case. Such hearings officer shall not have any  interest in the parties or in the outcome of the proceedings, shall not  have directly participated in the initial decision or the  reconsideration decision from which the appeal is made, and shall not  have any other interest in the matter which might prevent a fair and  impartial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Power of hearings officer to conduct hearings. In the  development of appeals, the hearings officer shall have the power to  hold hearings, require and compel the attendance of witnesses by  subpoena or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in  part 258 of this chapter, administer oaths, rule on motions, take  testimony, and make all necessary investigations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence presented in support of appeal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appellant, or  his or her representative, shall be afforded full opportunity to present  testimony, or written evidence or exhibits upon any controversial  question of fact; to examine and cross-examine witnesses; and to present  argument in support of the appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The formal rules of evidence shall not apply; however, the  hearings officer may exclude evidence which he or she finds is  irrelevant or repetitious. Any evidence excluded by the hearings officer  shall be described and that description made part of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, in the judgment of the hearings officer, evidence not  offered by the appellant is available and is relevant and material to  the merits of the claim, the   hearings officer may obtain such evidence upon his or her own  initiative. If new evidence is obtained after an oral hearing, other  than evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative,  the hearings officer shall provide the appellant or his or her  representative with a copy of such evidence. In such event, the  appellant shall have 30 days to submit rebuttal evidence or argument or  to request a supplemental hearing to confront and challenge such new  evidence. The appellant may move for an extension of time to submit  rebuttal evidence or argument and the hearings officer may grant the  motion upon a showing of good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Submission of written argument in lieu of oral hearings. Where  the hearings officer finds that no factual issues are presented by an  appeal, and the only issues raised by the appellant are issues  concerning the application or interpretation of law, the appellant or  his or her representative shall be afforded full opportunity to submit  written argument in support of the claim but no oral hearing shall be  held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Conduct of an oral hearing. (1) In any case in which an oral  hearing is to be held, the hearings officer shall schedule a time and  place for the conduct of the hearing. At the discretion of the hearings  officer, any hearing required under this part may be held in person, by  telephone conference call, or by video teleconferencing as described in  Sec. 260.5</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. The hearing shall not be open to the public. The  hearings officer shall promptly notify by mail the party or parties to  the proceeding as to the time and place for the hearing. The notice  shall include a statement of the specific issues involved in the case.  The hearings officer shall make every effort to hold the hearing within  150 days after the date the appeal is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the appellant objects to the time or place of the hearing, he  or she must notify the hearings officer no later than 5 calendar days  before the time set for the hearing. The appellant must state the reason  for his or her objection. If at all possible, the request should be in  writing. The hearings officer will change the time or place of the  hearing if he or she finds there is good cause to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The hearings officer shall rule on any objection timely filed by  a party under paragraph (i) of this section and shall notify the party  of his or her ruling thereon. The hearings officer may for good cause  shown, or upon his or her own motion, reschedule the time and/or place  of the hearing. If an individual objects to having a hearing by video  teleconferencing, the hearings officer will find the individual's wish  not to appear by video teleconferencing to be a good reason for changing  the time or place of the scheduled hearing and will reschedule the  hearing for a time or place where either a telephone conference call or  an in person hearing will be held. The hearings officer may also limit  or expand the issues to be resolved at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If neither a party nor his or her representative appears at the  time and place scheduled for the hearing, that party shall be deemed to  have waived his or her right to an oral hearing unless said party either  filed with the hearings officer a notice of objection showing good cause  why the hearing should have been rescheduled, which notice was timely  filed but not ruled upon, or, within 10 days following the date on which  the hearing was scheduled, said party files with the hearings officer a  motion to reschedule the hearing showing good cause why neither the  party nor his or her representative appeared at the hearing and further  showing good cause as to why said party failed to file at the prescribed  time any notice of objection to the time and place of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the hearings officer finds either that a notice of objection  was timely filed showing good cause to reschedule the hearing, or that  the party has within 10 days following the date of the hearing filed a  motion showing good cause for failure to appear and to file a notice of  objection, the hearings officer shall reschedule the hearing. If the  hearings officer finds that the hearing shall not be rescheduled, he or  she shall so notify the party in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Record of evidence considered. The hearings officer will make a  record of the material evidence. The record will include the  applications, written statements, reports, and other documents   that were used in making the determination under review and any other  additional evidence the appellant or any other party to the hearing  presents in writing. If a hearing was held in the appeal, the tape  recording of the hearing will be part of the record while the appeal is  pending. The hearings officer's decision will be based on the record.  The entire record at any time during the pendency of the appeal shall be  available for examination by the appellant or by his or her duly  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Extension of time to submit evidence. Except where the hearings  officer has determined that additional evidence not offered by the  appellant at or prior to the hearing is available, the record shall be  closed as of the conclusion of the hearing. The appellant may request an  extension of time to submit evidence and the hearings officer will grant  the request upon a showing of good cause for failure to have submitted  the evidence earlier. The extension shall be for a period not exceeding  30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Hearing by telephone or video teleconferencing. As stated in  paragraph (i)(1) of this section, at the discretion of the hearings  officer, any hearing required under this part may be conducted in  person, by telephone conference call, or by video teleconferencing. The  hearings officer may determine the hearing should be conducted by  telephone conference call or video teleconferencing if use of these  methods would be more efficient than conducting an in person hearing and  the hearings officer does not determine that there is a circumstance in  the particular case preventing the use of these methodologies to conduct  the hearing.  (The information collection requirements contained in paragraph (b) were  approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  3220-0007)  [67 FR 77154, Dec. 17, 2002 as amended at 71 FR 55283, Sept. 22, 2006]</p>
