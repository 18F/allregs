Any  extension shall be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No extension shall exceed a period equal to the unexpired  portion of the lease or any extension thereof remaining at the date of  termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the reinstatement occurs after the expiration of the term  or extension thereof, the lease may be extended from the date the  authorized officer grants the petition, but in no event for more than 2  years from the date the reinstatement is authorized and so long  thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
