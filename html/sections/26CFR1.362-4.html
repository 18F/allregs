The examples in this paragraph (h) illustrate the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. For purposes of these examples, X, Y, P, S, S1, S2, and DC are domestic corporations; A and B are U.S. individuals; FC1 and FC2 are foreign corporations and, unless otherwise indicated, are not required to file a U.S. return and are not CFCs; and PRS is a domestic partnership. Unless the facts indicate otherwise, all persons and transactions are unrelated; Acquiring's basis in the transferred property is not determined under section 362(e)(1); the property transferred is not described in section 362(e)(1)(B); no election is made under section 362(e)(2)(C), and the transactions are not subject to recharacterization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basic application of section. (A) Facts. A owns Asset 1 (basis $90, value $60) and Asset 2 (basis $110, value $120).

A's transfer of Asset 1 and Asset 2 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's aggregate basis in those assets would be $200 ($90 + $110), which would exceed the aggregate value of the assets $180 ($60 + $120) immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $20 ($200-$180).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifying loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $90, which would exceed Asset 1's $60 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 2 would be $110, which would not exceed Asset 2's $120 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is not loss duplication property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Basis in loss duplication property. X's basis in Asset 1 is $70, computed as its $90 basis under section 362(a) reduced by A's $20 net built-in loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Basis in other property. Under section 362(a), X has a transferred basis of $110 in Asset 2. Under section 358(a), A has an exchanged basis of $200 in the X stock it receives in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 362(e)(2)(C) election. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this Example 1, except that A and X make an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, A reduces its basis in the X stock, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, by the amount of A's net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made. In addition, no reduction is made to X's basis in Asset 1, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $180 ($200-$20), X's basis in Asset 1 is $90, and X's basis in Asset 2 is $110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basic application of section--(A) Facts. P owns the sole outstanding share of S1 stock and the ten outstanding shares of S2 stock. In a transaction to which section 351 applies and that is described in section 368(a)(1)(B), P transfers its ten S2 shares to S1 in exchange for an additional ten shares of S1 voting stock. At the time of the transfer, P has a basis of $10 each in five of its S2 shares (Shares 1-5) and a basis of $5 each in its other five S2 shares (Shares 6-10), and the value of each share is $7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facts. P owns the sole outstanding share of S1 stock and the ten outstanding shares of S2 stock. In a transaction to which section 351 applies and that is described in section 368(a)(1)(B), P transfers its ten S2 shares to S1 in exchange for an additional ten shares of S1 voting stock. At the time of the transfer, P has a basis of $10 each in five of its S2 shares (Shares 1-5) and a basis of $5 each in its other five S2 shares (Shares 6-10), and the value of each share is $7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Analysis--(1) Loss duplication transaction. P's transfer of the S2 shares is a section 362(a) transaction notwithstanding that

it is also a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B) and therefore section 362(b). But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's aggregate basis in the S2 shares would be $75 ($10 x 5, or $50, for Shares 1-5 + $5 x 5, or $25, for Shares 6-10). Thus, S1's $75 aggregate basis in the shares would exceed the aggregate value of the shares, $70 ($7 x 10 shares), immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and P has a net built-in loss of $5 ($75-$70).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifying loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's basis in each of Shares 1-5 would be $10, which would exceed each share's $7 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Shares 1-5 are each loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's basis in each of Shares 6-10 would be $5, which would not exceed each share's $7 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Shares 6-10 are not loss duplication property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Basis in loss duplication property. S1's basis in each of Shares 1-5 is $9, computed as its $10 basis (determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section) reduced by $1, the share's allocable portion (1/5) of P's net built-in loss ($5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Basis in other property. Under section 362(a), S1 has a transferred basis of $5 in each of Shares 6-10. Under section 358(a), P has an exchanged basis in the ten S1 shares it receives in the exchange ($10 in each of the five S1 shares received in exchange for Shares 1-5 and $5 in each of the five S1 shares received in exchange for Shares 5-10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 362(e)(2)(C) election. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this Example 2, except that an election under section 362(e)(2)(C) is made to reduce P's basis in the shares of S1 stock received in the exchange. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, P reduces its basis in the S1 stock by $5, the amount of P's net built-in loss that S1's basis in the S2 shares would have been reduced under section 362(e)(2) and this section had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made, and no reduction is made to S1's basis in the S2 stock (as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section). Because an election is being made under section 362(e)(2)(C), P's basis in the new S1 shares is not determined under the general rule of Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2)(i) (under which P's basis in each new S1 share would be equal to the basis of the S2 share transferred in exchange for the S1 share). Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(viii)(B). Accordingly, P's basis in each new S1 share will be $7, the share's allocable portion of P's $75 aggregate basis in the S2 shares transferred in the transaction (or, $7.50 per share), reduced under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the $5 that would have been applied to reduce S1's basis in the S2 shares had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made (or $.50 per share).

In the merger, B receives X stock with a basis equal to B's basis in its Y stock immediately before the merger. A's transfer of Asset 1 to X in exchange for X stock and Y's transfer of Asset 2 to X in the merger are both transactions to which section 351 applies.

Accordingly, A's transfer of Asset 1 is not a loss duplication transaction notwithstanding that, taking both A's transfer and Y's transfer into account, X has an aggregate net loss in Asset 1 and Asset 2.

Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X's basis in Asset 2 is not determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section.

The aggregate value of the assets immediately after the transaction is $420 ($70 + $110 + $240). Thus, Y's aggregate basis in the assets would exceed the aggregate value of the assets immediately after the transaction.

(A's basis in the Y stock will be determined by reference to his basis in his X stock.) Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Y's bases in Asset 1 and Asset 2 are determined under section 362(a) and not under section 362(e)(2) and this section.

Because section 361(c)(2), and not section 361(c)(1), will apply to X's distribution of Y stock, X will not qualify for nonrecognition treatment on the distribution of the Y stock. As a result, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to the transaction, and Y's bases in Asset 1 and Asset 2, the loss duplication property, are determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section. Asset 1 has a built-in loss of $50 ($120 - $70), and Asset 2 has a built-in loss of $50 ($160 - $110).

Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies only to the extent that stock received in a transaction is distributed without recognition of gain or loss. Thus, section 362(e)(2) and this section apply to the extent that property was exchanged for the retained Y stock and Y securities (2 percent of the total). Accordingly, Y reduces its basis in Asset 1 and in Asset 2, the loss duplication property, by $1.60 (two percent of X's $80 net built-in loss). Asset 1 has a built-in loss of $50 ($120 - $70), and Asset 2 has a built-in loss of $50 ($160 - $110). Thus, Asset 1's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $.80 ($50/$100 x $1.60), and Asset 2's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $.80 ($50/$100 x

Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, X reduces its basis in the retained Y stock and the retained Y securities (determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section) by $1.60, the portion of X's $80 net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce Y's basis in the transferred assets had the election to apply section 362(e)(2)(C) not been made. (Because the value of the Y stock and the value of the Y securities are equal, X's $500 basis in the transferred property would be allocated equally between the Y stock and the Y securities, $250 to each, under Sec. 1.358-2(b)(2), and the retained Y stock and Y securities have a basis of $2.50 each (one percent of $250).) For the reasons set forth in paragraph (ii)(B) of this Example 4, Y would have been required to reduce its basis in the transferred assets by $1.60. Accordingly, X must reduce its aggregate basis in the retained Y stock and Y securities by $1.60. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the $1.60 basis reduction is allocated and applied to reduce X's bases in the retained Y stock and Y securities in proportion to the value of each. Because X retained Y stock and Y securities with equal values, X holds each of the retained Y stock and securities with an adjusted basis of $1.70 ($2.50 - $.80).

A's transfer of Asset 1 and Asset 2 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's aggregate basis in those assets would be $130, computed as follows. Under section 362(a), a corporation's basis in property acquired in a transaction to which section 351 applies is the same as the property's basis in the hands of the transferor, increased by any gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer. Under section 351(b), gain (but not loss) is recognized to the extent a transferor in a section 351 exchange receives other property or money in addition to the stock permitted to be received without the recognition of gain. To determine the amount of gain recognized under section 351(b), the consideration is allocated proportionately (by value) among the transferred properties. A's gain on the transfer is therefore computed as follows: Asset 1 reflects 80 percent of the value transferred ($100/$125) and Asset 2 reflects 20 percent of the value transferred ($25/$125). Thus, 80 percent of the stock (eight shares) and the cash ($20) are treated as being received in exchange for Asset 1 and 20 percent of the stock (two shares) and the cash ($5) are treated as being received in exchange for Asset 2. Thus, under section 351(b), A recognizes $20 of gain for the cash received in exchange for Asset 1, but A recognizes no loss for the amount received for Asset 2. As a result, under section 362(a), X would have a basis of $100 in Asset 1 and $30 in Asset 2.

FC3's becoming engaged in a U.S. trade or business is an event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section because FC3, a person who holds loss duplication property with a basis determined by FC2's basis in the property, will be required to file a U.S. return as a result of its becoming engaged in a U.S. business. As a result, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not except the transfer from the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, FC3 must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement for the original transfer on or with its Year 2 U.S. return in order for the section 362(e)(2)(C) election for the original transfer to be effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability date.

To the extent the regulations provide that the U.S. transferor recognizes gain with respect to a particular item of property, the foreign corporation increases its basis in that item of property by the amount of such gain recognized. For example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3, 1.367(a)-4T, and 1.367(a)-5T provide that gain is recognized with respect to particular items of property. To the extent the regulations do not provide that gain recognized by the U.S. transferor is with respect to a particular item of property, such gain is treated as recognized with respect to items of property subject to section 367(a) in proportion to the U.S. transferor's gain realized in such property, after taking into account gain recognized with respect to particular items of property transferred under any other provision of section 367(a). For example, Sec. 1.367(a)-6T provides that branch losses must be recaptured by the recognition of gain realized on the transfer but does not associate the gain with particular items of property.

Sec. 1.367(a)-1T  Transfers to foreign corporations subject to section 367(a): In general (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope of regulations. These regulations set forth rules relating to the provisions of section 367(a) concerning certain transfers of property to foreign corportions. This section provides general rules explaining the effect of section 367(a)(1) and describing the transfers of property that are subject to the rule of that section. Section 1.367(a)-2T provides rules concerning the exception from the rule of section 367(a)(1) for transfers of property to be used in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States. Rules concerning the application of section 367(a)(1) to transfers of stock or securities are provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-3, while Sec. 1.367(a)-4T provides special rules regarding other specified transfers of property. Section 1.367(a)-5T describes types of property that are subject to the rule of section 367(a)(1) regardless of whether they are transferred for use in a trade or business. Section 1.367(a)-6T provides rules concerning the application of section 367(a) to the transfer of a branch with previously deducted losses. Finally, Sec. 1.367(a)-7T contains transitional rules concerning transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations made after June 6, 1984 and before January 1, 1985. Rules explaining the operation of section 367(d), concerning transfers of intangible property pursuant to an exchange described in section 351 or 361, are provided in Sec. 1.367(d)-1T. Rules concerning the reporting requirements of section 6038B are provided in Sec. Sec. 1.6038B-1 and 1.6038B-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules--(1) Foreign corporation not considered a corporation for purposes of certain transfers. If a U.S. person transfers property to a foreign corporation in connection with an exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, then pursuant to section 367(a)(1) the foreign corporation shall not be considered to be a corporation for purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be recognized on the transfer. Section 367(a)(1) denies nonrecognition treatment only to transfers of items of property on which gain is realized. Thus, the amount of gain recognized because of section 367(a)(1) is unaffected by the transfer of items of property on which loss is realized (but not recognized). The transfers of property that are subject to section 367(a)(1) are further described in paragraph (c) of this section, and relevant definitions are provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Foreign corporation not considered a corporation for purposes of certain transfers. If a U.S. person transfers property to a foreign corporation in connection with an exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, then pursuant to section 367(a)(1) the foreign corporation shall not be considered to be a corporation for purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be recognized on the transfer. Section 367(a)(1) denies nonrecognition treatment only to transfers of items of property on which gain is realized. Thus, the amount of gain recognized because of section 367(a)(1) is unaffected by the transfer of items of property on which loss is realized (but not recognized). The transfers of property that are subject to section 367(a)(1) are further described in paragraph (c) of this section, and relevant definitions are provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cases in which foreign corporate status is not disregarded. Section 367(a)(1) shall not apply, and a foreign corporate transferee shall, thus, be considered to be a corporation, in the case of any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transfer of property for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States in accordance with the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-2T through 1.367(a)-6T; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain other transfers of property described in Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-2T through 1.367(a)-6T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation of gain required to be recognized--(i) In general. If a U.S. person transfers property to a foreign corporation in a transaction on which gain is required to be recognized under section 367(a) and regulations thereunder, then the gain required to be recognized by the U.S. person shall in no event exceed the gain that would have been recognized on a taxable sale of those items of property if sold individually and

without offsetting individual losses against individual gains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a U.S. person transfers property to a foreign corporation in a transaction on which gain is required to be recognized under section 367(a) and regulations thereunder, then the gain required to be recognized by the U.S. person shall in no event exceed the gain that would have been recognized on a taxable sale of those items of property if sold individually and

without offsetting individual losses against individual gains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Losses. No loss may be recognized by reason of the operation of section 367.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ordinary income and capital gain. If section 367(a) and regulations thereunder require the recognition of ordinary income and capital gain in excess of the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then the limitation shall be imposed by making proportionate reductions in the amounts or ordinary income and capital gain, regardless of the character of the gain that would have been recognized on a taxable sale of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Character, source, and adjustments--(i) In general. If a U.S. person is required to recognize gain under section 367 upon a transfer of property to a foreign corporation, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a U.S. person is required to recognize gain under section 367 upon a transfer of property to a foreign corporation, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The character and source of such gain shall be determined as if the property had been disposed of in a taxable exchange with the transferee foreign corporation (unless otherwise provided by regulation); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance see Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance see Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (b)(4) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Domestic corporation DC transfers inventory with a fair market value of $1 million and adjusted basis of $800,000 to foreign corporation FC in an exchange for stock of FC that is described in section 351 (a). Title passes within the U.S. Pursuant to section 367(a), DC is required to recognize gain of $200,000 upon the transfer. Under the rule of this paragraph (b)(4), such gain shall be treated as ordinary income (sections 1201 and 1221) from sources within the U.S. (section 861) arising from a taxable exchange with FC. Appropriate adjustments to earnings and profits, basis, etc., shall be made as if the transfer were subject to section 351. Thus, for example, DC's basis in the FC stock received, and FC's basis in the transferred inventory, will each be increased by the $200,000 gain recognized by DC, pursuant to sections 358(a)(1) and 362(a), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfers described in section 367(a)(1)--(1) In general. A transfer described in section 367(a)(1) is any transfer of property by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation pursuant to an exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361. Section 367(a)(1) applies to such a transfer whether it is made directly, indirectly, or constructively. Indirect or constructive transfers that are described in section 367(a)(1) include the transfers described in subparagraphs (2) through (7) of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)--(1)</em> In general. A transfer described in section 367(a)(1) is any transfer of property by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation pursuant to an exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361. Section 367(a)(1) applies to such a transfer whether it is made directly, indirectly, or constructively. Indirect or constructive transfers that are described in section 367(a)(1) include the transfers described in subparagraphs (2) through (7) of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indirect transfers in certain reorganizations. [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(a)-3(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect transfers involving partnerships and interests therein--(i) Transfer by partnership treated as transfer by partners--(A) In general. If a partnership (whether foreign or domestic) transfers property to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1), then a U.S. person that is a partner in the partnership shall be treated as having transferred a proportionate share of the property in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1). A U.S. person's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder. The rule of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) is illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. P is a partnership having five equal general partners, two of whom are United States persons. P transfers property to F, a foreign corporation, in connection with an exchange described in section 351. The exchange includes an indirect transfer of property by the partners to F. The transfers of property attributable to those partners who are United States persons, that is, 40 percent of each asset transferred to F, are transfers described in section 367(a)(1). The gain (if any) recognized on the transfer of 40 percent of each asset to F is attributable to the two partners who are United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special adjustments to basis. If a U.S. person is treated under the rule of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) as having transferred a proportionate share of the property of a partnership in an exchange described in section 367(a), and is therefore required to recognize gain upon the transfer, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The U.S. person's basis in the partnership shall be increased by the amount of gain recognized by him;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Solely for purposes of determining the basis of the partnership in the

stock of the transferee foreign corporation, the U.S. person shall be treated as having newly acquired an interest in the partnership (for an amount equal to the gain recognized), permitting the partnership to make an optional adjustment to basis pursuant to sections 743 and 754; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The transferee foreign corporation's basis in the property acquired from the partnership shall be increased by the amount of gain recognized by U.S. persons under this paragraph (c)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer of partnership interest treated as transfer of proportionate share of assets--(A) In general. If a U.S. person transfers an interest as a partner in a partnership (whether foreign or domestic) in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1), then that person shall be treated as having transferred a proportionate share of the property of the partnership in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1). Accordingly, the applicability of the exception to section 367(a)(1) provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-2T shall be determined with reference to the property of the partnership rather than the partnership interest itself. A U.S. person's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a U.S. person transfers an interest as a partner in a partnership (whether foreign or domestic) in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1), then that person shall be treated as having transferred a proportionate share of the property of the partnership in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1). Accordingly, the applicability of the exception to section 367(a)(1) provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-2T shall be determined with reference to the property of the partnership rather than the partnership interest itself. A U.S. person's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special adjustments to basis. If a U.S. person is treated under the rule of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section as having transferred a proportionate share of the property of a partnership in an exchange described in section 367(a), and is therefore required to recognize gain upon the transfer, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The U.S. person's basis in the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be increased by the amount of gain so recognized by that person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transferee foreign corporation's basis in the transferred partnership interest shall be increased by the amount of gain recognized by the U.S. person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Solely for purposes of determining the partnership's basis in the property held by it, the U.S. person shall be treated as having newly acquired an interest in the partnership (for an amount equal to the gain recognized), permitting the partnership to make an optional adjustment to basis pursuant to sections 743 and 754.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limited partnership interest. The transfer by a U.S. person of an interest in a partnership shall not be subject to the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The interest transferred is a limited partnership interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such interest is regularly traded on an established securities market.
Instead, the transfer of such an interest shall be treated in the same manner as a transfer of stock or securities. Thus, the consequences of such a transfer shall be determined under the rules of Sec. 1.367(a)-3. For purposes of this section, a limited partnership interest is an interest as a limited partner in a partnership that is organized under the laws of any State of the United States or the District of Columbia. Whether such an interest is regularly traded on an established securities market shall be determined under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Regularly traded on an established securities market--(1) Established securities market. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), an established securities market is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A foreign national securities exchange which is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by governmental authority; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An over-the-counter market. An over-the-counter market is any market reflected by the existence of an inter-dealer quotation system. An inter-dealer quotation system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates quotations of stock and securities by identified brokers or dealers, other than by quotation sheets which are prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of business and which contain only quotations of such broker or dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regularly traded. A class of interests that is traded on an established securities market is considered to be regularly traded if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such interests. A class of interests

shall be presumed to be regularly traded if the entity has a total of 500 or more interest-holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transfers by trusts and estates--(i) In general. For purposes of section 367(a), a transfer of property by an estate or trust shall be treated as a transfer by the entity itself and not as an indirect transfer by its beneficiaries. Thus, a transfer of property by a foreign trust or estate (as defined in section 7701(a)(31)) is not described in section 367(a)(1), regardless of whether the beneficiaries of the trust or estate are U.S. persons. Similarly, a transfer of property by a domestic trust or estate may be described in section 367(a)(1), regardless of whether the beneficiaries of the trust or estate are foreign persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 367(a), a transfer of property by an estate or trust shall be treated as a transfer by the entity itself and not as an indirect transfer by its beneficiaries. Thus, a transfer of property by a foreign trust or estate (as defined in section 7701(a)(31)) is not described in section 367(a)(1), regardless of whether the beneficiaries of the trust or estate are U.S. persons. Similarly, a transfer of property by a domestic trust or estate may be described in section 367(a)(1), regardless of whether the beneficiaries of the trust or estate are foreign persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grantor trusts. A transfer of a portion or all of the assets of a foreign or domestic trust to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1) is considered a transfer by any U.S. person who is treated as the owner of any such portion or all of the assets of the trust under sections 671 through 679.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Termination of election under section 1504(d). Section 367(A) applies to the constructive reorganization and transfer of property from a domestic corporation to a foreign corporation that occurs upon the termination of an election under section 1504(d), which permits the treatment of certain contiguous country corporations as domestic corporations. The rule of this paragraph (c)(5) is illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Domestic corporation Y previously made a valid election under section 1504(d) to have its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, C, treated as a domestic corporation. On July, 1, 1986, C fails to continue to qualify for the election under section 1504 (d). A constructive reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) occurs. The resulting constructive transfer of assets by ``domestic'' corporation C to Canadian corporation C upon the termination of the election is a transfer of property described in section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Changes in classification of an entity. If a foreign entity is classified as an entity other than an association taxable as a corporation for United States tax purposes, and subsequently a change is made in the governing documents, articles, or agreements of the entity so that the entity is thereafter classified as an association taxable as a corporation, the change in classification is considered a transfer of property to a foreign corporation in connection with an exchange described in section 351. For purposes of section 367(a)(1), the transfer of property is considered as made by the persons determined under the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section with respect to partnerships, and paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii), with respect to trusts and estates, and the rules of such paragraphs apply determining whether a transfer described in section 367(a)(1) has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Contributions to capital. For rules with respect to the treatment of a contribution to the capital of a foreign corporation as a transfer described in section 367(a)(1), see section 367(c)(2) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section and Sec. 1.367(d)-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> United States person. The term United States person includes those persons described in section 7701(a)(30). The term includes a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic partnership, a domestic corporation, and any estate or trust other than a foreign estate or trust. (For definitions of these terms, see section 7701 and regulations thereunder.) For purposes of this section, an individual with respect to whom an election has been made under section 6013 (g) or (h) is considered to be a resident of the United States while such election is in effect. A nonresident alien or a foreign corporation will not be considered a United States person because of its actual or deemed conduct of a trade or business within the United States during a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign corporation. The term foreign corporation has the meaning set forth in section 7701(a)(3) and (5) and Sec. 301.7701-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(a)-1(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property. For purposes of section 367 and regulations thereunder, the term property means any item that constitutes property for purposes of

sections 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intangible property--(i) In general. For purposes of section 367 and regulations thereunder, the term intangible property means knowledge, rights, documents, and any other intangible item within the meaning of section 936(h)(3)(B) that constitutes property for purposes of sections 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, as applicable. Such property shall be treated as intangible property for purposes of section 367 (a) and (d) and the regulations thereunder without regard to whether it is used or developed in the United States or in a foreign country and without regard to whether it is used in manufacturing activities or in marketing activities. A working interest in oil and gas properties shall not be considered to be intangible property for purposes of section 367 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 367 and regulations thereunder, the term intangible property means knowledge, rights, documents, and any other intangible item within the meaning of section 936(h)(3)(B) that constitutes property for purposes of sections 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, as applicable. Such property shall be treated as intangible property for purposes of section 367 (a) and (d) and the regulations thereunder without regard to whether it is used or developed in the United States or in a foreign country and without regard to whether it is used in manufacturing activities or in marketing activities. A working interest in oil and gas properties shall not be considered to be intangible property for purposes of section 367 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Operating intangibles. An operating intangible is any intangible property of a type not ordinarily licensed or otherwise transferred in transactions between unrelated parties for consideration contingent upon the licensee's or transferee's use of the property. Examples of operating intangibles may include long-term purchase or supply contracts, surveys, studies, and customer lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign goodwill or going concern value. Foreign goodwill or going concern value is the residual value of a business operation conducted outside of the United States after all other tangible and intangible assets have been identified and valued. For purposes of section 367 and regulations thereunder the value of the right to use a corporate name in a foreign country shall be treated as foreign goodwill or going concern value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transitional rule for certain marketing intangibles. For transfers occurring after December 31, 1984, and before May 16, 1986, for foreign trademarks, tradenames, brandnames, and similar marketing intangibles developed by a foreign branch shall be treated as foreign goodwill or going concern value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Close of taxable year in certain section 368(a)(1)(F) reorganizations. If a domestic corporation is the transferor corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) after March 30, 1987, in which the acquiring corporation is a foreign corporation, then the taxable year of the transferor corporation shall end with the close of the date of the transfer and the taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall end with the close of the date on which the transferor's taxable year would have ended but for the occurrence of the transfer. With regard to the consequences of the closing of the taxable year, see section 381 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exchanges under sections 354(a) and 361(a) in certain section 368(a)(1)(F) reorganizations. In every reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), where the transferor corporation is a domestic corporation and the acquiring corporation is a foreign corporation, there is considered to exist--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A transfer of assets by the transferor corporation to the acquiring corporation under section 361(a) in exchange for stock of the acquiring corporation and the assumption by the acquiring corporation of the transferor corporation's liabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A distribution of the stock (or stock and securities) of the acquiring corporation by the transferor corporation to the shareholders (or shareholders and security holders) of the transferor corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An exchange by the transferor corporation's shareholders (or shareholders and security holders) of the stock of the transferor corporation for stock (or stock and securities) of the acquiring corporation under section 354(a).

Sec. 1.367(a)-2T  Exception for transfers of property for use in the active conduct of a trade or business (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 367(a)(1) shall not apply to property transferred to a foreign corporation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such property is transferred for use by that corporation in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The U.S. person that transfers the property complies with the reporting requirements of section 6038B and regulations thereunder.
Where these conditions are satisifed, the foreign corporate transferee of the property shall be considered to be a corporation for purposes of determining the extent to which gain or loss is required to be recognized upon the transfer pursuant to section 332, 351, 354 [reserved as to section 355 or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355], 356, or 361. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules concerning the requirement that property be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, while paragraph (c) concerns the application of the requirement where the transferee itself re-transfers the property. In addition, Sec. 1.367(a)-3T provides rules concerning the treatment of stock or securities transferred to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1), and Sec. 1.367(a)-4T provides special rules concerning the treatment of other specified types of property. Finally, Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-5T and 1.367(a)-6T provide rules concerning certain transfers of property that are subject to section 367(a)(1) regardless of whether the property is used in the active conduct of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Active conduct of a trade or business outside the United States--(1) In general. Property qualifies for the exception provided by this section if it is transferred to a foreign corporation for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States. Therefore, to determine whether property is subject to the exception provided by this section, four factual determinations must be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Property qualifies for the exception provided by this section if it is transferred to a foreign corporation for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States. Therefore, to determine whether property is subject to the exception provided by this section, four factual determinations must be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> What is the trade or business of the transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Do the activities of the transferee constitute the active conduct of that trade or business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is the trade or business conducted outside of the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is the transferred property used or held for use in the trade or business?
Rules concerning these four determinations are provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trade or business. Whether the activities of a foreign corporation constitute a trade or business must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. In general, a trade or business is a specific unified group of activities that constitute (or could constitute) an independent economic enterprise carried on for profit. For example, the activities of a foreign selling subsidiary could constitute a trade or business if they could be independently carried on for profit, even though the subsidiary acts exclusively on behalf of, and has operations fully integrated with, its parent corporation. To constitute a trade or business, a group of activities must ordinarily include every operation which forms a part of, or a step in, a process by which an enterprise may earn income or profit. In this regard, one or more of such activities may be carried on by independent contractors under the direct control of the foreign corporation. (However, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section.) The

group of activities must ordinarily include the collection of income and the payment of expenses. If the activities of a foreign corporation do not constitute a trade or business, then the exception provided by this section does not apply, regardless of the level of activities carried on by the corporation. The following activities are not considered to constitute by themselves a trade or business for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any activity giving rise to expenses that would be deductible only under section 212 if the activities were carried on by an individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The holding for one's own account of investments in stock, securities, land, or other property, including casual sales thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Active conduct. Whether a trade or business is actively conducted must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. In general, a corporation actively conducts a trade or business only if the officers and employees of the corporation carry out substantial managerial and operational activities. A corporation may be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business even though incidental activities of the trade or business are carried out on behalf of the corporation by independent contractors. In determining whether the officers and employees of the corporation carry out substantial managerial and operational activities, however, the activities of independent contractors shall be disregarded. On the other hand, the officers and employees of the corporation are considered to include the officers and employees of related entities who are made available to and supervised on a day-to-day basis by, and whose salaries are paid by (or reimbursed to the lending related entity by), the transferee foreign corporation. Whether a trade or business that produces rents or royalties is actively conducted shall be determined under the principles of Sec. 1.954-2(d)(1) (but without regard to whether the rents or royalties are received from an unrelated person). The rule of this paragraph (b)(3) is illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. X, a domestic corporation, and Y, a foreign corporation not related to X, transfer property to Z, a newly formed foreign corporation organized for the purpose of combining the research activities of X and Y. Z contracts all of its operational and research activities to Y for an arm's-length fee. Z's activities do not constitute the active conduct of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Outside of the United States. Whether a foreign corporation conducts a trade or business outside of the United States must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. Generally, the primary managerial and operational activities of the trade or business must be conducted outside the United States and immediately after the transfer the transferred assets must be located outside the United States. Thus, the exception provided by this section would not apply to the transfer of the assets of a domestic business to a foreign corporation if the domestic business continued to operate in the United States after the transfer. In such a case, the primary operational activities of the business would continue to be conducted in the United States. Moreover, the transferred assets would be located in the United States. However, it is not necessary that every item of property transferred be used outside of the United States. As long as the primary managerial and operational activities of the trade or business are conducted outside of the United States and substantially all of the transferred assets are located outside the United States, incidental items of transferred property located in the United States may be considered to have been transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use in the trade or business. Whether property is used or held for use in a trade or business must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. In general, property is used or held for use in a foreign corporation's trade or business if it is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct of the trade or business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise held in a direct relationship to the trade or business. Property is considered held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if it is held to meet the present needs of that

trade or business and not its anticipated future needs.
Thus, property will not be considered to be held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if it is held for the purpose of providing for future diversification into a new trade or business, future expansion of trade or business activities, future plant replacement, or future business contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Property transferred by transferee corporation--(1) General rule. If a foreign corporation receives property in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1) and as part of the same transaction transfers the property to another person, then the exception provided by this section shall not apply to the initial transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a subsequent transfer within six months of the initial transfer shall be considered to be part of the same transaction, and a subsequent transfer more than six months after the initial transfer may be considered to be part of the same transaction upon the application of step-transaction principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If a foreign corporation receives property in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1) and as part of the same transaction transfers the property to another person, then the exception provided by this section shall not apply to the initial transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a subsequent transfer within six months of the initial transfer shall be considered to be part of the same transaction, and a subsequent transfer more than six months after the initial transfer may be considered to be part of the same transaction upon the application of step-transaction principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the active conduct exception provided by this section shall apply to the initial transfer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The initial transfer is followed by one or more subsequent transfers described in section 351 or 721; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each subsequent transferee is either a partnership in which the preceding transferor is a general partner or a corporation in which the preceding transferor owns common stock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The ultimate transferee uses the property in the active conduct of a trade or business outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transitional rule. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, property shall be considered to have been transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The property was transferred after December 31, 1984, and before June 16, 1986;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The property was, or would have been, considered to be transferred for use by the transferee foreign corporation in the active conduct, in any foreign country, or a trade or business, under the principles of section 3.02(1) of Revenue Procedure 68-23, 1968-1 C.B. 821; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Based on all of the facts and circumstances, it was, or would have been, determined under section 2.02 of Revenue Procedure 68-23 that tax avoidance was not one of the principal purposes of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance see Sec. 1.367(a)-2(e).

Sec. 1.367(a)-3  Treatment of transfers of stock or securities to foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Overview. This section provides rules concerning the transfer of stock or securities by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1). In general, a transfer of stock or securities (including an indirect stock transfer described in paragraph (d) of this section) by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation that is described in section 351, 354 (including a section 354 exchange pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B)), 356, or section 361(a) or (b) is subject to section 367(a)(1). Therefore, gain is recognized on such a transfer unless one of the exceptions set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding general exceptions for certain exchanges of stock or securities), paragraph (b) of this section (regarding transfers of foreign stock or securities), paragraph (c) of this section (regarding transfers of domestic stock or securities), or paragraph (e) of this section (regarding transfers of stock or securities in a section 361 exchange) applies to the transfer. For rules applicable when, pursuant to section 304(a)(1), a U.S. person is treated as transferring stock of a domestic or foreign corporation to a foreign corporation in exchange for stock of such foreign corporation in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies, see Sec. 1.367(a)-9T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview. This section provides rules concerning the transfer of stock or securities by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1). In general, a transfer of stock or securities (including an indirect stock transfer described in paragraph (d) of this section) by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation that is described in section 351, 354 (including a section 354 exchange pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B)), 356, or section 361(a) or (b) is subject to section 367(a)(1). Therefore, gain is recognized on such a transfer unless one of the exceptions set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding general exceptions for certain exchanges of stock or securities), paragraph (b) of this section (regarding transfers of foreign stock or securities), paragraph (c) of this section (regarding transfers of domestic stock or securities), or paragraph (e) of this section (regarding transfers of stock or securities in a section 361 exchange) applies to the transfer. For rules applicable when, pursuant to section 304(a)(1), a U.S. person is treated as transferring stock of a domestic or foreign corporation to a foreign corporation in exchange for stock of such foreign corporation in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies, see Sec. 1.367(a)-9T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions for certain exchanges of stock or securities. Unless otherwise provided, the following exchanges are not subject to section 367(a)(1) and therefore gain is not recognized under section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 368(a)(1)(E) reorganizations. In an exchange under section 354 or 356, a U.S. person exchanges stock or securities of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain section 368(a)(1) asset reorganizations. In an exchange under section 354 or 356, a U.S. person exchanges stock or securities of a domestic or foreign corporation pursuant to an asset reorganization that is not treated as an indirect stock transfer under paragraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(3) Example 16 of this section. For purposes of this section, an asset reorganization is defined as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) involving a transfer of property under section 361.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain reorganizations described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). If, in an exchange described in section 361, a domestic merging corporation transfers stock of a controlling corporation to a foreign surviving corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E), the stock of the controlling corporation transferred in such section 361 exchange is not subject to section 367(a)(1) if the stock of the controlling corporation is provided to the merging corporation by the controlling corporation pursuant to the plan of reorganization. However, a section 361 exchange of other property, including stock of the controlling corporation not provided by the controlling corporation pursuant to the plan of reorganization, by the domestic merging corporation to the foreign surviving corporation pursuant to such a reorganization is described in section 367(a)(1) and therefore subject to section 367(a)(1) unless an exception to section 367(a)(1) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain triangular reorganizations described in Sec. 1.367(b)-10.

The condition specified in this paragraph (iv) is that the amount of gain in the T stock or securities that would otherwise be recognized under section 367(a)(1) (without regard to any exceptions thereto) pursuant to the indirect stock transfer rules of paragraph (d) of this section is less than the sum of the amount of the deemed distribution under Sec. 1.367(b)-10 treated as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) and the amount of such deemed distribution treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3).

FC2, also a foreign corporation, is owned entirely by foreign individuals who are not related to DC or FC1. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC2 acquires all of the stock of FC1 from DC in exchange for 20 percent of the voting stock of FC2.

Under the provisions of this paragraph (b), if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement, DC is required to recognize in the year of the transfer the $50 of gain that it realized upon the transfer, $30 of which will be treated as a dividend under section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Result with gain recognition agreement. If DC enters into a gain recognition agreement under Sec. 1.367(a)-8 with respect to the transfer of FC1 stock, the exchange will also be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder to the extent that it is not subject to tax under section 367(a)(1). In such case, DC will be required to recognize the section 1248 amount of $30 on the exchange of FC1 for FC2 stock. See Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b). The deemed dividend of $30 recognized by DC will increase its basis in the FC1 stock exchanged in the transaction and, therefore, the basis of the FC2 stock received in the transaction. The remaining gain of $20 realized by DC (otherwise recognizable under section 367(a)) in the exchange of FC1 stock will not be recognized if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer. (The result would be unchanged if, for example, the exchange of FC1 stock for FC2 stock qualified as a section 351 exchange, or as an exchange described in both sections 351 and 368(a)(1)(B).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfers of stock or securities of domestic corporations--(1) General rule.

This paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FC, a foreign corporation, issues 51 percent of its stock to the shareholders of S, a domestic corporation, in exchange for their S stock, in a transaction described in section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all shareholders of S who receive stock of FC in the exchange are presumed to be U.S. persons. Unless this ownership presumption is rebutted, the condition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section will not be satisfied, and the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will not be available. As a result, all U.S. persons that transferred S stock will recognize gain on the exchange. To rebut the ownership presumption, S must comply with the reporting requirements contained in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, obtaining ownership statements (described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section) from a sufficient number of non-U.S. persons who received FC stock in the exchange to demonstrate that the amount of FC stock received by U.S. persons in the exchange does not exceed 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FC issues only 40 percent of its stock to the shareholders of S in the exchange. FC satisfies the active trade or business test of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. A, a U.S. person, owns 10 percent of S's stock immediately before the transfer. All other shareholders of S own less than five percent of its stock. None of S's officers or directors owns any stock in FC immediately after the transfer. A will own 15 percent of the stock of FC immediately after the transfer, 4 percent received in the exchange, and the balance being stock in FC that A owned prior to and independent of the transaction. No S shareholder besides A owns five percent or more of FC immediately after the transfer. The reporting requirements under paragraph (c)(6) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The condition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied because, even after application of the presumption in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, U.S. transferors could not receive more than 50 percent of FC's stock in the transaction. There is no control group because five-percent target shareholders and officers and directors of S do not, in the aggregate, own more than 50 percent of the stock of FC immediately after the transfer (A, the sole five-percent target shareholder, owns 15 percent of the stock of FC immediately after the transfer, and no officers or directors of S own any stock of FC immediately after the transfer). Therefore, the condition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is satisfied. The facts assume that the condition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is satisfied. Thus, U.S. persons that are not five-percent transferee shareholders will not recognize gain on the exchange of S shares for FC shares. A, a five-percent transferee shareholder, will not be required to include in income any gain realized on the exchange in the year of the transfer if he files a 5-year gain recognition agreement (GRA) and complies with section 6038B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that B, another U.S. person, is a 5-percent target shareholder, owning 25 percent of S's stock immediately before the transfer. B owns 40 percent of the stock of FC immediately after the transfer, 10 percent received in the exchange, and the balance being stock in FC that B owned prior to and independent of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A control group exists because A and B, each a five-percent target shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, together own more than 50 percent of FC immediately after the transfer (counting both stock received in the exchange and stock owned prior to and independent of the exchange). As a result, the condition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not satisfied, and all U.S. persons (not merely A and B) who transferred S stock will recognize gain on the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that B is a partnership (domestic or foreign) that has five equal partners, only two of whom, X and Y, are U.S. persons. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, X and Y are treated as the owners and transferors of 5 percent each of the S stock owned and transferred by B and as owners of 8 percent each of the FC stock owned by B immediately after the transfer. U.S. persons that are five-percent target shareholders thus own a total of 31 percent of the stock of FC immediately after the transfer (A's 15 percent, plus X's 8 percent, plus Y's 8 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because no control group exists, the condition in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is satisfied. The conditions in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (iv) of this section also are satisfied. Thus, U.S. persons that are not five-percent transferee shareholders will not recognize gain on the exchange of S shares for FC shares. A, X, and Y, each a five-percent transferee shareholder, will not be required to include in income in the year of the transfer any gain realized on the exchange if they file 5-year GRAs and comply with section 6038B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Effective date.

The required statement shall contain a certification that, if the foreign acquiring corporation disposes of any stock of the domestic controlled corporation in a transaction described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, the domestic acquired corporation shall recognize gain as described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(E) of this section. The domestic acquired corporation (or the foreign acquiring corporation on behalf of the domestic acquired corporation) shall file a U.S. income tax return (or an amended U.S. tax return, as the case may be) for the year of the transfer reporting such gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Gain recognition transaction. (1) A transaction described in this paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D) is one where a principal purpose of the transfer by the domestic acquired corporation is the avoidance of U.S. tax that would have been imposed on the domestic acquired corporation on the disposition of the re-transferred assets. A transfer may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D)(1) of this section, a transaction is deemed to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance if the foreign acquiring corporation disposes of any stock of the domestic controlled corporation (whether in a recognition or non-recognition transaction) within 2 years of the transfer described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section. The rule in this paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D)(2) shall not apply if the domestic acquired corporation (or the foreign acquiring corporation on behalf of the domestic acquired corporation) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the avoidance of U.S. tax was not a principal purpose of the transaction. For this purpose, a disposition by the foreign acquiring corporation of stock of the domestic controlled corporation more than 5 years after completion of the transfer described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is deemed to not have a principal purpose of tax avoidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Amount of gain recognized and other matters. (1) In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(E), the domestic acquired corporation shall be treated as if, immediately prior to the transfer described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, it transferred the re-transferred assets, including any intangible assets, directly to a domestic corporation in exchange for stock of such domestic corporation in a transaction that is treated as a section 351 exchange, and immediately sold such stock to an unrelated party for its fair market value in a sale in which it shall recognize gain, if any (but not loss). Any gain recognized by the domestic acquired corporation pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(E) will increase the basis that the foreign acquiring corporation has in the stock of the domestic controlled corporation immediately before the transaction described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, but will not increase the basis of the re-transferred assets held by the domestic controlled corporation. Section 1.367(d)-1T(g)(6) shall not apply with respect to any intangible property included in the re-transferred assets described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If additional tax is required to be paid as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, then interest must be paid on that amount at rates determined under section 6621 with respect to the period between the date prescribed for filing the domestic acquired corporation's income tax return for the year of the transfer and the date on which the additional tax for that year is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Examples.

A, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of W, also a domestic corporation. A and W file a consolidated Federal income tax return. A does not own any stock in F (applying the attribution rules of section 318, as modified by section 958(b)).

Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the reorganization is subject to the indirect stock transfer rules. F is treated as the transferee foreign corporation, and Newco is treated as the transferred corporation. Provided that the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, including the requirement that A enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement as described in Sec. 1.367(a)-8, A's exchange of W stock for F stock under section 354 will not be subject to section 367(a)(1). If F disposes (within the meaning of Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(1)) of all (or a portion) of Newco's stock within the five-year term of the agreement (and A has not made a valid election under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(c)(2)(vi)), A is required to file an amended return for the year of the transfer and include in income, with interest, the gain realized but not recognized on the initial section 354 exchange. If A has made a valid election under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(c)(2)(vi) to include the amount subject to the gain recognition agreement in the year of the triggering event, A would instead include the gain on its tax return for the taxable year that includes the triggering event, together with interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A is owned by P, a domestic corporation, and for the taxable year in which the transaction occurred, P, A and W filed a consolidated Federal income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Even though A is the U.S. transferor, P is required under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(d)(3) and (e)(1)(i) to enter into the gain recognition agreement and comply with the requirements under Sec. 1.367(a)-8. If A leaves the P group, the gain recognition agreement would be triggered pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(5), unless the exception provided under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(k)(10) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Newco merges into W and Newco receives stock of W which it distributes to F in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). Pursuant to the reorganization, A receives 40 percent of the stock of F in an exchange described in section 354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The consequences of the transfer are similar to those described in Example 1. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, A is considered to have transferred its W stock to F pursuant to the indirect stock transfer rules. F is treated as the transferee foreign corporation, and W is treated as the transferred corporation. Provided that the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, including the requirement that A enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement as described in Sec. 1.367(a)-8, A's exchange of W stock for F stock under section 354 will not be subject to section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A receives 55 percent of either the total voting power or the total value of the stock of F in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. A is required to include in income in the year of the exchange the amount of gain realized on such exchange. See paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. If A fails to include the income on its timely-filed return, A will also be liable for the penalty under

section 6038B (together with interest and other applicable penalties) unless A's failure to include the income is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, during the third year of the gain recognition agreement, Newco disposes of substantially all (as described inSec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(2)(i)) of the assets described in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section for cash and recognizes currently all of the gain realized on the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(2), the gain recognition agreement is generally triggered when the transferred corporation disposes of substantially all of its assets. However, under the special rule contained in Sec. 1.367(a)-8(o)(4), because A owned an amount of stock in W described in section 1504(a)(2) immediately before the transaction, because A and W filed a consolidated Federal income tax return prior to the transaction, and Newco, the transferred corporation, is a domestic corporation, the gain recognition agreement is terminated and has no further effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all the stock of S, a domestic corporation. U, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, also a domestic corporation. U does not own any of the stock of F (applying the attribution rules of section 318, as modified by section 958(b)). In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, S acquires all the stock of Y, and U receives 10% of the voting stock of F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. U's exchange of Y stock for F stock will not be subject to section 367(a)(1), provided that all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) are satisfied, including the requirement that U enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement. For purposes of this section, F is treated as the transferee foreign corporation and Y is treated as the transferred corporation. See paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(9), the gain recognition agreement would be triggered if F sold all or a portion of the stock of S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that F is a domestic corporation and S is a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. U's exchange of Y stock for stock of F, a domestic corporation in control of S, the foreign acquiring corporation, is treated as an indirect transfer of Y stock to a foreign corporation under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section. U's exchange of Y stock for F stock will not be subject to section 367(a)(1) provided that all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, including the requirement that U enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement. In satisfying the 50 percent or less ownership requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, U's indirect ownership of S stock (through its direct ownership of F) will determine whether the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied and will be taken into account in determining whether the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is satisfied. See paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. For purposes of this section, S is treated as the transferee foreign corporation (see paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section). If Y sold substantially all of its assets (within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(C)), the gain recognition agreement would be terminated because U owned an amount of stock in Y described in section 1504(a)(2) immediately before the transaction and Y is a domestic corporation. See Sec. 1.367(a)-8(o)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of R, a domestic corporation that operates an historical business. V, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Z, also a domestic corporation. V does not own any of the stock of F (applying the attribution rules of section 318 as modified by section 958(b)). In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) (and paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section), R acquires all of the assets of Z, and V receives 30% of the voting stock of F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The consequences of the transfer are similar to those described in Example 1; V is required to enter into a 5-year gain recognition agreement under Sec. 1.367(a)-8 to secure nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a). Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, F is treated as the transferee foreign corporation and R is treated as the transferred corporation. In determining whether, in a later transaction, R has disposed of substantially all of its assets under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(2)(i), see paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that the transaction is structured as a section 368(a)(1)(C) reorganization with Z transferring its assets to F, followed by a controlled asset transfer, and R is a foreign corporation. The following additional facts are present. Z has 3 businesses: Business A with a basis of $10 and a value of $50, Business B with a basis of $10 and a value of $40, and Business C with a basis of $10 and a value of $30. V and Z file a consolidated Federal income tax return and V has a basis of $30 in the Z stock, which has a value of $120. Assume that Businesses A and B consist solely of assets that will satisfy the section 367(a)(3) active trade or business exception; none of Business C's assets will satisfy the

exception. Z transfers all 3 businesses to F in exchange for 30 percent of the F stock, which Z distributes to V pursuant to a section 368(a)(1)(C) reorganization. F then contributes Businesses B and C to R in a controlled asset transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The transfer of the Business A assets by Z to F does not constitute an indirect stock transfer under paragraph (d) of this section, and, subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the Business A assets qualify for the section 367(a)(3) active trade or business exception and are not subject to section 367(a)(1). The transfer of the Business B and C assets by Z to F must first be tested under sections 367(a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(5). Z recognizes $20 of gain on the outbound transfer of the Business C assets, as those assets do not qualify for an exception to section 367(a)(1). Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the Business B assets qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). Pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(vii)(A)(2) of this section, V is deemed to transfer the stock of a foreign corporation to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. V must enter into the gain recognition agreement in the amount of $30 to preserve Z's nonrecognition treatment with respect to its transfer of Business B assets. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, F is the transferee foreign corporation and R is the transferred corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6B.

[Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(d)(3), Example 6C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that, during the fourth year of the gain recognition agreement, R transfers substantially all of the assets received from Z to K, a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of R, in an exchange described in section 351.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The disposition by R, the transferred corporation, of substantially all of its assets would terminate the gain recognition agreement if the assets were disposed of in a taxable transaction because V owned an amount of stock in Z described in section 1504(a)(2) immediately before the transaction, and R is a domestic corporation. See Sec. 1.367(a)-8(o)(4). Because the assets were transferred in an exchange to which section 351 applies, such transfer does not trigger the gain recognition agreement if V complies with the requirements contained in Sec. 1.367(a)-8(k)(4). See also paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. To determine whether substantially all of the assets are disposed of, any assets of Z that were transferred by Z to R and then contributed by R to K are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 7 except that K is a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. This transfer of assets by R to K must be analyzed to determine its effect upon the gain recognition agreement, and such transfer is also an outbound transfer of assets that is taxable under section 367(a)(1) unless the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) applies. If the transfer is fully taxable under section 367(a)(1), the transfer is treated as if the transferred company, R, sold substantially all of its assets. Thus, the gain recognition agreement would terminate because V owned an amount of stock in Z described in section 1504(a)(2) immediately before the transaction, and R is a domestic corporation. See Sec. 1.367(a)-8(o)(4). If each asset transferred qualifies for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder (which require, under Sec. 1.367(a)-2T(a)(2), the transferor to comply with the reporting requirements under section 6038B), the result is the same as in Example 7. If a portion of the assets transferred qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a)(3) and a portion are taxable under section 367(a)(1) (but such portion does not result in the disposition of substantially all of the assets), the gain recognition agreement will not be triggered if such information is reported as required under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(g) and V satisfies the requirements contained in Sec. 1.367(a)-8(k)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 6, except that R is a foreign corporation and V and Z file a consolidated return for Federal income tax purposes. The properties of Z consist of Business A assets, with an adjusted basis of $50 and fair market value of $90, and Business B assets, with an adjusted basis of $50 and a fair market value of $110. Assume that the Business A assets do not qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3), but that the Business B assets do qualify for the exception. V's basis in the Z stock is $100, and the value of such stock is $200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (d)(2)(vi), the assets of Businesses A and B that are transferred to R must be tested under sections 367(a)(3) and (a)(5) prior to consideration of the indirect stock transfer rules of this paragraph (d). Thus, Z must recognize $40 of income under section 367(a)(1) on the outbound transfer of Business A assets. Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the Business B assets qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). Under

Sec. 1.1502-32, because V and Z file a consolidated return, V's basis in its Z stock increases from $100 to $140 as a result of Z's $40 gain. Pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(vii)(A)(1) of this section, V is deemed to transfer the stock of a foreign corporation to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, and therefore must enter into a gain recognition agreement in the amount of $60 (the gain realized but not recognized by V in the stock of Z after the $40 basis adjustment). If F sells a portion of its stock in R during the term of the agreement, V will be required to recognize a portion of the $60 gain subject to the agreement. To determine whether R disposes of substantially all of its assets (under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(2)(i)), only the Business B assets will be considered (because the transfer of the Business A assets was taxable to Z under section 367). See paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that V and Z do not file consolidated income tax returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Z would still recognize $40 of gain on the transfer of its Business A assets, and the Business B assets would still qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). However, V's basis in its stock of Z would not be increased by the amount of Z's gain. V's indirect transfer of stock will be taxable unless V enters into a gain recognition agreement (as described in Sec. 1.367(a)-8) for the $100 of gain realized but not recognized with respect to the stock of Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that V is an individual U.S. citizen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(b), the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) does not apply to Z's transfer of assets to R. Thus, Z's transfer of assets to R would be fully taxable under section 367(a)(1). Z would recognize $100 of income. V's basis in its stock of Z is not increased by this amount. V is taxable with respect to its indirect transfer of its Z stock unless V enters into a gain recognition agreement in the amount of the $100, the gain realized but not recognized with respect to its Z stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that V is a nonresident alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(b), the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) does not apply to Z's transfer of assets to R. Thus, Z has $100 of gain with respect to the Business A and B assets. Because V is a nonresident alien, however, V is not subject to section 367(a) with respect to its indirect transfer of Z stock.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(d)(3), Example 9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that R acquires all of the assets of Z in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). Pursuant to the reorganization, V receives 30 percent of the stock of F in a section 354 exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The consequences of the transaction are similar to those in Example 8. The assets of Businesses A and B that are transferred to R must be tested under section 367(a) and (d) prior to the consideration of the indirect stock transfer rules of this paragraph (d). Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the Business B assets qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). Because the Business A assets do not qualify for the exception, Z must recognize $40 of gain under section 367(a) on the transfer of Business A assets to R. Further, because V and Z file a consolidated return, V's basis in the stock of Z is increased from $100 to $140 as a result of Z's $40 gain. Pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(vii)(A)(1) of this section, V is deemed to transfer the stock of a foreign corporation to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. V's indirect transfer of foreign stock will be taxable under section 367(a) unless V enters into a gain recognition agreement in the amount of $60 ($200 value of Z stock less $140 adjusted basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all the stock of D, a domestic corporation. V, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of Z, a foreign corporation. V has a basis of $100 in the stock of Z which has a fair market value of $200. D is an operating corporation with assets valued at $100 with a basis of $60. In a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E), D merges into Z, and V exchanges its Z stock for 55 percent of the outstanding F stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, V is treated as indirectly transferring Z stock to F. V must recognize gain on its indirect transfer of Z stock to F under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if V does not enter into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the indirect stock transfer in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if V enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the indirect stock transfer, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations pursuant to such section as well as section

367(a). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b), however, no income inclusion is required because, immediately after the exchange, F and Z are controlled foreign corporations with respect to which V is a section 1248 shareholder. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferee foreign corporation is F, and the transferred corporation is Z (the acquiring corporation). If F disposes (within the meaning of Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(1)) of all (or a portion) of Z stock within the term of the gain recognition agreement, V must either file an amended return for the year of the indirect stock transfer and include in income, with interest, the gain realized but not recognized on the initial exchange or if a valid election under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(c)(2)(vi) was made, currently recognize the gain and pay the related interest. Under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B) of this section, to determine whether, for purposes of the gain recognition agreement, Z (the transferred corporation) disposes of substantially all of its assets, only the assets held by Z immediately before the transaction are taken into account. Because D is wholly owned by F, a foreign corporation, the control requirement of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(1) cannot be satisfied. Therefore, section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(b) preclude the application of the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) to any property transferred by D to Z. Thus, under section 367(a)(1), D must recognize the gross amount of gain in each asset transferred to Z, or $40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of O, also a foreign corporation. D, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of E, also a domestic corporation, which owns all of the stock of N, also a domestic corporation. Prior to the transactions described in this Example 12, D, E and N filed a consolidated income tax return. D has a basis of $100 in the stock of E, which has a fair market value of $160. The N stock has a fair market value of $100, and E has a basis of $60 in such stock. In addition to the stock of N, E owns the assets of Business X. The assets of Business X have a fair market value of $60, and E has a basis of $50 in such assets. Assume that the Business X assets qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a)(3). D does not own any stock in F (applying the attribution rules of section 318 as modified by section 958(b)). In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) and paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, O acquires all of the assets of E, and D exchanges its stock in E for 40% of the voting stock of F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. E's transfer of its assets, including the N stock, must be tested under the general rules of section 367(a) before consideration of D's indirect transfer of the stock of E. Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) applies to E's transfer of Business X assets. E's transfer of its N stock could qualify for nonrecognition treatment if D satisfies the requirements in Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(3). O is the transferee foreign corporation; N is the transferred corporation. Pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(vii)(A)(1) of this section, D is deemed to transfer the stock of a foreign corporation to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, and therefore may enter into a gain recognition agreement for such indirect stock transfer as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 1.367(a)-8. As to this transfer, F is the transferee foreign corporation; O is the transferred corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. D, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of X, a controlled foreign corporation that operates an historical business, which owns all the stock of Y, a controlled foreign corporation that also operates an historical business. The properties of D consist of Business A assets, with an adjusted basis of $50 and a fair market value of $90, and Business B assets, with an adjusted basis of $50 and a fair market value of $110. Assume that the Business B assets qualify for the exception under section 367(a)(3) and Sec. 1.367(a)-2T(c)(2), but that the Business A assets do not qualify for the exception. In an exchange described in section 351, D transfers the assets of Businesses A and B to X, and, in connection with the same transaction, X transfers the assets of Business B to Y in another exchange described in section 351.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section, this transaction is treated as an indirect stock transfer for purposes of section 367(a), but the transaction is not recharacterized for purposes of section 367(b). Moreover, under paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, the assets of Businesses A and B that are transferred to X must be tested under section 367(a)(3). The Business A assets, which were not transferred to Y, are subject to the general rules of section 367(a), and not the indirect stock transfer rules described in this paragraph (d). D must recognize $40 of income on the outbound transfer of Business A assets. The transfer of the Business B assets is subject to both the asset transfer rules (under section 367(a)(3)) and the indirect stock transfer rules of this paragraph (d) and Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Thus, D's transfer of the Business B assets will not be subject to section 367(a)(1) if D enters into a five-year gain recognition agreement with respect to the stock of Y. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, X will be treated as the transferee foreign corporation and Y will be treated as the transferred corporation for purposes of applying the terms of the agreement. If X sells all or a portion

of the stock of Y during the term of the agreement, D will be required to recognize a proportionate amount of the $60 gain that was realized by D on the initial transfer of the Business B assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 13, except that Y is a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. As in Example 13, D must recognize $40 of income on the outbound transfer of the Business A assets. Although the Business B assets qualify for the exception under section 367(a)(3) (and end up in U.S. corporate solution, in Y), the $60 of gain realized on the Business B assets is nevertheless taxable under paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1)(vi) of this section because the transaction is considered to be a transfer by D of stock of a domestic corporation, Y, in which D receives more than 50 percent of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation, X. A gain recognition agreement is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. Concurrent application of indirect stock transfer rules and section 367(b). (i) Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of Newco, which is also a foreign corporation. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of S, a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a). P's basis in the stock of S is $50 and the value of S is $100. The section 1248 amount with respect to S stock is $30. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) (and paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section), Newco acquires all of the properties of S, and P exchanges its stock in S for 49 percent of the stock of F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. P's exchange of S stock for F stock under section 354 will be taxable under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if P fails to enter into a 5-year gain recognition agreement in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if P enters into a gain recognition agreement, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder as well as section 367(a). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b), P must recognize the section 1248 amount of $30 because P exchanged stock of a controlled foreign corporation, S, for stock of a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, F. The indirect stock transfer rules do not apply with respect to section 367(b). The deemed dividend of $30 recognized by P will increase P's basis in the F stock received in the transaction, and F's basis in the Newco stock. Thus, the amount of the gain recognition agreement is $20 ($50 gain realized on the transfer less the $30 inclusion under section 367(b)). Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, F is treated as the transferee foreign corporation and Newco is the transferred corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 14, except that P receives 51 percent of the stock of F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Assuming Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b) does not apply, there is no income inclusion under section 367(b), and the amount of the gain recognition agreement is $50.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Concurrent application of indirect stock transfer rules and section 367(b). (i) Facts. F, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of Newco, a domestic corporation. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FC, a foreign corporation. P's basis in the stock of FC is $50 and the value of FC stock is $100. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock held by P is $60. See Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d). In a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) (and paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section), Newco acquires all of the properties of FC, and P exchanges its stock in FC for 20 percent of the stock in F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. P's section 354 exchange is considered an indirect stock transfer under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Further, because the assets of FC were acquired by Newco, a domestic corporation, in an asset reorganization, the transaction is within Sec. 1.367(b)-3(a) and (b). Because the transaction is subject to Sec. 1.367(b)-3 and the indirect stock rules of paragraph (d) of this section, and because the all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock exchanged by P ($60) is greater than the gain in such stock subject to section 367(a) ($50), the section 367(b) rules (and not the section 367(a) rules) apply to the exchange. See Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(2)(i)(B). Under the rules of section 367(b), P must include in income the all earnings and profits amount of $60 with respect to its FC stock. See Sec. 1.367(b)-3. Alternatively, if P's all earnings and profits amount with respect to its FC stock were $30 (which is less than the gain in such stock subject to section 367(a) ($50)), section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder would not apply if there is gain recognition under section 367(a). Thus, if P failed to enter into a 5-year gain recognition agreement in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-8, then P would recognize $50 of gain under section 367(a) and there would be no income inclusion under section 367(b). If, instead, P enters into a 5-year gain recognition agreement under Sec. 1.367(a)-8, thereby avoiding immediate gain recognition on the entire $50 of section 367(a) gain, P is required to include in income the all earnings and profits amount of $30. In such a case, P will adjust its basis in the FC stock pursuant to Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) and enter into a gain recognition agreement in the amount of $20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3), Example 6A of this section, except that R is a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. As in paragraph (d)(3) Example 6A of this section, the outbound transfer of the Business A assets to F is not affected by the rules of Sec. 1.367-3(d) and is subject to the general rules under section 367. Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), the Business A assets qualify for the section 367(a)(3) active trade or business exception and are not subject to section 367(a)(1). The Business B and C assets are part of an indirect stock transfer under Sec. 1.367-3(d), but must first be tested under section 367(a) and (d). The Business B assets qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3); the Business C assets do not. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B)(1) of this section, the Business B and C assets are not subject to section 367(a) or (d), provided that the basis of the Business B and C assets in the hands of R is not greater than the basis of the assets in the hands of Z, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(6) of this section are satisfied, and Z attaches a statement described in paragraphs (d)(2)(vi)(C) of this section to its U.S. income tax return for the taxable year of the transfer. V also is deemed to make an indirect transfer of Z stock under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent the assets are transferred to R. To preserve non-recognition treatment, and assuming the other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied, V must enter into a gain recognition agreement in the amount of $50, which equals the aggregate gain in the Business B and C assets, because the transfer of those assets by Z was not taxable under section 367(a)(1) and constitute an indirect stock transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6B, except that Z is owned by U.S. individuals, none of whom qualify as five-percent target shareholders with respect to Z within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. The following additional facts are present. No U.S. persons that are either officers or directors of Z own any stock of F immediately after the transfer. F is engaged in an active trade or business outside the United States that satisfies the test set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The Business A assets transferred to F are not re-transferred to R and therefore Z's transfer of these assets is not subject to the rules of paragraph (d) of this section. However, gain must be recognized on the transfer of those assets under section 367(a)(1) because the section 367(a)(3) active trade or business exception is inapplicable pursuant to section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(b). The Business B and C assets are part of an indirect stock transfer under paragraph (d) of this section, but must first be tested with respect to Z under section 367(a) and (d), as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section. The transfer of the Business B assets (which otherwise would satisfy the section 367(a)(3) active trade or business exception) generally is subject to section 367(a)(1) pursuant to section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(b). The transfer of the Business C assets generally is subject to section 367(a)(1) because these assets do not qualify for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, the transfer of the Business B and C assets is not subject to sections 367(a)(1) and (d), provided the basis of the Business B and C assets in the hands of R is no greater than the basis in the hands of Z and certain other requirements are satisfied. Z may avoid immediate gain recognition under section 367(a) and (d) on the transfers of the Business B and Business C assets to F if, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, the indirect transfer of Z stock satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(6) of this section, and Z attaches a statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(C) of this section to its U.S. income tax return for the taxable year of the transfer. In general, the statement must contain a certification that, if F disposes of the stock of R (in a recognition or nonrecognition transaction) and a principal purpose of the transfer is the avoidance of U.S. tax that would have been

imposed on Z on the disposition of the Business B and C assets transferred to R, then Z (or F on behalf of Z) will file a return (or amended return as the case may be) recognizing gain ($50), as if, immediately prior to the reorganization, Z transferred the Business B and C assets to a domestic corporation in exchange for stock in a transaction treated as a section 351 exchange and immediately sold such stock to an unrelated party for its fair market value. A transaction is deemed to have a principal purpose of U.S. tax avoidance if F disposes of R stock within two years of the transfer, unless Z (or F on behalf of Z) can rebut the presumption to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. See paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(D)(2) of this section. With respect to the indirect transfer of Z stock, assume the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iv) of this section are satisfied. Thus, assuming Z attaches the statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(C) of this section to its U.S. income tax return and satisfies the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the transfer of Business B and C assets is not subject to immediate gain recognition under section 367(a) or (d).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7 through Example 8(C).

The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3) Example 8 of this section, except that R transfers the Business A assets to M, a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of R, in a controlled asset transfer. In addition, V's basis in its Z stock is $90.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, sections 367(a) and (d) do not apply to Z's transfer of the Business A assets to R if M's basis in the Business A assets is not greater than the basis of the assets in the hands of Z, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(6) of this section are satisfied, and Z includes a statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(C) of this section with its U.S. income tax return for the taxable year of the transfer. Subject to the conditions and requirements of section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c), Z's transfer of the Business B assets to R (which are not re-transferred to M) qualifies for the active trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3). Pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(vii)(A)(1) of this section, V is generally deemed to transfer the stock of a foreign corporation to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, including the requirement that V enter into a gain recognition agreement and comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.367(a)-8. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B), paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent of the transfer of business A assets by R to M, a domestic corporation. As a result, to the extent of the business A assets transferred by R to M, V is deemed to transfer the stock of Z (a domestic corporation) to F in a section 354 exchange subject to the rules of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Thus, with respect to V's indirect transfer of stock of a domestic corporation to F, such transfer is not subject to gain recognition under section 367(a)(1) if the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied, including the requirement that V enter into a gain recognition agreement (separate from the gain recognition agreement described above with respect to the deemed transfer of stock of a foreign corporation to F) and comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferee foreign corporation is F and the transferred corporation is R (with respect to the transfer of stock of a foreign corporation) and M (with respect to the transfer of stock of a domestic corporation). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, a disposition by F of the stock of R would trigger both gain recognition agreements. In addition, a disposition by R of the stock of M would trigger the gain recognition agreement filed with respect to the transfer of the stock of a domestic corporation. To determine whether there is a triggering event under Sec. 1.367(a)-8(j)(2)(i) for the gain recognition agreement filed with respect to the transfer of stock of the domestic corporation, the Business A assets in M must be considered. To determine whether there is such a triggering event for the gain recognition agreement filed with respect to the transfer of stock of the foreign corporation, the Business B assets in R must be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10 through Example 16.

US1, US2, and X own 80%, 5%, and 15%, respectively, of the stock of UST with a fair market value of $160x, $10x, and $30x, respectively. UST has two assets, Asset A and 100% of the stock of CFC1. UST has no liabilities. Asset A has a $150x basis and $100x fair market value (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(3)), and the CFC1 stock has a $0x basis and $100x fair market value.

In this case, the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are satisfied. First, the requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied because the control requirement of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(1) is satisfied, and a stated assumption is that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) through 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) will be satisfied. The control requirement is

satisfied because US1 and US2, each a control group member, own in the aggregate 85% of the stock of UST immediately before the reorganization.

See paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section.

See paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Accordingly, UST does not recognize the $100x of gain realized in the CFC1 stock pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In order to meet the requirements of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i), UST must recognize gain equal to the portion of the inside gain (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(5)) attributable to non-control group members (X), or $7.50x. The $7.50x of gain is computed as the product of the inside gain ($50x) multiplied by X's ownership interest percentage in UST (15%). Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(5), the $50x of inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value ($200x) of the section 367(a) property (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(10), or Asset A and the CFC1 stock) exceeds the sum of the inside basis ($150x) of such property and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(9), or 100%) multiplied by UST's deductible liabilities (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(2), or $0x). Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(4), the inside basis equals the aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange ($150x), increased by any gain or deemed dividends recognized by UST with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367 ($0x), but not including the $7.50x of gain recognized by UST under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i). Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(e)(1), the $7.50x of gain recognized by UST is treated as recognized with respect to the CFC1 stock and Asset A in proportion to the amount of gain realized in each. However, because there is no gain realized by UST with respect to Asset A, all $7.50x of the gain is allocated to the CFC1 stock. Furthermore, FA's basis in the CFC1 stock, as determined under section 362 is increased by the $7.50x of gain recognized by UST. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requirement to recognize gain under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) is not applicable because the portion of the inside gain attributable to US1 and US2 (control group members) can be preserved in the stock received by each such shareholder. As described in paragraph (ii)(B) of this Example 1, the inside gain is $50x.

The $5x of gain recognized is not included in the computation of inside basis (see Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(4)(i)), but reduces (but not below zero) the amount of gain recognized by UST pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) that is attributable to US2. Furthermore, FA's basis in the CFC1 stock as determined under section 362 is increased for the $5x of gain recognized. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B). Assuming US1 and X enter into the gain recognition agreements described in paragraph (ii)(B) of this Example 2, and UST recognizes the $5x of gain described in this example, the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) are satisfied and, accordingly, UST does not recognize the remaining $95x of gain realized in the CFC1 stock pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> As described in paragraph (ii)(B) of Example 1, UST must recognize $7.50x of gain pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i), the amount of the $50x of inside gain attributable to X. Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(e)(1), the $7.50x of gain recognized by UST is treated as recognized with respect to the CFC1 stock and Asset A in proportion to the amount of gain realized in each. However, because there is no gain realized by UST with respect to Asset A, all $7.50x of the gain is allocated to the CFC1 stock. Furthermore, FA's basis in the CFC1 stock as determined under section 362 is increased for the $7.50x of gain recognized.

However, if UST were required to recognize gain pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) for inside gain attributable to US2 (for example, if US2 received solely cash rather than FA stock in the reorganization), the amount of such gain would be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of gain recognized by UST pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section that is attributable to US2 (computed as $5x in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 2).

The UST stock owned by US1 has a $180x basis and $200x fair market value; the UST stock owned by US2 has a $100x basis and $120x fair market value; and the UST stock owned by X has a $80x fair market value. UST owns Asset A, and all the stock of CFC1 and CFC2. UST has no liabilities. Asset A has a $10x basis and $200x fair market value. The CFC1 stock is a single block of stock (as defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(2)) with a $20x basis, $40x fair market value, and $30x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248 (with the result that the section 1248 amount (as defined in Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(c)(9)) is $20x). The CFC2 stock is also a single block of stock with a $30x basis, $160x fair market value, and $150x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248 (with the result that the section 1248 amount is $130x).

UST's transfer of the CFC1 stock, CFC2 stock, and Asset A to FA in exchange for the 60 shares of FA stock qualifies as a section 361 exchange. UST distributes the FA stock received in the section 361 exchange to US1, US2, and X pursuant to section 361(c)(1). US1, US2, and X exchange their UST stock for 30, 18, and 12 shares, respectively, of FA stock pursuant to section 354.

In this case, the requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied because the control requirement of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(1) is satisfied, and a stated assumption is that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) through 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) will be satisfied. The control requirement is satisfied because US1 and US2, each a control group member, own in the aggregate 80% of the UST stock immediately before the reorganization. The requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is not applicable because that paragraph applies to the transfer of stock of a domestic corporation, and CFC1 and CFC2 are foreign corporations.

See paragraph (e)(1) of this section. UST (the exchanging shareholder) is a U.S. person and a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC1 and CFC2 (each a foreign acquired corporation). However, UST is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($20x) or CFC2 stock ($130x) under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) because, immediately after UST's section 361 exchange of the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock for FA stock (and before the distribution of the FA stock to US1, US2, and X under section 361(c)(1), FA, CFC1, and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which UST is a section 1248 shareholder. See Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, if UST were required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock or CFC2 stock (for example, if FA were not a controlled foreign corporation), such deemed dividend would be taken into account prior to the application of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c). Furthermore, because US1, US2, and X are all persons described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, any such deemed dividend would increase inside basis.

The $68x of gain is computed as the product of the inside gain ($340x) multiplied by X's ownership interest percentage in UST (20%), reduced (but not below zero) by $0x, the sum of the amounts described in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(C). Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(5), the $340x of inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value ($400x) of the section 367(a) property (Asset A, CFC1 stock, and CFC2 stock) exceeds the sum of the inside basis ($60x) and $0x (the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by UST's deductible liabilities ($0x)). Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(4), the inside basis equals the aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property

transferred in the section 361 exchange ($60x), increased by any gain or deemed dividends recognized by UST with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367 ($0x), but not including the $68x of gain recognized by UST under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i). Under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(e)(1), the $68x gain recognized is treated as being with respect to the CFC1 stock, CFC2 stock, and Asset A in proportion to the amount of gain realized by UST on the transfer of the property. The amount treated as recognized with respect to the CFC1 stock is $4x ($68x gain multiplied by $20x/$340x). The amount treated as recognized with respect to the CFC2 stock is $26x ($68x gain multiplied by $130x/$340x). The amount treated as recognized with respect to Asset A is $38x ($68x gain multiplied by $190x/$340x). Under section 1248(a), UST must include in gross income as a dividend the $4x gain recognized with respect to the CFC1 stock and the $26x gain recognized with respect to CFC2 stock. Furthermore, FA's basis in the CFC1 stock, CFC2 stock, and Asset A, as determined under section 362, is increased by the amount of gain recognized by UST with respect to such property. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B). Thus, FA's basis in the CFC1 stock is $24x ($20x increased by $4x of gain), the CFC2 stock is $56x ($30x increased by $26x of gain), and Asset A is $48x ($10x increased by $38x of gain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The requirement to recognize gain under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) is not applicable because the portion of the inside gain attributable to US1 and US2 (control group members) can be preserved in the stock received by each such shareholder. As described in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 3, the inside gain is $340x. US1's attributable inside gain of $170x (equal to the product of $340x inside gain multiplied by US1's 50% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x, the sum of the amounts described in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3)) does not exceed $200x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $200x fair market value of FA stock received by US1). Similarly, US2's attributable inside gain of $102x (equal to the product of $340x inside gain multiplied by US2's 30% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x, the sum of the amounts described in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3)) does not exceed $120x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $120x fair market value of FA stock received by US2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Each control group member (US1 and US2) separately computes any required adjustment to stock basis under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(3).

Because UST does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to US1 under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this Example 3), the attributable inside gain of $170x with respect to US1 is not reduced under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(3)(i)(A). US1's outside gain (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(6)) in the FA stock is $20x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the $20x gain (equal to the difference between $200x fair market value and $180x section 358 basis in the FA stock). Thus, US1's $180x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $150x (the excess of $170x attributable inside gain, reduced by $0x, over $20x outside gain) to $30x. Similarly, US2's section 358 basis in the FA stock received of $100x (equal to US2's basis in the UST stock exchanged) is reduced to preserve the attributable inside gain with respect to US2, less any gain recognized with respect to US2 under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii). Because UST does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to US2 under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this Example 3), the attributable inside gain of $102x with respect to US2 is not reduced under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(3)(i)(A). US2's outside gain in the FA stock is $20x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the $20x gain (equal to the difference between $120x fair market value and $100x section 358 basis in FA stock). Thus, US2's $100x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $82x (the excess of $102x attributable inside gain, reduced by $0x, over $20x outside gain) to $18x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> UST's distribution of the FA stock to US1, US2, and X under section 361(c)(1) (new stock distribution) is subject to Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3).

US1's hypothetical section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is the amount that UST would have included in income as a deemed dividend under Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC1 stock if the requirements of Sec. 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($20x) and that would be attributable to US1's ownership interest percentage in UST (50%), reduced by the amount of gain recognized by UST under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) attributable to US1 and allocable to the CFC1 stock, but only to the extent such gain is treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) ($0x, as described in paragraphs (ii)(C) and (D) of this Example 3). Thus, US1's hypothetical section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is $10x ($20x multiplied by 50%, reduced by $0x).

Similarly, US1's hypothetical section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is $65x ($130x multiplied by 50%, reduced by $0x), and the attributable share amount is $2.17x ($65x/30 shares). Similarly, US2's hypothetical section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is $6x ($20x multiplied by 30%, reduced by $0x), and the attributable share amount is also $.33x ($6x/18 shares). Finally, US2's hypothetical section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is $39x ($130x multiplied by 30%, reduced by $0x), and the attributable share amount is also $2.17x ($39x/18 shares). Thus, the sum of the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock attributable to shares of stock of FA distributed to US1 and US2 is $120x ($10x plus $65x plus $6x plus $39x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the shares of FA stock are divided into portions, Sec. 1.1248(f)-2(d)(2) applies to attribute the attributable share amount to portions of shares of FA stock distributed to US1 and US2.

Thus, the attributable share amount of $.33x with respect to the CFC1 stock is attributed to the portion of each of the 30 shares and 18 shares of FA stock received by US1 and US2, respectively, that relates to the CFC1 stock. Similarly, the attributable share amount of $2.17x with respect to the CFC2 stock is attributed to the portion of each of the 30 shares and 18 shares of FA stock received by US1 and US2, respectively, that relates to the CFC2 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The total section 1248(f) amount ($120x) that UST is otherwise required to include in gross income as a dividend under Sec. 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is reduced by $120x, the sum of the portions of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock that are attributable to the shares of FA stock distributed to US1 and US2.

The rules of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X, a U.S. corporation, is a calendar year taxpayer. On January 1, 1981, X established a branch in foreign country A to manufacture and sell X's products in country A. On July 1, 1986, X organized corporation Y, a country A subsidiary, and transferred to Y all of the assets of its country A branch, including goodwill and going concern value. During the period from January 1, 1981, through July 1, 1986, X's country

A branch earned income and incurred losses in the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0">Country A Branch------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Ordinary   Capital</p><p class="depth0">Year                           income     gain</p><p class="depth0"><em>(loss)</em>    (loss)------------------------------------------------------------------------1981................................................     (200)        01982................................................     (300)     (100)1983................................................

(100)        01986................................................       50         0------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">At the time of the transfer of X's country A branch assets to Y, those assets had a fair market value of $2,500 and an adjusted basis of $1,000. For each of the assets, fair market value exceeded adjusted basis. X had no net capital loss or unused investment credit during any taxable year relevant to the transfer. In 1984, X incurred a net operating loss of $400, $200 of which was carried back to prior years. An additional $50 of the 1984 net operating loss was carried over to 1985. The remaining $150 of the 1984 net operating loss was not used in any year prior to the transfer. In 1979, X paid creditable foreign taxes of $330 that could not be claimed as a credit in that year or any earlier year because of section 904. Of those foreign taxes, $100 were carried over and claimed as a credit in 1983, but the remaining $230 were not used in any year prior to the transfer. X was not required to recognize any gain under section 904(f)(3) on account of the 1986 transfer or any prior transfer. X was not required to recognize gain upon the transfer under section 367(a) (other than by reason of the provisions of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Previously deducted losses. The previously deducted losses of X's country A branch are $575 of ordinary losses and $25 of capital losses, computed as follows: Initially, the branch has previously deducted ordinary losses of $1,000 ($200+$300+$400+$100), and previously deducted capital losses of $100. (See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Expired losses and credits. Under the facts of this example, there are no reductions for expired net ordinary losses or expired net capital losses under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. However, the previously deducted losses are reduced proceeding from the first branch loss year to the last branch loss year to reflect the expired foreign tax credit from 1979. The amount of the foreign tax credit loss equivalent with respect to 1981 is $500 ($230/.46). It reduces the previously deducted losses for 1981 proportionately. Thus, the previously deducted ordinary loss for 1981 is reduced from $200 to $0. (See paragraph (d)(4) of this section.) The amount of the foreign tax credit loss equivalent with respect to 1982 is $300 ($500-$200, i.e., $138/.46). (See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.) It reduces the previously deducted losses for 1982 proportionately. Thus, the previously deducted ordinary loss for 1982 is reduced from $300 to $75, and the previously deducted capital loss for 1982 is reduced from $100 to $25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Further reductions. The previously deducted ordinary losses of $575 and the previously deducted capital losses of $25 are reduced by the taxable income earned by the branch prior to the date of the transfer ($250). (See paragraph (e)(2) of this section.) Since that income was ordinary income, it is applied first to reduce the previously deducted ordinary losses of $575 to $325. (See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Recapture. Since the gain realized by X upon its transfer of the branch assets to Y exceeds the sum of the previously deducted branch losses as defined and reduced above $325+$25), the limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply. Thus, X is required to recognize $325 of ordinary income and $25 of long-term capital gain upon the transfer. (See paragraph (b) and (c)(1) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Definition of foreign branch--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, the term foreign branch means an integral business operation carried on by a U.S. person outside the United States. Whether the activities of a U.S. person outside the United States constitute a foreign branch operation must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. Evidence of the existence of a foreign branch includes, but is not limited to, the existence of a separate set of books and records, and the existence of an office or other fixed place of business used by employees or officers of the U.S. person in carrying out business activities outside the United States. Activities outside the United States shall be deemed to constitute a foreign branch for purposes of this section if the activities constitute a permanent establishment under the terms of a treaty between the United States and the country in which the activities are carried out. Any U.S. person may be treated as having a foreign branch for purposes of this section, whether that person is a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the term foreign branch means an integral business operation carried on by a U.S. person outside the United States. Whether the activities of a U.S. person outside the United States constitute a foreign branch operation must be determined under all the facts and circumstances. Evidence of the existence of a foreign branch includes, but is not limited to, the existence of a separate set of books and records, and the existence of an office or other fixed place of business used by employees or officers of the U.S. person in carrying out business activities outside the United States. Activities outside the United States shall be deemed to constitute a foreign branch for purposes of this section if the activities constitute a permanent establishment under the terms of a treaty between the United States and the country in which the activities are carried out. Any U.S. person may be treated as having a foreign branch for purposes of this section, whether that person is a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> More than one branch. If a U.S. person carries on more than one branch operation outside the United States, then the rules of this section must be separately applied with respect to each foreign branch that is transferred to a

foreign corporation. Thus, the previously deducted losses of one branch may not be offset, for purposes of determining the gain required to be recognized under the rules of this section, by the income of another branch that is also transferred to a foreign corporation. Similarly, the losses of one branch shall not be recaptured upon a transfer of the assets of a separate branch. Whether the foreign activities of a U.S. person are carried out through more than one branch must be determined under all of the facts and circumstances. In general, a separate branch exists if a particular group of activities is sufficiently integrated to constitute a single business that could be operated as an independent enterprise. For purposes of determining the combination of activities that constitute a branch operation as defined in this paragraph (g), the nominal relationship among those activities shall not be controlling. Factors suggesting that nominally separate business operations constitute a single foreign branch include a substantial identity of products, customers, operational facilities, operational processes, accounting and record-keeping functions, management, employees, distribution channels, or sales and purchasing forces. For examples of the application of the principles of this paragraph (g)(2), see Revenue Ruling 81-82, 1981-1 C.B. 127.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consolidated group. For purposes of this section, the activities of each of two domestic corporations outside the United States will be considered to constitute a single foreign branch if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The two corporations are members of the same consolidated group of corporations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The activities of the two corporations in the aggregate would constitute a single foreign branch if conducted by a single corporation.
Notwithstanding the preceding rule of this paragraph (g)(3), gains of a foreign branch of a domestic corporation arising in a year in which that corporation did not file a consolidated return with a second domestic corporation shall not be applied to reduce the previously deducted losses of a foreign branch of the second corporation (but may be applied to reduce such losses of the foreign branch of the first corporation) upon the transfer of the two branches to a foreign corporation, even though the two domestic corporations file a consolidated return for the year in which the transfer occurs and the two branches are considered at that time to constitute a single foreign branch. For an example of the application of the principles of this paragraph (g)(3), see Revenue Ruling 81-89, 1981-1 C.B. 129.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property not transferred. A U.S. transferor's failure to transfer any property of a foreign branch shall be irrelevant to the determination of the previously deducted losses of the branch subject to recapture under the rules of this section. Thus, if the activities with respect to untransferred property constituted a part of the branch operation under the rules of this paragraph (g), then the losses generated by those activities shall be subject to recapture, notwithstanding the failure to transfer the property. For an example of the application of the principles of this paragraph (g)(4), see Revenue Ruling 80-247, 1980-2 C.B. 127, relating to property abandoned by the U.S. transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Anti-abuse rule. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A U.S. person transfers property of a foreign branch to a domestic corporation for a principal purpose of avoiding the effect of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The domestic corporation thereafter transfers the property of the foreign branch to a foreign corporation,
Then, solely for purposes of this section, that U.S. person shall be treated as having transferred the property of the branch directly to the foreign corporation. A U.S. person shall be presumed to have transferred property of a foreign branch for a principal purpose of avoiding the effect of this section if the property is transferred to the domestic corporation less than two years prior to the domestic corporation's transfer of the property to a foreign corporation. This presumption may be rebutted by clear evidence that the subsequent transfer of the property was not contemplated at the time of the initial transfer to the domestic corporation and that avoidance of the effect of this section was not a principal purpose for the transaction. A transfer may have more than one principal purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basis adjustments. Basis adjustments reflecting gain recognized pursuant to this section shall be made as described in Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Expiration date.

Sec. 1.367(a)-7  Outbound transfers of property described in section 361(a) or (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and purpose. This section provides rules under section 367(a)(5) that apply to the transfer of certain property (including stock or securities) by a domestic corporation (U.S. transferor) to a foreign corporation (foreign acquiring corporation) in a section 361 exchange. This section applies only to the transfer of section 367(a) property. See section 367(d) for rules applicable to transfers of section 367(d) property. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule requiring the recognition of gain on the transfer of section 367(a) property, while paragraph (c) of this section provides an elective exception to the general rule that is available if certain requirements are satisfied. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for applying the elective exception to a section 361 exchange followed by successive distributions to which section 355 applies. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for recognizing gain on section 367(a) property, not willful relief provisions, an anti-abuse rule, and special rules that take into account income inclusions under Sec. 1.367(b)-4 and gain recognition under Sec. 1.367(a)-6T. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions, and paragraph (g) of this section provides examples. Paragraph (h) of this section provides applicable cross-references, paragraph (i) of this section is reserved, and paragraph (j) of this section provides effective/applicability dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule--(1) Nonrecognition exchanges enumerated in section 367(a)(1). Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the exceptions to section 367(a)(1) provided in section 367(a) and the regulations under that section do not apply to a transfer of section 367(a) property by a U.S. transferor to a foreign acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange, and the U.S. transferor shall recognize any gain (but not loss) realized with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367(a)(1). Realized gain is recognized pursuant to the prior sentence notwithstanding the application of any other nonrecognition provision enumerated in section 367(a)(1) to the transfer (such as section 351 or 354).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nonrecognition exchanges enumerated in section 367(a)(1). Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the exceptions to section 367(a)(1) provided in section 367(a) and the regulations under that section do not apply to a transfer of section 367(a) property by a U.S. transferor to a foreign acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange, and the U.S. transferor shall recognize any gain (but not loss) realized with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367(a)(1).

To the extent a transfer of items of property described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section also qualifies for nonrecognition under a provision that is not enumerated in section 367(a)(1) (such as section 1036), the U.S. transferor recognizes gain or loss realized on the transfer of such items of property, but the amount of loss recognized on the property shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized on the property. See section 337(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elective exception. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to the transfer of section 367(a) property by a U.S. transferor to a foreign acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange if the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section are satisfied, and an election to apply the exception provided by this paragraph (c) is made in the manner provided by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If this paragraph (c) applies to the section 361 exchange, see, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-2T, 1.367(a)-3T, 1.367(a)-4T, 1.367(a)-5T, or 1.367(a)-6T, as applicable, for additional requirements that must be satisfied in order for the U.S. transferor to not recognize gain under section 367(a)(1) on the transfer of section 367(a) property in the section 361 exchange.

The analysis of the following examples is limited to a discussion of issues under this section. Unless otherwise indicated, for purposes of the following examples: DP1, DP2, and DC are domestic corporations that do not join in the filing of a consolidated return and none of which is a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; FP and FA are foreign corporations created or organized under the laws of Country B and are unrelated to DP1, DP2, and DC; each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding; each share of stock of DC owned by a shareholder of DC has an identical stock basis; Business A consists solely of section 367(a) property whose fair market value exceeds its basis and that, but for the application of this section, would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception under Sec. 1.367(a)-2T; the fair market value of any FA stock received in a reorganization is equal to the fair market value of property exchanged therefor; FA is not a surrogate foreign corporation for purposes of section 7874 because one or more of the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) is not satisfied; DC has no liabilities; DP1 and DP2 satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, and DC satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DP1, DP2, and FP own 50%, 30%, and 20%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DP1 and DP2 are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504. DP1's DC stock has a $120x basis and $100x fair market value. DP2's DC stock has a $50x basis and $60x fair market value. DC owns inventory with a $40x basis and a $100x fair market value. DC also owns Business A (excluding the inventory) with a $10x basis and $100x fair market value. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F), DC transfers the inventory and Business A to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of FA. DC's transfer of the inventory and Business A to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1, DP2, and FP exchange the DC stock for a proportionate amount of FA stock pursuant to section 354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) Under section 367(a)(3)(B)(i), DC must recognize $60x gain ($100x fair market value less $40x basis) on the transfer of the inventory to FA. The basis of the inventory in the hands of FA is increased by the gain recognized of $60x (that is, increased from $40x to $100x). See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B). Under section 367(a)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, DC's transfer of Business A to FA is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). As a result, DC must also generally recognize $90x gain ($100x fair market value less $10x basis) on the transfer of Business A to FA notwithstanding the application of section 361 (or any other nonrecognition provision enumerated in section 367(a)(1)). However, if the conditions and requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, DC's transfer of Business A to FA would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception provided by section 367(a)(3) and Sec. 1.367(a)-2T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under section 367(a)(3)(B)(i), DC must recognize $60x gain ($100x fair market value less $40x basis) on the transfer of the inventory to FA. The basis of the inventory in the hands of FA is increased by the gain recognized of $60x (that is, increased from $40x to $100x). See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B). Under section 367(a)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, DC's transfer of Business A to FA is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). As a result, DC must also generally recognize $90x gain ($100x fair market value less $10x basis) on the transfer of Business A to FA notwithstanding the application of section 361 (or any other nonrecognition provision enumerated in section 367(a)(1)). However, if the conditions and requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, DC's transfer of Business A to FA would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception provided by section 367(a)(3) and Sec. 1.367(a)-2T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation because DP1 and DP2 together own 80% of the stock of DC). DP1 and DP2 are treated as a single domestic corporation for this purpose under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section because DP1 and DP2 are members of the same affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section would be satisfied only if DC recognizes $18x gain on the transfer of Business A, which is the amount of inside gain attributable to FP, a non-control group member. The $18x gain equals the product of the inside gain ($90x) multiplied by FP's ownership interest percentage (20%) in DC, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section). Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the $90x inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value ($200x) of the section 367(a) property (inventory and Business A) exceeds $110x, the sum of the inside basis of $110x and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the deductible liabilities of DC ($0x). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the inside basis equals the $50x aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange, increased by the $60x gain recognized by DC on the transfer of the inventory to FA, but not by the $18x gain recognized by DC under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section attributable to FP. The section 367(a) percentage is 100% because the only assets transferred are the inventory and Business A, which are section 367(a) property. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $18x gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is treated as recognized with respect to Business A. FA's basis in Business A as determined under section 362 is increased for the $18x gain recognized. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is not applicable with respect to either DP1 or DP2 because the attributable inside gain with respect to each such shareholder can be preserved in the FA stock received. As stated in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 1, the amount of the inside gain is $90x. The attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 of $45x (equal to the product of $90x inside gain multiplied by DP1's 50% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section)) does not exceed $100x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $100x fair market value of FA stock received by DP1). Similarly, the attributable inside gain with respect to DP2 of $27x (equal to the product of $90x inside gain multiplied by DP2's 30% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section)) does not exceed $60x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $60x fair market value of FA stock received by DP2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Each control group member (DP1 and DP2) separately computes any required adjustment to stock basis under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. DP1's section 358 basis in the FA stock received of $120x (the amount of DP1's basis in the DC stock exchanged) is reduced to preserve the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1, less any gain recognized with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Because DC does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this Example 1), the attributable inside gain of $45x with respect to DP1 is not reduced under paragraph

(c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. DP1's outside loss in the FA stock is $20x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $20x loss (equal to the difference between $100x fair market value and $120x section 358 basis in FA stock). Thus, DP1's $120x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $65x (excess of $45x, reduced by $0x, over $20x outside loss) to $55x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> DP2's aggregate section 358 basis in the FA stock received of $50x (the amount of DP2's basis in the DC stock exchanged) is reduced to preserve the attributable inside gain with respect to DP2, less any gain recognized with respect to DP2 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Because DC does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP2 (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this Example 1), the attributable inside gain of $27x with respect to DP2 is not reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section. DP2's outside gain in the FA stock is $10x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $10x gain (equal to the difference between $60x fair market value and $50x section 358 basis in FA stock). Thus, DP2's $50x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $17x (excess of $27x, reduced by $0x, over the $10x outside gain) to $33x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Paragraph (c)(4) of this section would be satisfied only if DC complies with the requirements of Sec. 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), including filing with its timely filed return for the year of the reorganization a statement agreeing to file an amended return reporting the gain realized but not recognized on the section 361 exchange in certain cases if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions within the prescribed 60-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The triangular reorganization constitutes an indirect stock transfer under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(i), and DP1 properly files a gain recognition agreement under Sec. 1.367(a)-8 with respect to the transfer.

Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the $190x inside gain is the amount by which the $200x aggregate fair market value of Business A exceeds $10x (the sum of the inside basis of $10x and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the deductible liabilities of DC ($0x)). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the inside basis equals the $10x aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange (not increased by the $10x gain recognized by DC under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The section 367(a) percentage is 100% because the only asset transferred is Business A, which is section 367(a) property. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2), DP1 increases the basis of its DC stock by the $10x gain recognized, that is, from $170x to $180x. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $10x gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is treated as recognized with respect to Business A. FA's basis in Business A as determined under section 362 is increased for the $10x gain recognized.

DP1's section 358 basis in the FP stock is $180x, computed as $180x basis in DC stock, as determined in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 2, decreased by $20x cash received and increased by $20x gain recognized under section 356 (such amount equal to the lesser of the $20x cash received and the $20x gain in the DC stock, computed as $200x fair market value less $180x basis). Because DC recognizes $10x gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section as determined in paragraph (ii)(C) of this Example 2, the $190x attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 is reduced by $10x to $180x under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section. DP1's outside gain in the FP stock is $0x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $0x gain (the difference between $180x fair market value and $180x section 358 basis in FP stock).

DP1's outside gain in Share 1 and Share 2 in the aggregate is $15x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 75% multiplied by $20x (the difference between $200x aggregate fair market value and $180x aggregate section 358 basis in the FA stock received by DP1). Thus, DP1's section 358 basis in the FA stock ($180x) must be reduced by $120x (the excess of $135x attributable inside gain, reduced by $0x, over $15x outside gain) to $60x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the $120x reduction to basis is allocated between Share 1 and Share 2 based on the relative section 358 basis of each share. Therefore, the basis in Share 1 is reduced by $40x ($120x multiplied by $60x/$180x). As adjusted, DP1's basis in Share 1 is $20x ($60x less $40x). The basis in Share 2 is reduced by $80x ($120x multiplied by $120x/$180x). As adjusted, DP1's basis in Share 2 is $40x ($120x less $80x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section would be satisfied only if DC complies with the requirements of Sec. 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), including filing with its tax return for the year of the reorganization, a statement agreeing to file an amended return reporting the gain realized but not recognized on the section 361 exchange in certain cases if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions within the prescribed 60-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DP1 and FP own 80% and 20%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DC owns Business A with a basis of $0x and $100x fair market value. DP1's DC stock has a fair market value of $80x, and FP's DC stock has a fair market value of $20x. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC transfers Business A to FA in exchange for $80x of FA stock and $20x cash. DC's transfer of Business A to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1 exchanges its $80x of DC stock for $60x of FA stock and $20x cash, and FP exchanges its $20x of DC stock for $20x of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1). The fact that the $20x cash is distributed solely to DP1 does not change the analysis of the control requirement. The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization and is not affected by distributions of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1). The fact that the $20x cash is distributed solely to DP1 does not change the analysis of the control requirement. The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization and is not affected by distributions of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the ownership interest percentages of DP1 and FP immediately before the reorganization are 80% ($80x/($80x + $20x)) and 20% ($20x/($80x + $20x)), respectively. The fact that the $20x of cash is distributed solely to DP1 does not change this result. The distribution of the $20x of cash is not taken into account for purposes of the ownership interest percentage computation because the $20x of cash distributed by DC is provided by FA to DC in the section 361 exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except as follows. Business A has a fair market value of $80x (and not $100x) and DC also owns inventory with a basis of $0x and fair market value of $20x. DC transfers Business A, but not the inventory, to FA in exchange for $80x of FA stock. DP1 exchanges its $80x of DC stock for $60x of FA stock and the $20x of inventory, and FP exchanges its $20x of DC stock for $20x of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1). The fact that the $20x of inventory is not transferred to FA, but is instead distributed solely to DP1, does not change the analysis of the control requirement. The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization, and is not affected by distributions of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1).

The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization, and is not affected by distributions of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to the general rule of paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the ownership interest percentages of DP1 and FP immediately before the reorganization would be 80% ($80x/($80x + $20x)) and 20% ($20x/($80x + $20x)), respectively. In this case, however, the distribution of the $20x inventory to DP1 is taken into account for purposes of computing the ownership interest percentage of DP1 and FP because the inventory is not provided by FA to DC in the section 361 exchange. With respect to DP1, the numerator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $60x, computed as the fair market value of DC stock owned by DP1 immediately before the reorganization but reduced by the fair market value of the inventory distributed to DP1 ($80x less $20x). With respect to FP, the numerator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $20x, the fair market value of the DC stock owned by FP immediately before the reorganization. With respect to both DP1 and FP, the denominator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $80x, computed as

the fair market value of all DC stock immediately before the reorganization, but reduced by the fair market value of the inventory distributed to DP1 ($100x, less $20x). Accordingly, the ownership interest percentage of DP1 is 75% ($60x/$80x), and the ownership interest percentage of FP is 25% ($20x/$80x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Applicable cross-references.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (p). All of the examples are based solely on the following facts and any additional facts stated in the particular example. DC, a domestic corporation, wholly owns FS and FA, each a foreign corporation. In Year 1, pursuant to a transaction qualifying both as an exchange under section 351 and a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B), DC transferred all the FS stock to FA solely in exchange for voting stock of FA (FS Transfer). The fair market value of the FS stock exceeded DC's tax basis in the stock at the time of the FS transfer. Absent the application of section 367 to the transaction, DC's exchange of the FS stock for the stock of FA qualified as a tax-free exchange under sections 351(a) and section 354. Immediately after the transaction, both FA and FS were controlled foreign corporations (as defined in section 957). Furthermore, DC was a section 1248 shareholder (as defined in Sec. 1.367(b)-2(b)) with respect to FA and

FS, and a 5-percent shareholder with respect to FA for purposes of Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(ii). Thus, DC was required to recognize gain under section 367(a)(1) by reason of the FS Transfer unless DC timely filed an initial gain recognition agreement (GRA) as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section and complies in all material respects with the requirements of this section throughout the term of the GRA. The application of section 6038B is not addressed in these examples. DC may be subject to a penalty under section 6038B even if DC demonstrates under this section that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful. See Sec. 1.6038B-1(b) and (f) for the application of section 6038B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC filed its tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, reporting no gain with respect to the exchange of the FS stock. DC, through its tax department, was aware of the requirement to file a GRA in order for DC to avoid recognizing gain with respect to the FS Transfer under section 367(a)(1), and had the experience and competency to properly prepare the GRA. DC had filed many GRAs over the years and had never failed to timely file a GRA. However, although DC prepared the GRA with respect to the FS Transfer, it was not filed with DC's tax return for the year of the FS Transfer due to an accidental oversight. During the preparation of the following year's tax return, DC discovered that the GRA was not filed. DC filed an amended return to file the GRA and complied with the procedures set forth under paragraph (p)(2) of this section promptly after it became aware of the failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC failed to file a GRA with its timely filed tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, there is a failure to timely file the GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, based on the facts of this Example 1, including that the failure to timely file the GRA was an isolated and accidental oversight, the failure to timely file is not a willful failure to file. Accordingly, the timely filed requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is considered to be satisfied, and DC is not required to recognize the gain realized on the FS Transfer under section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC filed its tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, reporting no gain with respect to the exchange of the FS stock, but failed to file a GRA. DC, through its tax department, was aware of the requirement to file a GRA in order for DC to avoid recognizing gain with respect to the FS Transfer under section 367(a)(1). DC had not consistently and in a timely manner filed GRAs in the past, and also had an established history of failing to timely file other tax and information returns for which it was subject to penalties. In a year subsequent to Year 1, DC transferred stock of another foreign subsidiary with respect to which DC had a built-in gain (FS2) to FA in a transaction that qualified as both a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B) and an exchange described under section 351 (FS2 Transfer). DC was required to recognize gain on the FS2 Transfer under section 367(a)(1) unless DC timely filed a GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section and complied with the requirements of this section during the term of the GRA. DC reported no gain on the FS2 Transfer on its tax return, but failed to file a GRA. At the time of the FS2 Transfer, DC was already aware of its failure to file the GRA required for the prior FS Transfer, but had not implemented any safeguards to ensure that it would timely file GRAs for future transactions. DC filed an amended return to file the GRA for the FS2 Transfer and complied with the procedures set forth under paragraph (p)(2) of this section promptly after it became aware of the failure. DC asserts that its failure to timely file a GRA with respect to the FS2 Transfer was due to an isolated oversight similar to the one that occurred with respect to the FS Transfer. At issue is DC's failure to timely file a GRA for the FS2 Transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC failed to file a GRA with its timely filed tax return for the year of the FS2 Transfer, there is a failure to timely file the GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. DC's course of conduct is taken into account in determining whether its failure to timely file a GRA for the FS2 Transfer was willful. Based on the facts of this Example 2, including DC's history of failing to file required tax and information returns in general and GRAs in particular, and its failure to implement safeguards to ensure that it would timely file GRAs, the failure to timely file a GRA with respect to the FS2 Transfer rises to the level of a willful failure to timely file. Accordingly, DC is ineligible for relief under paragraph (p) of this section, the GRA is not considered timely filed for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC must recognize the full amount of the gain realized on the FS2 Transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC timely filed its tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, reporting no gain with respect to the exchange of the FS stock. DC was aware of the requirement to file a GRA to avoid recognizing gain under section 367(a)(1), including the requirement to provide the basis and fair market value of the transferred stock. However, DC filed a purported GRA that did not contain

the fair market value of the FS stock. Instead, the GRA was filed with the statement that the fair market value information was ``available upon request.'' Other than the omission of the fair market value of the FS stock, the GRA contained all other information required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC omitted the fair market value of the FS stock from the GRA, the GRA was not completed in all material respects. Accordingly, there is a failure to timely file the GRA. Furthermore, because DC knowingly omitted such information, DC's omission is a willful failure to timely file a GRA. Accordingly, DC is ineligible for relief under paragraph (p) of this section, the GRA is not considered timely filed for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC must recognize the full amount of the gain realized on the FS Transfer. The same result would arise if DC had included the fair market value of the FS stock, but knowingly omitted its tax basis from the GRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. When DC filed its tax return for the tax year of the FS Transfer, it was aware of the requirement to file a GRA to avoid recognizing gain under section 367(a)(1). However, because DC anticipated selling Business A in the following tax year, which was expected to produce a capital loss that could be carried back to fully offset the gain recognized on the FS Transfer, DC intentionally chose not to file a GRA. DC recognized the gain from the FS Transfer under section 367(a)(1) and reported the gain on its timely filed tax return. At the end of the following year, a large class action lawsuit was filed against Business A and, consequently, DC was unable to sell the business. As a result, DC did not realize the expected capital loss, and it was not able to offset the gain from the FS Transfer. DC now seeks to file a GRA for the FS Transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC failed to file a GRA with its timely filed tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, there is a failure to timely file the GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Furthermore, because DC intentionally chose not to file a GRA for the FS Transfer, its actions constitute a willful failure to timely file a GRA. Accordingly, DC is ineligible for relief under paragraph (p) of this section, the GRA is not considered timely filed for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC must recognize the full amount of the gain realized on the FS Transfer in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Examples--(1) Presumed facts and references.

In year 3, pursuant to a section 351 exchange, TFC transfers all of the TFD stock to F1 in exchange solely for voting stock of F1. UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, and therefore the transfer by TFC of the TFD stock to F1 is not a triggering event. Under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the existing gain recognition agreement terminates without further effect. In year 4, in an exchange to which section 721

applies, UST contributes the TFC stock received in the initial transfer to PRS, a domestic partnership, in exchange for a partnership interest. UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, and therefore the transfer by UST of the TFC stock to PRS is not a triggering event. Under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the new gain recognition agreement filed by UST in year 3 terminates without further effect. In year 5, TFD disposes of substantially all of its assets in a transaction that constitutes a triggering event under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, UST recognizes the gain realized but not recognized on the initial transfer by reason of entering into the gain recognition agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the basis of the PRS interest held by UST, the TFC stock held by PRS that was received from UST in year 4, the F1 stock held by TFC that was received in exchange for the TFD stock in year 3, and the TFD stock held by F1 that was received from TFC in year 3 is increased by the amount of gain recognized by UST (but not by the additional tax or interest paid as result of such gain) with respect to the initial transfer under the gain recognition agreement. However, the basis of the assets of TFD (including the assets disposed of in year 5) is not increased as a result of the gain recognized by UST.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. At the time of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis, a $100x fair market value, and a $30x section 1248 amount. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is $50x. UST did not make an election under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section with respect to the gain recognition agreement. In year 3, TFC disposes of the TFD stock received in the initial transfer in exchange for $120x cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result--(A) Gain recognition without an election. The disposition by TFC of the TFD stock in year 3 is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. As a result, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, UST must recognize and include in income $50x gain under the gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, UST must report the $50x gain on an amended return filed for the taxable year of the initial transfer. Under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, UST must pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the $50x gain recognized. Under section 1248(a), $30x of the gain recognized by UST under the gain recognition agreement is recharacterized as a dividend. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer and the TFD stock received by TFC in the initial transfer, respectively, is increased by $50x. After taking into account the increase to the basis of the TFD stock, TFC recognizes $20x gain on the disposition of the TFD stock in year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Gain recognition without an election. The disposition by TFC of the TFD stock in year 3 is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. As a result, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, UST must recognize and include in income $50x gain under the gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, UST must report the $50x gain on an amended return filed for the taxable year of the initial transfer. Under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, UST must pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the $50x gain recognized. Under section 1248(a), $30x of the gain recognized by UST under the gain recognition agreement is recharacterized as a dividend. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer and the TFD stock received by TFC in the initial transfer, respectively, is increased by $50x. After taking into account the increase to the basis of the TFD stock, TFC recognizes $20x gain on the disposition of the TFD stock in year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gain recognition with an election. If UST made an election under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section with the gain recognition agreement filed for the initial transfer, the result would be the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this Example 2, except that UST must include in income the $50x gain recognized under the gain recognition agreement on its tax return filed for year 3. Any additional tax due with respect to the $50x gain and applicable interest on the additional tax due must be included with such return. The amount, if any, of the $50x gain recognized by UST under the gain recognition agreement that is characterized as a dividend under section 1248(a) is determined in year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. UST wholly owns DC. In year 3, pursuant to a section 351 exchange, UST transfers all of the TFC stock received in the initial transfer to DC in an exchange solely for voting stock of DC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The year 3 transfer of the TFC stock by UST to DC constitutes a triggering event under paragraph (j)(4) of this section. However, the transfer shall not constitute a triggering event pursuant to paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer that designates DC as the U.S. transferor for purposes of this section. Pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, if DC is required to recognize gain under the new gain recognition agreement, the basis of the stock of TFC and TFD would be increased by the amount of gain recognized. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, no adjustment would be made to the basis of the DC voting stock received by UST in year 3 as a result of such gain recognition. Alternatively, if the conditions for the application of paragraph (k)(14) of this section are satisfied UST could instead enter into the new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC wholly owns FA. In year 3, pursuant to a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), UST transfers all of the TFC stock received in the initial transfer to FA in exchange solely for 20% of the outstanding voting stock of DC. At the time of the reorganization, the TFC stock has a basis in excess of fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) The transfer by UST of the TFC stock to FA is an indirect stock transfer under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(iii)(B). Accordingly, to preserve nonrecognition treatment,

Assume further that in year 4 TFC disposes of 10% of the TFD stock pursuant to a transaction that constitutes a triggering event with respect to GRA 1. The disposition of the TFD stock is not a triggering event with respect to GRA 2 because the TFD stock disposed of does not constitute substantially all the assets of TFC. Under paragraphs (j)(1) and (c)(1)(i) of this section, USP must recognize $5x gain (10% of $50x) under GRA 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer (with respect to which GRA 1 was filed), the basis of the TFC stock and TFD stock, respectively, is increased by $5x. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the amount of gain subject to GRA 1 is reduced from $50x to $45x.

In year 3, TFD distributes all of its assets to TFC pursuant to a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply. Under paragraph (k)(8) of this section, UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer such that the liquidation is not a triggering event. Under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the new gain recognition agreement is subject to the conditions and requirements of this section to the same extent as the existing gain recognition agreement, except that the transferred stock is no longer subject to the gain recognition agreement because the transferred stock is cancelled by reason of the liquidation. In year 5 TFC disposes of substantially all of the assets received from TFD in the year 3 liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The year 5 disposition by TFC of substantially all of the assets received from TFD in the year 3 liquidation is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and therefore UST must recognize the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement. UST must report the gain recognized on an amended return for the taxable year during which the initial transfer occurred. UST must also pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the gain recognized. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer is increased as of the date of the initial transfer by the amount of gain recognized under the gain

As a result, UST is treated as retaining an indirect interest in the TFD stock following the complete liquidation of F1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section is satisfied if UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement. Because after the complete liquidation of F1, UST wholly owns TFC, which wholly owns TFD, as was the case immediately after the initial transfer, UST is not required to describe, with the new gain recognition agreement, other dispositions or events that would constitute triggering events based on the principles of paragraph (j) of this section, other than the dispositions or events described in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The transfer of the TFC stock by UST to DC constitutes a triggering event under paragraph (j)(4) of this section. However, under paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section, the transfer of the TFC stock shall not constitute a triggering event if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement that designates DC as the U.S. transferor for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternate facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 11, except that UST transfers only 90% of the TFC stock to DC.

Thus, the conditions of paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section are satisfied if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the TFC stock received from UST. The amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by DC equals 90% of the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer is reduced by the amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by DC. The gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer continues to apply to the remaining TFC stock held by UST.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

paragraph (j) of this section. For example, a complete or partial disposition of the F1 stock would constitute a triggering event for purposes of the new gain recognition agreement (subject to the exceptions provided by paragraph (k) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. At the time of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is $50x.

At the time of the transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The F1 stock received by TFC represents 25% of the outstanding stock of F1. Without regard to the gain recognized under the gain recognition agreement and any adjustments to basis under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, under section 351(b) TFC would recognize $35x gain in connection with the transfer of the TFD stock to F1. UST complies with the conditions of paragraph (k)(3) of this section, and therefore the disposition by TFC of the TFD stock does not constitute a triggering event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (m)(1) of this section, UST must recognize $35x gain under the gain recognition agreement as a result of the year 3 disposition by TFC of the TFD stock. Thus, the amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by UST pursuant to paragraph (k)(3) of this section is $15x. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer, the basis of the TFD stock held by TFC is increased by $35x, the amount of the gain recognized by UST under the gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer is also increased by $35x. After taking into account the increase to the basis of the TFD stock under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, TFC recognizes $15x gain under section 351(b) in connection with the year 3 transfer of the TFD stock to F1. Under section 362(a), the basis of the TFD stock in the hands of F1 is $100x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. UST wholly owns FA. In year 3, in a transaction to which section 304(a)(1) applies, TFC transfers all of the TFD stock to FA in exchange for cash. Under section 304(a)(1), TFC and FA are treated as if TFC transferred the TFD stock to FA in a section 351 exchange in exchange solely for FA stock, and then FA redeemed the FA stock deemed issued in exchange for the cash. Under section 302(d), the redemption of the FA stock deemed issued by FA to TFC under section 304(a)(1) is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result.

Therefore, under the new gain recognition agreement UST must agree to treat as a triggering event a complete or partial disposition of the stock of FA. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, UST is permitted to enter into a single new gain recognition agreement in year 3, but the gain recognition agreement must provide a complete description of the section 304(a)(1) transaction including the deemed section 351 exchange and redemption of the FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In year 3, UST disposes of 60% of the TFC stock received in the initial transfer in a transaction in which the conditions of paragraph (o)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. Thus, the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is reduced by 60%. In year 5, TFC disposes of 50% of the TFD stock in a transaction that constitutes a triggering event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. As a result of the year 5 disposition by TFC of 50% of the TFD stock, under paragraphs (j)(1) and (c)(1)(i) of this section, UST must recognize and include in income 50% of the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement (because of the year 3 disposition of TFC stock, the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement equals 40% of the gain realized, but not recognized, on the initial transfer). UST must pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the gain recognized. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by UST (the remaining gain equals 20% of the gain realized, but not recognized, by UST on the initial transfer).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. UST wholly owns F1 and TFD. The F1 stock has a $100x basis and $90x fair market value, and the TFD stock has a $0x basis and $100x fair market value. UST

also owns real property with a $10x basis and $10x fair market value. In year 1, pursuant to a section 351 exchange, UST transfers the real property, the TFD stock, and the F1 stock to TFC in exchange solely for 20 shares of TFC stock. UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer of the TFD stock. The amount of the gain recognition agreement is $100x. UST takes the position that the basis of each share of TFC stock received in the exchange is $5.5x (a proportionate amount of the $110x aggregate basis of the transferred property). In year 3, UST disposes of all its TFC stock in a transaction in which all gain realized is recognized and included in taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The year 3 disposition of the TFC stock is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The disposition does not terminate the gain recognition agreement pursuant to paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section because the basis of each share of TFC stock received in exchange for the TFD stock in the initial transfer is $5.5x, which exceeds the $0x basis of the TFD stock at time of the initial transfer. However, under paragraph (o)(1)(iii) of this section, to satisfy the basis condition of paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section, UST can reduce the basis of the 10 shares of the TFC stock received in exchange for the TFD stock to $0x. If UST reduces the basis of the 10 shares of TFC stock to $0x, under paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section the disposition of the TFC stock shall not constitute a triggering event but instead shall terminate the gain recognition agreement without further effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. UST owns a 40 percent capital and profits interest in a foreign partnership (PRS). PRS wholly owns TFD and other assets with basis equal to fair market value. The TFD stock has a $50x basis and $200x fair market value. TFC wholly owns F1. On day 1 of year 1, in a section 351 exchange, UST transfers its PRS interest to TFC in exchange solely for stock of TFC (initial transfer). On that same day, in a section 351 exchange, TFC transfers the PRS interest received from UST to F1 in exchange solely for stock of F1. In year 3, PRS receives a $150x distribution from TFD to which section 301 applies. Under section 301(c), $25x of the distribution constitutes a dividend, $50x is applied against and reduces the basis of the TFD stock held by PRS, and the remaining $75x is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. With respect to the TFD stock deemed transferred by UST in the initial transfer, under section 301(c), $10x (40% of $25x) of the distribution constitutes a dividend, $20x (40% of $50x) is applied against and reduces the basis of TFD stock, and $30x (40% of $75x) is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. In year 5, pursuant to a distribution to which section 731 applies, PRS distributes all of the TFD stock to F1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) Successive section 351 transfers. Under section 367(a)(4) and Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(c)(3)(ii), the transfer of the PRS interest by UST to TFC is treated, for purposes of section 367(a), as a transfer by UST to TFC of its proportionate share of the TFD stock held by PRS (the initial transfer). The initial transfer by UST of the TFD stock to TFC is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1), unless UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to such transfer pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii) and this section. Under paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section, the gain recognition agreement must include a complete description of the transfer, including a description of the partners of PRS. Even if UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer, under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the subsequent transfer by TFC of the PRS interest to F1 is a triggering event unless UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer under paragraph (k)(14) that provides that, in addition to the triggering events provided in paragraph (j) of this section, a complete or partial disposition of the F1 stock received by TFC in exchange for the PRS interest shall constitute a triggering event for purposes of the gain recognition agreement. The new gain recognition agreement must also provide that any other disposition that is inconsistent with the principles of paragraph (k), including an indirect disposition of the TFD stock or of substantially all of the assets of TFD, shall constitute a triggering event for purposes of the new gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, UST is permitted to enter into a single gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer and the subsequent transfer by TFC of the PRS interest, but the agreement must include a complete description of the initial transfer and the subsequent transfer of the PRS interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Successive section 351 transfers. Under section 367(a)(4) and Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(c)(3)(ii), the transfer of the PRS interest by UST to TFC is treated, for purposes of section 367(a), as a transfer by UST to TFC of its proportionate share of the TFD stock held by PRS (the initial transfer). The initial transfer by UST of the TFD stock to TFC is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1), unless UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to such transfer pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii) and this section. Under paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section, the gain recognition agreement must include a complete description of the transfer, including a description of the partners of PRS. Even if UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer, under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the subsequent transfer by TFC of the PRS interest to F1 is a triggering event unless UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer under paragraph (k)(14) that provides that, in addition to the triggering events provided in paragraph (j) of this section, a complete or partial disposition of the F1 stock received by TFC in exchange for the PRS interest shall constitute a triggering event for purposes of the gain recognition agreement. The new gain recognition agreement must also provide that any other disposition that is inconsistent with the principles of paragraph (k), including an indirect disposition of the TFD stock or of substantially all of the assets of TFD, shall constitute a triggering event for purposes of the new gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, UST is permitted to enter into a single gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer and the subsequent transfer by TFC of the PRS interest, but the agreement must include a complete description of the initial transfer and the subsequent transfer of the PRS interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 301 distribution from TFD to PRS. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the section 301 distribution received by PRS from TFD is not a disposition (and therefore does not affect the gain recognition agreement) to the extent it is described in section 301(c)(1) or (2). However, under paragraph (n)(2) of this section, to the extent the distribution is described in section 301(c)(3), UST must recognize gain ($30x) under the gain recognition agreement.

The new gain recognition agreement need not describe additional dispositions or other events that would constitute triggering events because, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the dispositions or other events described in paragraph (j) of this section or in the existing gain recognition agreement apply to the new gain recognition agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. TFD has 10 shares of stock outstanding immediately before the initial transfer. On the date of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $0x basis and $90x fair market value. In year 2, in exchange for 1 share of TFD stock TFC transfers real estate to TFD with a $10x basis and $10x fair market value. In year 4, TFC distributes the 11 shares of TFD stock to UST in a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. In determining whether the gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer is terminated under paragraph (o)(5) of this section, or triggered under paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(4) of this section, only the 10 shares of TFD stock transferred by UST in the initial transfer are considered. Thus, the 1 share of TFD stock received by TFC in exchange for the real estate in year 2 is not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Before the initial transfer, the TFD stock has an $80x basis and a $100x fair market value, and the TFC stock has a $100x basis and a $100x fair market value. In year 4, TFC distributes all of the TFD stock to UST in a transaction to which section 355 applies. At the time of the distribution, the TFD stock has a $200x fair market value, and the TFC stock (without regard to the value of the TFD stock held by TFC) has a $100x fair market value. At such time, the TFC stock has a $180x basis. As determined under section 358, immediately after the distribution, the TFC stock has a $60x basis, and the TFD stock has a $120x basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The distribution of the TFD stock by TFC in year 4 is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The distribution does not terminate the gain recognition agreement under paragraph (o)(5) of this section because after the distribution, the basis of the TFD stock in the hands of UST ($120x) is greater than the basis of the TFD stock at the time of the initial transfer ($80x). However, if UST reduces the basis of the TFD stock to $80x (as provided under paragraph (o)(5)(iii) of this section) the gain recognition agreement will terminate without further effect. If UST does not elect to reduce the basis of the TFD stock, see paragraph (k)(14) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. At the time of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The amount of the gain recognition agreement is $50x. In year 3, UST distributes all of the TFC stock to USP in a transaction to which section 301 applies. At the time of the distribution, the TFC stock has a $50x basis and $90x fair market value. Under section 311(b), UST must recognize $40x gain (the intercompany item) on the distribution, but because the distribution is an intercompany transaction, under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-13, the $40x gain is not taken into account in year 3. In year 4, USP sells all of the TFC stock to X, an unrelated corporation. Under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-13, in year 4 UST takes into account the $40x intercompany item as a result of the sale of the TFC stock to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) The year 3 distribution of the TFC stock by UST to USP does not terminate the gain recognition agreement under paragraph (o)(1) of this section because UST does not include the $40x gain in taxable income during year 3. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the year 3 distribution of the TFC stock by UST to USP is generally a triggering event; however, because the distribution is an intercompany transaction that creates an intercompany item, the distribution shall not constitute a triggering event if the conditions of paragraph (k)(12)(i) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied because the aggregate basis of the TFC stock distributed ($50x) is not greater than the sum of the aggregate basis of the TFD stock at the time of the initial transfer ($50x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied if the next annual certification for the existing gain recognition agreement includes a complete description of the intercompany transaction and an explanation of how the basis condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under paragraph (o)(6) of this section and the principles of paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section, because the year 4 sale of the TFC stock to X requires UST to take into account the $40x gain (the intercompany item) from the year 3 distribution, the year 4 sale terminates the gain recognition agreement. If, alternatively, in year 4 USP had sold only 30% of the TFC stock, then under paragraph (o)(6) of this section and the principles of paragraph (o)(1)(ii) of this section the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement would be reduced by 30%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternate facts. Intercompany transaction followed by sale of transferee foreign corporation to member. Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 20, except that, instead of USP selling the TFC stock to X, in year 4 USP sells the TFC stock to USS in exchange for $90x cash. UST and USS are members of the USP consolidated group immediately after the sale. The results of the year 3 distribution of the TFC stock by UST to USP are the same as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 20. In addition, under paragraph (k)(12)(ii) of this section, the year 4 sale by USP of the TFC stock to USS is not a triggering event, provided UST includes a complete description of the sale with the annual certification filed for the gain recognition agreement in year 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Alternate facts. Intercompany transaction followed by complete liquidation of transferee foreign corporation. Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 20, except that, instead of USP selling the TFC stock to X, in year 4 TFC distributes all of its assets to USP in a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply. The result is the same as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 20 because, under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-13, in year 4 UST takes into account the $40x gain (the intercompany item) from the year 3 distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Alternate facts. Intercompany transaction followed by triggering event. Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 20, except that instead of USP selling the TFC stock to X, in year 4 TFC disposes of all of the TFD stock in a transaction that constitutes a triggering event under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section UST must recognize $50x gain under the gain recognition agreement. Under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer the basis of the TFC stock and TFD stock, respectively, is increased by $50x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Alternate facts. Intercompany transaction followed by section 351 transfer to member. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 20, except that, in year 3, in a section 351 exchange UST transfers all of the TFC stock to USS in exchange for $10x cash and $80x of stock of USS. USS is a member of the USP consolidated group immediately after the exchange. The transfer of the TFC stock by UST to USS is an intercompany transaction. Under section 351(b), UST must generally recognize $10x gain (intercompany item) in connection with the transfer; however, under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-13, UST does not take the $10x gain into account in year 3. Under paragraph (k)(12) of this section, as result of the intercompany transaction creating an intercompany item ($10x gain), the existing gain recognition agreement ($50x gain) must be divided between UST and USS. UST shall remain subject to a gain recognition agreement of $10x (equal to the amount of the intercompany item). The amount of the gain recognition agreement entered into by USS under paragraph (k)(1) of this section is $40x (equal to the amount of the existing gain recognition agreement, reduced by the amount of the of the gain recognition agreement to which UST remains subject).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An individual (A) that is a United States citizen wholly owns TFD, TFC, and DC. A transfers the TFD stock to TFC in a section 351 exchange and enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to such transfer. In year 5, pursuant to an asset reorganization, TFC transfers all of its assets to DC in exchange solely for DC stock. TFC distributes the DC stock to A pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The transfer by TFC of the TFD stock to DC and the exchange by A of the TFC stock for DC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization are triggering events under paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(4) of this section, respectively. The gain recognition agreement does not terminate under paragraph (o)(5) of this section because DC is neither the U.S. transferor, nor an individual that is a United States person, nor a member of the same consolidated group of which the U.S. transferor is a member. However, if paragraph (k)(14) of this section applies the exchanges shall not constitute triggering events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(i) of this section is satisfied because the transfer of the TFD stock to DC qualifies as a nonrecognition transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(ii) of this section is satisfied because immediately after the transfer DC, a domestic corporation that is eligible to be a U.S. transferor, retains a direct interest in the TFD stock following the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section is satisfied if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer.

If the basis condition of paragraph (o)(5)(iii) were not satisfied, under paragraph (o)(5)(iii) of this section, DC could reduce the basis of the TFD stock received in the reorganization.

Under paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section, the rules of Sec. 1.367(a)-8T (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2007) apply to the transfers pursuant to the asset reorganization because the initial transfer occurred on March 7, 2007. As a result of the disposition of the TFC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization, under Sec. 1.367(a)-8T(d), USP is required to recognize the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement and pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to such gain. Because the acquiring corporation in the asset reorganization is foreign, an exception under Sec. 1.367(a)-8T(e) is not available for the exchange of TFC stock by USP. However, pursuant to paragraph (r)(2)(i) of this section, because the exception provided by paragraph (k)(14) of this section is not included in Sec. 1.367(a)-8T, USP may apply paragraph (k)(14) of this section to such exchange (provided the conditions of paragraph (k)(14) of this section are satisfied), if the statute of limitations on assessments of tax for the 2007 tax year has not closed. If USP applies paragraph (k)(14) of this section to its exchange of the TFC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization, under paragraph (r)(2)(ii) of this section USP must include the new gain recognition agreement required under paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section with an amended Federal income tax return for its 2008 tax year that is filed August 10, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

Sec. 1.367(a)-9T  Treatment of deemed section 351 exchanges pursuant to section 304(a)(1) (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and general rule. This section applies to the extent that, pursuant to section 304(a)(1), a United States person is treated as transferring stock of a domestic or foreign corporation to a foreign corporation (foreign acquiring corporation) in exchange for stock of the foreign acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies (deemed section 351 exchange). Except to the extent provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a transfer of stock by a United States person to a foreign acquiring corporation in a deemed section 351 exchange is not subject to section 367(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the distribution received by the United States person in redemption of the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation deemed issued in the deemed section 351 exchange is applied against and reduces (in whole or in part), pursuant to section 301(c)(2), the basis of stock of the foreign acquiring corporation held by the United States person other than the stock deemed issued in the deemed section 351 exchange, the United States person shall recognize gain pursuant to this paragraph (b). The exceptions described in Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1) and (c)(1) shall not apply to a transfer of stock described in paragraph (a) of this section. The amount of gain recognized by a United States person pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall equal the amount, if any, by which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gain realized by the United States person with respect to the transferred stock in connection with the deemed section 351 exchange exceeds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the distribution received by the United States person in redemption of the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation deemed issued in the deemed section 351 exchange that is treated as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) and included in gross income by the United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Ordering rule. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount of gain realized by the United States person in connection with the deemed section 351 exchange shall be determined without regard to the amount of gain recognized by the United States person under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of recognized gain. Gain recognized by a United States person pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as recognized with respect to the stock transferred in the deemed section 351 exchange in proportion to the amount of gain realized by the United States person with respect to such stock. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(b)(4) for additional rules on the character, source, and adjustments relating to gain recognized under section 367(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. (A) USP, a domestic corporation, wholly owns FC1 and FC2, each a foreign corporation. USP, FC1 and FC2 use a calendar taxable year. The FC1 stock has a $40x basis and $100x fair market value. The FC2 stock has a $100x basis and $100x fair market value. As of December 31, year 1, FC1 has zero earnings and profits, and FC2 has $20x earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, in a transaction described in section 304(a)(1), USP sells the FC1 stock to FC2 for $100x cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> USP, a domestic corporation, wholly owns FC1 and FC2, each a foreign corporation. USP, FC1 and FC2 use a calendar taxable year. The FC1 stock has a $40x basis and $100x fair market value. The FC2 stock has a $100x basis and $100x fair market value. As of December 31, year 1, FC1 has zero earnings and profits, and FC2 has $20x earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, in a transaction described in section 304(a)(1), USP sells the FC1 stock to FC2 for $100x cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Because USP wholly owns FC1 before the transactions and is treated, under section 318, as indirectly owning 100% of the FC1 stock after the transfer, under section 304(a)(1), USP and FC2 are treated in the same manner as if USP contributed the FC1 stock to FC2 in a deemed section 351 exchange in exchange solely for $100x of FC2 stock, and then FC2 redeemed for $100x cash its stock deemed issued to USP. Because USP wholly owns FC1 before the sale and is

treated as owning 100% of FC1 after the sale, section 302(a) does not apply to the redemption. Instead, under section 302(d), the redemption is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies. Pursuant to section 304(b)(2), $20x of the distribution is treated as a dividend from FC2. With respect to the remaining $80x, USP takes the position that $40x is applied against and reduces the basis of the FC2 stock issued in the deemed section 351 exchange, and $40x is applied against and reduces the basis of the FC2 stock held by USP prior to (and after) the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (b) of this section, USP must recognize gain of $40x on its transfer of the FC1 stock to FC2 in the deemed section 351 exchange (the amount by which the $60x gain realized by USP on the deemed section 351 exchange with respect to the F1 stock exceeds the $20x dividend inclusion). Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the exception under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b) is not available to the transfer of the FC1 stock by USP to FC2 in the deemed section 351 exchange. Thus, USP cannot avoid gain recognition under paragraph (b) of this section by entering into a gain recognition agreement with respect to its transfer of the FC1 stock to FC2 in the deemed section 351 exchange. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the $40x gain recognized is allocated among the shares of FC1 stock transferred to FC2 in the deemed section 351 exchange in proportion to the gain realized by USP on the transfer of such shares. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the application of paragraph (b) of this section is determined prior to taking into account the $40x increase to the basis of the FC1 stock transferred by USP. Under section 362, the basis of the FC1 stock in the hands of FC2 is increased by $40x, the amount of gain recognized by the USP on the transfer of the FC1 stock under paragraph (b) of this section. Under section 358, the basis of the FC2 stock received by USP in the deemed section 351 exchange is similarly increased by $40x. See Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(b)(4). The $40x increase to the basis of the FC2 stock is taken into account before determining the consequences of the redemption of such stock under section 304(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to transfers occurring on or after February 10, 2009. See Sec. 1.367(a)-3(a), as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2008, for transfers occurring on or after February 21, 2006, and before February 10, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Expiration date. This section expires on or before February 10, 2012.

Sec. 1.367(b)-1  Other transfers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The regulations promulgated under section 367(b) (the section 367(b) regulations) set forth rules regarding the proper inclusions and adjustments that must be made as a result of an exchange described in section 367(b) (a section 367(b) exchange). A section 367(b) exchange is any exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356 or 361, with respect to which the status of a foreign corporation as a corporation is relevant for determining the extent to which income shall be recognized or for determining the effect of the transaction on earnings and profits, basis of stock or securities, basis of assets, or other relevant tax attributes.

Sec. 1.367(b)-2  Definitions and special rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Controlled foreign corporation. The term controlled foreign corporation means a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957 (taking into account section 953(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 1248 shareholder. The term section 1248 shareholder means any United States person that satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1248 (a)(2) or (c)(2) with respect to a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 1248 amount--(1) Rule. The term section 1248 amount with respect to stock in a foreign corporation means the net positive earnings and profits (if any) that would have been attributable to such stock and includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations thereunder if the stock were sold by the shareholder. In the case of a transaction in which the shareholder is a foreign corporation (foreign shareholder), the following additional rules shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rule. The term section 1248 amount with respect to stock in a foreign corporation means the net positive earnings and profits (if any) that would have been attributable to such stock and includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations thereunder if the stock were sold by the shareholder. In the case of a transaction in which the shareholder is a foreign corporation (foreign shareholder), the following additional rules shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The foreign shareholder shall be deemed to be a United States person for purposes of this paragraph (c), except that the foreign shareholder shall not be considered a United States person for purposes of determining whether the stock owned by the foreign shareholder is stock of a controlled foreign corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign shareholder's holding period in the stock of the foreign corporation shall be determined by reference to the period that the foreign shareholder's section 1248 shareholders held (directly or indirectly) an interest in the foreign corporation. This paragraph (c)(1)(ii) applies in addition to the section 1248 regulations' incorporation of section 1223 holding periods. See Sec. 1.1248-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC1, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). FC1 owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a CFC. DC has always owned all of the stock of FC1, and FC1 has always owned all of the stock of FC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under this paragraph (c), DC's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC1 stock is computed by reference to all of FC1's and FC2's earnings and profits. See section 1248(c)(2). Because FC1's section 1248 shareholder (DC) always indirectly held all of the stock of FC2, FC1's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC2 stock is computed by reference to all of FC2's earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the outstanding stock of FC1, a foreign corporation. The other 60 percent of FC1 stock is owned (directly and indirectly) by foreign persons that are unrelated to DC. FC1 owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. On January 1, 2001, DC purchases the remaining 60 percent of FC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under this paragraph (c), DC's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC1 stock is computed by reference to FC1's and FC2's earnings and profits that accumulated on or after January 1, 2001, the date FC1 and FC2 became controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). See section 1248(a). Because FC1 is not considered a United States person for purposes of determining whether FC2 is a CFC, FC1's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC2 stock is computed by reference to FC2's earnings and profits that accumulated on or after January 1, 2001, the date FC2 became an actual CFC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FC1, a foreign corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1, FC2, and their direct and indirect owners. On January 1, 2001, DC purchases all of the outstanding stock of FC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under this paragraph (c), DC's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC1 stock is computed by reference to FC1's and FC2's earnings and profits that accumulated on or after January 1, 2001, the first day DC held the stock of FC1. See section 1248(a). FC1's section 1248 amount with respect to its FC2 stock is computed by reference to FC2's earnings and profits that accumulated on or after January 1, 2001, the first day FC1's section 1248 shareholder (DC) indirectly held the stock of FC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> All earnings and profits amount--(1) General rule. The term all earnings and profits amount with respect to stock in a foreign corporation means the net positive earnings and profits (if any) determined as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and attributable to such stock as provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The all earnings and profits amount shall be determined without regard to the amount of gain that would be realized on a sale or exchange of the stock of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The term all earnings and profits amount with respect to stock in a foreign corporation means the net positive earnings and profits (if any) determined as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and attributable to such stock as provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The all earnings and profits amount shall be determined without regard to the amount of gain that would be realized on a sale or exchange of the stock of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for determining earnings and profits--(i) Domestic rules generally applicable. For purposes of this paragraph (d), except as provided in sections 312(k)(4) and (n)(8), 964 and 986, the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be determined according to principles substantially similar to those applicable to domestic corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Domestic rules generally applicable. For purposes of this paragraph (d), except as provided in sections 312(k)(4) and (n)(8), 964 and 986, the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be determined according to principles substantially similar to those applicable to domestic corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain adjustments to earnings and profits. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (d), the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year shall not include the amounts specified in section 1248(d). In the case of amounts specified in section 1248(d)(4), the preceding sentence requires that the earnings and profits for any taxable year be decreased by the net positive amount (if any) of earnings and profits attributable to activities described in section 1248(d)(4), and increased by the net reduction (if any) in earnings and profits attributable to activities described in section 1248(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of section 332 liquidating distribution. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to stock of a corporation that distributes all of its property in a liquidation described in section 332 shall be determined without regard to the adjustments prescribed by section 312(a) and (b) resulting from the distribution of such property in liquidation, except that gain or loss realized by the corporation on the distribution shall be taken into account to the extent provided in section 312(f)(1). See Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(ii) Example 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount attributable to a block of stock--(i) Application of section 1248 principles--(A) In general--(1) Rule. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to stock of a foreign corporation is determined according to the attribution principles of section 1248 and the regulations thereunder. The attribution principles of section 1248 shall apply without regard to the requirements of section 1248 that are not relevant to the determination of a shareholder's pro rata portion of earnings and profits. Thus, for example, the all earnings and profits amount is determined without regard to whether the foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation at any time during the five years preceding the section 367(b) exchange in question, without regard to whether the shareholder owned a 10 percent or greater interest in the stock, and without regard to whether the earnings and profits of the foreign corporation were accumulated in post-1962 taxable years or while the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 2001, DC, a domestic corporation, purchases 9 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. On January 1, 2002, DC purchases an additional 1 percent of FC stock. On January 1, 2003, DC exchanges its stock in FC in a section 367(b) exchange in which DC is required to include the all earnings and profits amount in income. FC was not a controlled foreign corporation during the entire period DC held its FC stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to DC's stock in FC is computed by reference to 9 percent of FC's earnings and profits from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001, and by reference to 10 percent of FC's earnings and profits from January 1, 2002, through January 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreign shareholders. In the case of a transaction in which the exchanging shareholder is a foreign corporation (foreign shareholder), the following additional rules shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The attribution principles of section 1248 shall apply without regard to whether the person directly owning the stock is a United States person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The foreign shareholder's holding period in the stock of the foreign acquired corporation shall be determined by reference to the period that the foreign shareholder's United States shareholders (as defined in Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b)(2)) held (directly or indirectly) an interest in the foreign acquired corporation. This paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(2) applies in addition to the section 1248 regulations' incorporation of section 1223 holding periods. See Sec. 1.1248-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusion of lower-tier earnings. In applying the attribution principles of section 1248 and the regulations thereunder to determine the all earnings and profits amount with respect to stock of a foreign corporation, the earnings and profits of subsidiaries of

the foreign corporation shall not be taken into account notwithstanding section 1248(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of deemed dividends--(1) In general. In certain circumstances these regulations provide that an exchanging shareholder shall include an amount in income as a deemed dividend. This paragraph provides rules for the treatment of the deemed dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In certain circumstances these regulations provide that an exchanging shareholder shall include an amount in income as a deemed dividend. This paragraph provides rules for the treatment of the deemed dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consequences of dividend characterization. A deemed dividend described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be treated as a dividend for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. The deemed dividend shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits with respect to which the amount of the deemed dividend was determined. Thus, for example, a deemed dividend that is determined by reference to the all earnings and profits amount or the section 1248 amount will never be considered as paid out of (and therefore will never reduce) earnings and profits specified in section 1248(d), because such earnings and profits are excluded in computing the all earnings and profits amount (under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) and the section 1248 amount (under section 1248(d) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section). If the deemed dividend is determined by reference to the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation that is owned indirectly (i.e., through one or more tiers of intermediate owners) by the person that is required to include the deemed dividend in income, the deemed dividend shall be considered as having been paid by such corporation to such person through the intermediate owners, rather than directly to such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ordering rules. In the case of an exchange of stock in which the exchanging shareholder is treated as receiving a deemed dividend from a foreign corporation, the following ordering rules concerning the timing, treatment, and effect of such a deemed dividend shall apply. See also paragraph (j)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of the section 367(b) regulations, the gain realized by an exchanging shareholder shall be determined before increasing (as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) the basis in the stock of the foreign corporation by the amount of the deemed dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the deemed dividend shall be considered to be received immediately before the exchanging shareholder's receipt of consideration for its stock in the foreign corporation, and the shareholder's basis in the stock exchanged shall be increased by the amount of the deemed dividend. Such basis increase shall be taken into account before determining the gain otherwise recognized on the exchange (for example, under section 356), the basis that the exchanging shareholder takes in the property that it receives in the exchange (under section 358(a)(1)), and the basis that the transferee otherwise takes in the transferred stock (under section 362).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the earnings and profits of the appropriate foreign corporation shall be reduced by the deemed dividend amount before determining the consequences of the recognition of gain in excess of the deemed dividend amount (for example, under section 356(a)(2) or sections 356(a)(1) and 1248).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. DC, a domestic corporation, exchanges stock in FC, a foreign corporation, in a section 367(b) exchange in which DC includes the all earnings and profits amount in income as a deemed dividend. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a deemed dividend is treated as a dividend for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, if the requirements of section 902 are met, DC may qualify for a deemed paid foreign tax credit with respect to the deemed dividend that it receives from FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. DC, a domestic corporation, exchanges stock in FC1, a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation, in a transaction in which DC is required to include the section 1248 amount in income as a deemed dividend. A portion of the section 1248 amount is determined by reference to the earnings and profits of FC1 (the upper-tier portion of the section 1248 amount), and the remainder of the section 1248 amount is determined by reference to the earnings and profits of FC2, which is a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of FC1 (the lower-tier portion of the section 1248 amount). Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, DC computes its deemed paid foreign tax credit as if the

lower-tier portion of the section 1248 amount were distributed as a dividend by FC2 to FC1, and as if such portion and the upper-tier portion of the section 1248 amount were then distributed as a dividend by FC1 to DC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. DC, a domestic corporation, exchanges stock in FC, a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation, in a transaction in which DC realizes gain of $100 (prior to the application of the section 367(b) regulations). In connection with the transaction, DC is required to include $40 in income as a deemed dividend under the section 367(b) regulations. In addition to receiving property permitted to be received under section 354 without the recognition of gain, DC also receives cash in the amount of $70. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the $40 deemed dividend increases DC's basis in its FC stock before determining the gain to be recognized under section 356. Thus, in applying section 356, DC is considered to realize $60 of gain on the exchange, all of which is recognized under section 356(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Deemed asset transfer and closing of taxable year in certain section 368(a)(1)(F) reorganizations--(1) Scope.

In a reorganization described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, there is considered to exist--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A transfer of assets by the foreign transferor corporation to the acquiring corporation in exchange for stock (or stock and securities) of the acquiring corporation and the assumption by the acquiring corporation of the foreign transferor corporation's liabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A distribution of such stock (or stock and securities) by the foreign transferor corporation to its shareholders (or shareholders and security holders); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An exchange by the foreign transferor corporation's shareholders (or shareholders and security holders) of their stock (or stock and securities) for stock (or stock and securities) of the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other applicable rules. For purposes of this paragraph (f), it is immaterial that the applicable foreign or domestic law treats the acquiring corporation as a continuation of the foreign transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Closing of taxable year. In a reorganization described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the taxable year of the foreign transferor corporation shall end with the close of the date of the transfer and, except as otherwise required under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g. section 1502 and the regulations thereunder), the taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall end with the close of the date on which the transferor's taxable year would have ended but for the occurrence of the reorganization if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The acquiring corporation is a domestic corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign transferor corporation has effectively connected earnings and profits (as defined in section 884(d)) or accumulated effectively connected earnings and profits (as defined in section 884(b)(2)(B)(ii)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Stapled stock under section 269B. For rules addressing the deemed conversion of a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation under section 269B, see Sec. 1.269B-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Section 953(d) domestication elections--(1) Effect of election. A foreign corporation that elects under section 953(d) to be treated as a domestic corporation shall be treated for purposes of section 367(b) as transferring, as of the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is effective, all of its assets to a domestic corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F). Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, for purposes of determining the consequences of the reorganization under Sec. 1.367(b)-3, the all earnings and profits amount shall not be considered to include earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effect of election. A foreign corporation that elects under section 953(d) to be treated as a domestic corporation shall be treated for purposes of section 367(b) as transferring, as of the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is effective, all of its assets to a domestic corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F). Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, for purposes of determining the consequences of the reorganization under Sec. 1.367(b)-3, the all earnings and profits amount shall not be considered to include earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Post-election exchanges. For purposes of applying section 367(b) to post-election exchanges with respect to a corporation that has made a valid election under section 953(d) to be treated as a domestic corporation, such corporation shall be treated as a domestic corporation as to earnings and profits that were taken into account at the time of the section 953(d) election or which accrue after such election, and shall be treated as a foreign corporation as to earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1988. Thus, for example, if

the section 953(d) corporation subsequently transfers its assets to a domestic corporation (other than another section 953(d) corporation) in a transaction described in section 381(a), the rules of Sec. 1.367(b)-3 shall apply to such transaction to the extent of the section 953(d) corporation's earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 1504(d) elections. An election under section 1504(d), which permits certain foreign corporations to be treated as domestic corporations, is treated as a transfer of property to a domestic corporation and will generally constitute a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F). However, if an election under section 1504(d) is made with respect to a foreign corporation from the first day of the foreign corporation's existence, then the foreign corporation shall be treated as a domestic corporation, and the section 367(b) regulations will not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Sections 985 through 989--(1) Change in functional currency of a qualified business unit--(i) Rule. If, as a result of a section 367(b) exchange described in section 381(a), a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) (QBU) has a different functional currency determined under the rules of section 985(b) than it used prior to the transaction, then the QBU shall be deemed to have automatically changed its functional currency immediately prior to the transaction. A QBU that is deemed to change its functional currency pursuant to this paragraph (j) must make the adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Change in functional currency of a qualified business unit--(i) Rule. If, as a result of a section 367(b) exchange described in section 381(a), a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) (QBU) has a different functional currency determined under the rules of section 985(b) than it used prior to the transaction, then the QBU shall be deemed to have automatically changed its functional currency immediately prior to the transaction. A QBU that is deemed to change its functional currency pursuant to this paragraph (j) must make the adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If, as a result of a section 367(b) exchange described in section 381(a), a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) (QBU) has a different functional currency determined under the rules of section 985(b) than it used prior to the transaction, then the QBU shall be deemed to have automatically changed its functional currency immediately prior to the transaction. A QBU that is deemed to change its functional currency pursuant to this paragraph (j) must make the adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (j)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of FC1, a foreign corporation. FC1 owns and operates a qualified business unit (QBU) (B1) in France, whose functional currency is the euro. FC2, an unrelated foreign corporation, owns and operates a QBU (B2) in France, whose functional currency is the dollar. FC2 acquires FC1's assets (including B1) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C). As a part of the reorganization, B1 and B2 combine their operations into one QBU. Applying the rules of section 985(b), the functional currency of the combined operations of B1 and B2 is the euro.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. FC2's acquisition of FC1's assets is a section 367(b) exchange that is described in section 381(a). Because the functional currency of the combined operations of B1 and B2 after the exchange is the euro, B2 is deemed to have automatically changed its functional currency to the euro immediately prior to the section 367(b) exchange. B2 must make the adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Previously taxed earnings and profits--(i) Exchanging shareholder that is a United States person.

If an exchanging shareholder that is a United States person is a distributee in an exchange described in Sec. 1.367(b)-5(c) or (d), then immediately prior to the exchange, and solely for the purpose of computing exchange gain or loss under section 986(c), the exchanging shareholder shall be treated as receiving a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from the appropriate foreign corporation to the extent such shareholder has a diminished interest in such previously taxed earnings and profits after the exchange. The exchange gain or loss recognized under this paragraph (j)(2)(i) will increase or decrease the exchanging shareholder's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation, including for purposes of computing gain or loss realized with respect to the stock on the transaction. The exchanging shareholder's dollar basis with respect to each account of previously taxed income shall be increased or decreased by the exchange gain or loss recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exchanging shareholder that is a United States person. If an exchanging shareholder that is a United States person is required to include in income either the all earnings and profits amount or the section 1248 amount under the provisions of Sec. 1.367(b)-3 or 1.367(b)-4, then immediately prior to the exchange, and solely for the purpose of computing exchange gain or loss under section 986(c), the exchanging shareholder shall be treated as receiving a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from the appropriate foreign corporation that is attributable (under the principles of section 1248) to the exchanged stock. If an exchanging shareholder that is a United States person is a distributee in an exchange described in Sec. 1.367(b)-5(c) or (d), then immediately prior to the exchange, and solely for the purpose of computing exchange gain or loss under section 986(c), the exchanging shareholder shall be treated as receiving a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from the appropriate foreign corporation to the extent such shareholder has a diminished interest in such previously taxed earnings and profits after the exchange. The exchange gain or loss recognized under this paragraph (j)(2)(i) will increase or decrease the exchanging shareholder's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation, including for purposes of computing gain or loss realized with respect to the stock on the transaction. The exchanging shareholder's dollar basis with respect to each account of previously taxed income shall be increased or decreased by the exchange gain or loss recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation. If an exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation is required to include in income either the all earnings and profits amount or the section 1248 amount under the provisions of Sec. 1.367(b)-3 or 1.367(b)-4, then, immediately prior to

the exchange, the exchanging shareholder shall be treated as receiving a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from the appropriate foreign corporation that is attributable (under the principles of section 1248) to the exchanged stock. If an exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation is a distributee in an exchange described in Sec. 1.367(b)-5(c) or (d), then the exchanging shareholder shall be treated as receiving (immediately prior to the exchange) a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from the appropriate foreign corporation. Such distribution shall be measured by the extent to which the exchanging shareholder's direct or indirect United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) have a diminished interest in such previously taxed earnings and profits after the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other rules.

In applying the section 367(b) regulations, stock of a corporation that is owned by a foreign partnership, trust or estate shall be considered as owned proportionately by its partners, owners, or beneficiaries under the principles of Sec. 1.367(e)-1(b)(2). Stock owned by an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3 is owned directly by the owner of such entity. In applying Sec. 1.367(b)-5(b), the principles of Sec. 1.367(e)-1(b)(2) shall also apply to a domestic partnership, trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Additional definitions--(1) Foreign income taxes.

For purposes of this section (and for purposes of the other section 367(b) regulation provisions that specifically refer to this paragraph (b)(2)), the term United States shareholder means any shareholder described in section 951(b) (without regard to whether the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation), and also any shareholder described in section 953(c)(1)(A) (but only if the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 953(c)(1)(B) subject to the rules of section 953(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Income inclusion--(i) Inclusion of all earnings and profits amount.

Notwithstanding Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e), however, a deemed dividend from the foreign acquired corporation to an exchanging foreign corporate shareholder shall not qualify for the exception from foreign personal holding company income provided by section 954(c)(3)(A)(i), although it may qualify for the look-through treatment provided by section 904(d)(3) if the requirements of that section are met with respect to the deemed dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC has a value of $100, and DC has a basis of $30 in such stock. The all earnings and profits amount attributable to the FC stock owned by DC is $20, of which $15 is described in section 1248(a) and the remaining $5 is not (for example, because it accumulated prior to 1963). FC has a basis of $50 in its assets. In a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes all of its property to DC, and the FC stock held by DC is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, DC must include $20 in income as a deemed dividend from FC. Under section 337(a) FC does not recognize gain or loss in the assets that it distributes to DC, and under section 334(b), DC takes a basis of $50 in such assets. Because the requirements of section 902 are met, DC qualifies for a deemed paid foreign tax credit with respect to the deemed dividend that it receives from FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC has a value of $100, and DC has a basis of $30 in such stock. The all earnings and profits amount attributable to the FC stock owned by DC is $75. FC has a basis of $50 in its assets. In a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes all of its property to DC, and the FC stock held by DC is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, DC must include $75 in income as a deemed dividend from FC. Under section 337(a) FC does not recognize gain or loss in the assets that it distributes to DC, and under section 334(b), DC takes a basis of $50 in such assets. Because the requirements of section 902 are met, DC qualifies for a deemed paid foreign tax credit with respect to the deemed dividend that it receives from FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC, a domestic corporation, owns 80 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. DC has owned its 80 percent interest in FC since FC was incorporated. The remaining 20 percent of the outstanding stock of FC is owned by a person unrelated to DC (the minority shareholder). The stock of FC owned by DC has a value of $80, and DC has a basis of $24 in such stock. The stock of FC owned by the minority shareholder has a value of $20, and the minority shareholder has a basis of $18 in such stock. FC's only asset is land having a value of $100, and FC has a basis of $50 in the land. Gain on the land would not generate earnings and profits qualifying under section 1248(d) for an exclusion from earnings and profits for purposes of section 1248. FC has earnings and profits of $20 (determined under the rules of Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(2) (i) and (ii)), $16 of which is attributable to the stock owned by DC under the rules of Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(3). FC subdivides the land and distributes to the minority shareholder land with a value of $20 and a basis of $10. As part of the same transaction, in a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes the remainder of its land to DC, and the FC stock held by DC and the minority shareholder is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under section 336, FC must recognize the $10 of gain it realizes in the land it distributes to the minority shareholder, and under section 331 the minority shareholder recognizes its gain of $2 in the stock of FC. Such gain is included in income by the minority shareholder as a dividend to the extent provided in section 1248 if the minority shareholder is a United States person that is described in section 1248(a)(2). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(2)(iii), the $10 of gain recognized by FC increases its earnings and profits for purposes of computing the all earnings and profits amount and, as a result, $8 of such increase (80 percent of $10) is considered to be attributable to the FC stock owned by DC under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(3)(i)(A)(1). DC's all earnings and profits amount with respect to its stock in FC is $24 (the $16 of initial all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock held by DC, plus the $8 addition to such amount that results from FC's recognition of gain on the distribution to the minority shareholder). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, DC must include the $24 all earnings and profits amount in income as a deemed dividend from FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of DC2, a domestic corporation. DC1 also owns all of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC has a value of $100, and DC1 has a basis of $30 in such stock. The assets of FC have a value of $100. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock owned by DC1 is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC2 acquires all of the assets of FC solely in exchange for DC2 stock. FC distributes the DC2 stock to DC1, and the FC stock held by DC1 is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. DC1 must include $20 in income as a deemed dividend from FC under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Under section 361, FC does not recognize gain or loss in the assets that it transfers to DC2 or in the DC2 stock that it distributes to DC1, and under section 362(b) DC2 takes a basis in the assets that it acquires from FC equal to the basis that FC had therein. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) and section 358(a)(1), DC1 takes a basis of $50 (its $30 basis in the stock of FC, plus the $20 that was treated as a deemed dividend to DC1) in the stock of DC2 that it receives in exchange for the stock of FC. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(iii) and section 312(a), the earnings and profits of FC are reduced by the $20 deemed dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC1, a foreign corporation. FC1 owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC2 stock owned by FC1 is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to FC1 or FC2, acquires all of the assets and liabilities of FC2 pursuant to a State W merger. FC2 receives DC2 stock and distributes such stock to FC1. The FC2 stock held by FC1 is canceled, and FC2 ceases its separate legal existence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. FC1 must include $20 in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The deemed dividend is treated as a dividend for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code as provided in Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(2); however, under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section the deemed dividend cannot qualify for the exception from foreign personal holding company income provided by section 954(c)(3)(A)(i), even if the provisions of that section would otherwise have been met in the case of an actual dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, owns 99 percent of USP, a domestic partnership. The remaining 1 percent of USP is owned by a person unrelated to DC1. DC1 and USP each directly own 9 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation subject to the rule of section 953(c). In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC2, a domestic corporation, acquires all of the assets and liabilities of FC in exchange for DC2 stock. FC distributes to its shareholders DC2 stock, and the FC stock held by its shareholders is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. (A) DC1 and USP are United States persons that are exchanging shareholders in a transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section. As a result, DC1 and USP are subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this section if they qualify as United States shareholders as defined in paragraph

(b)(2) of this section. Alternatively, if they do not qualify as United States shareholders as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, DC1 and USP are subject to the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section defines the term United States shareholder to include any shareholder described in section 951(b) (without regard to whether the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation). A shareholder described in section 951(b) is a United States person that is considered to own, applying the rules of section 958(a) and 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a foreign corporation. Under section 958(b), the rules of section 318(a), as modified by section 958(b) and the regulations thereunder, apply so that, in general, stock owned directly or indirectly by a partnership is considered as owned proportionately by its partners, and stock owned directly or indirectly by a partner is considered as owned by the partnership. Thus, under section 958(b), DC1 is treated as owning its proportionate share of FC stock held by USP, and USP is treated as owning all of the FC stock held by DC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> DC1 and USP are United States persons that are exchanging shareholders in a transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section. As a result, DC1 and USP are subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this section if they qualify as United States shareholders as defined in paragraph

(b)(2) of this section. Alternatively, if they do not qualify as United States shareholders as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, DC1 and USP are subject to the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section defines the term United States shareholder to include any shareholder described in section 951(b) (without regard to whether the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation). A shareholder described in section 951(b) is a United States person that is considered to own, applying the rules of section 958(a) and 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a foreign corporation. Under section 958(b), the rules of section 318(a), as modified by section 958(b) and the regulations thereunder, apply so that, in general, stock owned directly or indirectly by a partnership is considered as owned proportionately by its partners, and stock owned directly or indirectly by a partner is considered as owned by the partnership. Thus, under section 958(b), DC1 is treated as owning its proportionate share of FC stock held by USP, and USP is treated as owning all of the FC stock held by DC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Accordingly, for purposes of determining whether DC1 is a United States shareholder under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, DC1 is considered as owning 99 percent of the 9 percent of FC stock held by USP. Because DC1 also owns 9 percent of FC stock directly, DC1 is considered as owning more than 10 percent of FC stock. DC1 is thus a United States shareholder of FC under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and, as a result, is subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. However, for purposes of determining DC1's all earnings and profits amount, DC1 is not treated as owning the FC stock held by USP. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(3), DC1's all earnings and profits amount is determined by reference to the 9 percent of FC stock that it directly owns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of determining whether USP is a United States shareholder under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, USP is considered as owning the 9 percent of FC stock held by DC1. Because USP also owns 9 percent of FC stock directly, USP is considered as owning more than 10 percent of FC stock. USP is thus a United States shareholder of FC under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and, as a result, is subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. However, for purposes of determining USP's all earnings and profits amount, USP is not treated as owning the FC shares held by DC1. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d)(3), USP's all earnings and profits amount is determined by reference to the 9 percent of FC stock that it directly owns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Recognition of exchange gain or loss with respect to capital.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, owns 5 percent of the outstanding

stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation subject to the rule of section 953(c). Persons unrelated to DC1 own the remaining 95 percent of the outstanding stock of FC. DC1 has owned its 5 percent interest in FC since FC was incorporated. DC1's stock in FC has a basis of $40,000 and a value of $100,000. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to DC1's stock in FC is $50,000. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC2, a domestic corporation, acquires all of the assets and liabilities of FC in exchange for DC2 stock. FC distributes DC2 stock to its shareholders, and the FC stock held by its shareholders is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternate result 1. If DC1 does not make the election described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, then the general rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies and DC1 must recognize its $60,000 gain in the FC stock. Under section 358(a)(1), DC1 has a $100,000 basis (its $40,000 basis in the FC stock, plus the $60,000 recognized gain) in the DC2 stock that it receives in exchange for its FC stock. Because DC1 is not a shareholder described in section 1248(a)(2), section 1248 does not apply to recharacterize any of DC1's gain as a dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternate result 2. If DC1 makes a valid election under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, then DC1 must include in income as a deemed dividend the $50,000 all earnings and profits amount with respect to its FC stock. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(3) and section 358(a)(1), DC1 has a $90,000 basis (its $40,000 basis in the FC stock, plus the $50,000 that was treated as a deemed dividend to DC1) in the DC2 stock that it receives in exchange for its FC stock. Because DC1 owns less than 10 percent of the voting stock of FC, DC1 does not qualify for a deemed paid foreign tax credit under section 902.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that DC1's stock in FC has a fair market value of $48,000 on the date DC1 receives the DC2 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC1's stock in FC has a fair market value of less than $50,000 on the date of the section 367(b) exchange, the de minimis exception of paragraph (c)(4) of this section applies. As a result, DC1 is not subject to the gain or income inclusion requirements of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Carryover of certain foreign taxes--(1) Rule. Excess foreign taxes under section 904(c) allowable to the foreign acquired corporation under section 906 shall carry over to the domestic acquiring corporation and become allowable under section 901, subject to the limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code (for example, sections 383, 904 and 907).

In a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes all of its property to DC, and the FC stock held by DC is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The liquidation of FC into DC is a section 367(b) exchange. Thus, DC is subject to the section 367(b) regulations, and must file a section 367(b) notice pursuant to Sec. 1.367(b)-1(c).

Thus, only a net operating loss or capital loss carryover that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (or that is attributable to a permanent establishment, in the context of an applicable United States income tax treaty) is eligible to be carried over under section 381.

DC, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC has a value of $100, and DC has a basis of $80 in such stock. The assets of FC are one parcel of land with a value of $60 and a basis of $30, and tangible depreciable assets with a value of $40 and a basis of $80. FC has no net operating loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock owned by DC is $30, of which $19 is described in section 1248(a) and the remaining $11 is not (for example, because it was earned prior to 1963). In a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes all of its property to DC, and the FC stock held by DC is canceled. Rather than including in income as a deemed dividend the all earnings and profits amount of $30 as provided in Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i), DC instead elects taxable exchange treatment under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. DC recognizes the $20 of gain it realizes on its stock in FC. Of this $20 amount, $19 is included in income by DC as a dividend pursuant to section 1248(a). (For the source of the remaining $1 of gain recognized by DC, see section 865. For the treatment of the $1 for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, see generally section 904(d)(2)(A)(i).) Because the transaction is described in section 332 and because the all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock held by DC ($30) exceeds by $10 the income recognized by DC ($20), the attribute reduction rules of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section apply. Accordingly, the $10 excess earnings and profits amount is applied to reduce the basis of the tangible depreciable assets of FC, beginning with those assets with the shortest class lives. Under section 337(a) FC does not recognize gain or loss in the assets that it distributes to DC, and under section 334(b) (which is applied taking into account the basis reduction prescribed by paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(3) of this section) DC takes a basis of $30 in the land and $70 in the tangible depreciable assets that it receives from FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.367(b)-4  Acquisition of foreign corporate stock or assets by a foreign corporation in certain nonrecognition transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to an acquisition by a foreign corporation (the foreign acquiring corporation) of the stock of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or of the stock or assets of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (in either case, the foreign acquired corporation). For rules applicable when, pursuant to section 304(a)(1), a foreign acquiring corporation is treated as acquiring the stock of a foreign acquired corporation in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies, see Sec. 1.367(b)-4T(e). For purposes of this section, the term triangular reorganization means a reorganization described in Sec. 1.358-6(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) (forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, reverse triangular merger, triangular B reorganization, and triangular G reorganization, respectively). In the case of a triangular reorganization other than a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the foreign acquiring corporation that acquires the assets or stock of the foreign acquired corporation, and the reference to controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is to the corporation that controls the surviving corporation. In the case of a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the entity that survives the merger, and the controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is the corporation that before the merger controls the merged corporation. In the case of a reverse triangular merger, this section applies if stock of the foreign surviving corporation is exchanged for stock of a foreign corporation in control of the merging corporation; in such a case, the foreign surviving corporation is treated as a foreign acquired corporation for purposes of this section. A foreign corporation

that undergoes a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) is treated as both the foreign acquired corporation and the foreign acquiring corporation for purposes of this section.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FC1 is a foreign corporation that is owned, directly and indirectly (applying the ownership rules of section 958), solely by foreign persons. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. Thus, under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(a) and (b), DC is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FC2, and FC2 is a controlled foreign corporation. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), FC1 acquires all of the assets and assumes all of the liabilities of FC2 in exchange for FC1 voting stock. The FC1 voting stock received does not represent more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of FC1's stock. FC2 distributes the FC1 stock to DC, and the FC2 stock held by DC is canceled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange. As a result, the exchange is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b) of this section, DC must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC2, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the voting stock of FC1, which is received by FC2 in exchange for its assets and distributed by FC2 to DC, represents more than 50 percent of the voting power of FC1's stock under the rules of section 957(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount, because FC1 is a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FC2 receives and distributes voting stock of FP, a foreign corporation that is in control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) of FC1, instead of receiving and distributing voting stock of FC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. For purposes of section 367(a), the transfer is an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). See Sec. 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(iv). Accordingly, DC's exchange of FC2 stock for FP stock under section 354 will be taxable under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with

Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder, as well as section 367(a). If FP and FC1 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a (direct or indirect) section 1248 shareholder immediately after the reorganization, then the section 367(b) result is the same as in Example 2--that is, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount. Under these circumstances, the amount of the gain recognition agreement would equal the amount of the gain realized on the indirect stock transfer. If FP or FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a (direct or indirect) section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange, then the section 367(b) result is the same as in Example 1--that is, DC must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC2, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged. Under these circumstances, the amount of the gain recognition agreement would equal the amount of the gain realized on the indirect stock transfer, less the $20 section 1248 amount inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that FC1 merges into FC2 in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). Pursuant to the reorganization, DC exchanges its FC2 stock for stock of FP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The result is similar to the result in Example 3. The transfer is an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). See Sec. 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(ii). Accordingly, DC's exchange of FC2 stock for FP stock will be taxable under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement. If DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder, as well as section 367(a). If FP and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the reorganization, then paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require DC to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock that was exchanged and the amount of the gain recognition agreement is the amount of gain realized on the indirect stock transfer. If FP or FC2 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange, then DC must include in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged. Under these circumstances, the gain recognition agreement would be the amount of gain realized on the indirect transfer, less the $20 section 1248 amount inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that USP, a domestic corporation, owns the controlling interest (within the meaning of section 368(c)) in FC1 stock. In addition, FC2 merges into FC1 in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). Pursuant to the reorganization, DC exchanges its FC2 stock for USP stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Because DC receives stock of a domestic corporation, USP, in the section 354 exchange, the transfer is not an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). Accordingly, the exchange will be subject only to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, because the stock received is stock of a domestic corporation (USP) and, immediately after the exchange, USP is a section 1248 shareholder of FC1 (the surviving corporation) and FC1 is a controlled foreign corporation, the exchange is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and DC is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock that was exchanged. See Sec. 1.367(b)-13(c) for the basis and holding period rules applicable to this transaction, which cause USP's adjusted basis and holding period in the stock of FC1 after the transaction to reflect the basis and holding period that DC had in its FC2 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of DC2, a domestic corporation. DC2 owns various assets, including all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC2 has a value of $100, and DC2 has a basis of $30 in the stock. The section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock held by DC2 is $20. DC2 does not own any stock other than the FC2 stock. FC1 is a foreign corporation that is unrelated to DC1, DC2, and FC2. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), FC1 acquires all of the assets of DC2 in exchange for the assumption of DC2's liabilities and voting stock of FC1 that represents 20% of the outstanding voting stock of FC1. DC2 distributes the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1), and the DC2 stock held by DC1 is canceled. The exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c) applies to the section 361 exchange. DC1 properly files a gain recognition agreement that satisfies the conditions of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8 to qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a) with respect to DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1. See Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e). FC1 is not a surrogate foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 7874) because DC1 does not hold at least 60% of the stock of FC1 by reason of holding stock of DC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. DC2, the exchanging shareholder, is a U.S. person and a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FC2, the foreign

acquired corporation. Whether DC2 is required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section depends on whether, immediately after DC2's section 361 exchange of the FC2 stock for FC1 stock (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)), FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If, immediately after the section 361 exchange (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)), FC1 and FC2 are both controlled foreign corporations as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder, then DC2 is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section because neither condition in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied. Alternatively, if immediately after the section 361 exchange (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)) either FC1 or FC2 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder, then, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, DC2 must include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock. For the treatment of DC2's transfer of assets other than the FC2 stock to FC1, see section 367(a)(1) and (a)(3) and the regulations under that section. Furthermore, because DC2's transfer of any other assets to FC1 is pursuant to a section 361 exchange, see section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7. If any of the assets transferred are intangible assets for purposes of section 367(d), see section 367(d). With respect to DC2's distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1), see section 1248(f)(1), and Sec. Sec. 1.1248(f)-1 and 1.1248(f)-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DC1, a domestic corporation, wholly owns DC2, a domestic corporation. The DC2 stock has a $100x fair market value, and DC1 has a basis of $30x in the stock. DC2's only asset is all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The FC2 stock has a $100x fair market value, and DC2 has a basis of $30x in the stock. There are $20x of earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock for purposes of section 1248. USP, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, DC2, and FC2, wholly owns FC1, a foreign corporation. In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC2 transfers all the FC2 stock to FC1 in exchange solely for voting stock of USP, and distributes the USP stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1). DC1 exchanges its DC2 stock for the USP stock under section 354. DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1 is described in section 361(a) and therefore, under section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7, is generally subject to section 367(a)(1). However, the exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c) applies to the section 361 exchange. In addition, DC1 is not required to adjust the basis of its USP stock (determined under section 358) under section 367(a)(5) and Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(3). DC1 properly files a gain recognition agreement that satisfies the conditions of Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8 to qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a) with respect to DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1. See Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which USP is a section 1248 shareholder because USP directly and indirectly owns all the FC1 stock and FC2 stock, respectively. Because DC2 receives stock of a domestic corporation (USP) in exchange for the FC2 stock and, immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which USP is a section 1248 shareholder, DC2's exchange of the FC2 stock for the USP stock is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(1)(iv) of this section. Therefore, DC2 is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount in the FC2 stock. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(2)(i) of this section, USP must apply the principles of Sec. 1.367(b)-13 to adjust the basis of its FC1 stock to preserve the section 1248 amount ($20x) in the FC2 stock. Under the principles of Sec. 1.367(b)-13, each share of FC1 stock held by USP after the exchange must be divided into portions, one portion attributable to the FC1 stock owned before the exchange and one portion attributable to the FC2 stock received in the exchange. The $30x basis in the FC2 stock and the $20x earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock before the exchange are attributable to the divided portions of the FC1 stock to which the FC2 stock relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receipt by exchanging shareholder of preferred or other stock in certain instances--(i) Rule.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FC1 is a foreign corporation. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation, and FC2 has no outstanding preferred stock. The value of FC2 is $100 and DC has a basis of $50 in the stock of FC2. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires all of the stock of FC2 and, in exchange, DC receives FC1 voting preferred stock that constitutes 10 percent of the voting stock of FC1 for purposes of section 902(a). Immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations and DC is a section 1248 shareholder of FC1 and FC2, so paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Pursuant to Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), the transfer is subject to both section 367(a) and section 367(b). Under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1), DC will not be subject to tax under section 367(a)(1) if it enters into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-8. Even though paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income by DC of the section 1248 amount, DC must nevertheless include the $20 section 1248 amount in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Thus, if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the amount is $30 (the $50 gain realized less the $20 recognized under section 367(b)). If DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement, it must include in income under section 367(a)(1) the $50 of gain realized ($20 of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248). Section 367(b) does not apply in such case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC1 immediately before the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Both section 367(a) and section 367(b) apply to the transfer. Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion of the section 1248 amount. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the transaction is outside the scope of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because FC1 and FC2 are, immediately before the transaction, members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of such paragraph). Thus, if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with Sec. 1.367(a)-8, the amount of such agreement is $50. As in Example 1, if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement, it must include in income $50, $20 of which will be treated as a dividend under section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FC1 is a foreign corporation. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires all of the stock of FC2 in exchange for FC1 voting stock that constitutes 10 percent of the voting stock of FC1 for purposes of section 902(a). The FC1 voting stock received by DC in the exchange carries voting rights in FC1, but by agreement of the parties the shares entitle the holder to dividends, amounts to be paid on redemption, and amounts to be paid on liquidation, that are to be determined by reference to the earnings or value of FC2 as of the date of such event, and that are affected by the earnings or value of FC1 only if FC1 becomes insolvent or has insufficient capital surplus to pay dividends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1), DC will not be subject to tax under section 367(a)(1) if it enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer of FC2 stock to FC1. Under Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder to the extent that it is not subject to tax under section 367(a)(1). Furthermore, even if DC would not otherwise be required to recognize income under this section, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate may nevertheless require that DC include the $20 section 1248 amount in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain recapitalizations.

Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC3 held by FC2 is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires from FC2 all of the stock of FC3 in exchange for FC1 voting stock. The FC1 voting stock received by FC2 does not represent more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of FC1's stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FC2 must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC3, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC3 stock that FC2 exchanged. The deemed dividend is treated as a dividend for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code as provided in Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(2); however, under this paragraph (c) the deemed dividend is not foreign personal holding company income to FC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules for subsequent sales or exchanges--(1) Rule.

DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of FC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to FC2 in exchange for 80% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to

section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), FC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5, FC (a controlled foreign corporation after the restructuring transaction) accumulates an additional $50 of earnings and profits. FC2, a controlled foreign corporation after the restructuring transaction, accumulates $100 of earnings and profits from January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 5, FC is liquidated into DC1 in a transaction described in section 332.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Generally, this paragraph (d) requires that DC1 include in income the earnings and profits attributable to its stock in FC as determined under Sec. 1.1248-8. However, since the liquidation of FC into DC1 is a transaction described in Sec. 1.367(b)-3, the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of FC are limited by Sec. 1.367(b)-2(d) (3)(ii) to that portion of the earnings and profits accumulated by FC itself before or after the restructuring transaction, and do not include the earnings and profits of FC's subsidiaries accumulated before or after the restructuring transaction. Thus, DC1 will include $40 of earnings and profits in income (80% of the $50 of earnings and profits accumulated by FC after the restructuring transaction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(b)-4T(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(b)-4T(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.367(b)-4T(g).

This section applies to the extent that, pursuant to section 304(a)(1), an exchanging shareholder is treated as transferring the stock of a foreign acquired corporation to a foreign acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies (deemed section 351 exchange).

USP, CFC1, CFC2 and CFC3 use a calendar taxable year. CFC1 owns 30% of the outstanding stock of FS, a foreign corporation. FP owns the remaining 70% of the outstanding stock of FS. The CFC2 stock has a

As of December 31, year 1, CFC2 has $20x of section 1248 earnings and profits, CFC3 has $40x of section 1248 earnings and profits, and FS has zero earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, in a transaction described in section 304(a)(1), CFC1 sells the CFC2 stock to FS for $100x cash.

The CFC2 stock has a

As of December 31, year 1, CFC2 has $20x of section 1248 earnings and profits, CFC3 has $40x of section 1248 earnings and profits, and FS has zero earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, in a transaction described in section 304(a)(1), CFC1 sells the CFC2 stock to FS for $100x cash. FS is not a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning section 957(a)) either before or after the sale of the CFC2 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Because CFC1 wholly owns CFC2 before the transaction and is treated, under section 318, as indirectly owning 100% of the CFC2 stock after the transaction, under section 304(a)(1), CFC2 and FS are treated as if CFC1 contributed the CFC2 stock to FS in a deemed section 351 exchange in exchange solely for $100x of FS stock, and then FS redeemed for $100x cash its stock deemed issued to CFC1. Because CFC1 wholly owned CFC2 before the transaction and is treated, under section 318, as indirectly owning 100% of CFC2 after the transaction, section 302(a) does not apply to the redemption. Instead, under section 302(d), the redemption is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies. Pursuant to section 304(b)(2), $20x of the distribution is treated as a dividend from the earnings and profits of CFC2. With respect to the remaining $80x, CFC1 takes the position that $40x is applied against and reduces the basis of the FS stock deemed issued in the transaction, and $40x is applied against and reduces the basis of the FS stock held by CFC1 prior to (and after) the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the transfer by CFC1 of the CFC2 stock to FS in the deemed section 351 exchange is subject to paragraph (b) of this section to the extent the distribution received by CFC1 in redemption of the FS stock issued in the deemed section 351 exchange is applied against and reduces, under section 301(c)(2), the basis of the FS stock held by CFC1 before (and after) the transaction. Thus, because $40x of the distribution received by CFC1 from FS in redemption of the FS stock issued in the deemed section 351 exchange is applied against and reduces, under section 301(c)(2), the basis of the FS stock held by CFC1 before (and after) the transaction, under paragraph (b) of this section, CFC1 must include $40x in income as a deemed dividend. See Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e) for the treatment of the $40x income inclusion. In total, CFC1 recognizes dividend income of $60x, $20x from the application of section 304(a)(1) to the sale of the CFC2 stock to FS and $40x under paragraph (b) of this section by reason of the application of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USS, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the outstanding stock of FD, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). USS has owned the stock since FD was incorporated, and FD has always been a CFC. USS has a basis of $80 in its FD stock, which has a fair market value of $200. FD owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. FD has owned the stock since FC was incorporated. Neither FD nor FC own stock in any other corporation. FD has earnings and profits of $0 and a fair market value of $250 (not considering its ownership of FC). FC has earnings and profits of $300, none of which is described in section 1248(d), and a fair market value of $250. In a pro rata distribution described in section 355, FD distributes to USS stock in FC worth $100; thereafter, USS's FD stock is worth $100 as well.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result--(A) FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, USS must compare its predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC to its respective postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is its section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution is $120, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD is $0, and its predistribution amount with respect to FC is $120. These amounts are computed as follows: If USS had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $120 of gain ($200 fair market value $80 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS's pro rata share of FC's earnings and profits (40 percent x $300)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, USS must compare its predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC to its respective postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is its section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution is $120, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD is $0, and its predistribution amount with respect to FC is $120. These amounts are computed as follows: If USS had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $120 of gain ($200 fair market value $80 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS's pro rata share of FC's earnings and profits (40 percent x $300)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, USS's postdistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is its section 1248 amount with

respect to such corporation, computed immediately after the distribution (but without regard to paragraph (c) of this section). Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS's section 1248 amounts computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FD and FC are $0 and $60, respectively. These amounts, which are USS's postdistribution amounts, are computed as follows: Under the normal principles of section 358, USS allocates its $80 predistribution basis in FD between FD and FC according to the stock blocks' relative values, yielding a $40 basis in each block. If USS sold its FD stock immediately after the distribution, none of the resulting gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248. If USS sold its FC stock immediately after the distribution, it would have a $60 gain ($100 fair market value--$40 basis), all of which would be treated as a dividend under section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The basis adjustment and income inclusion rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to the extent of any difference between USS's postdistribution and predistribution amounts. In the case of FD, there is no difference between the two amounts and, as a result, no adjustment or income inclusion is required. In the case of FC, USS's postdistribution amount is $60 less than its predistribution amount. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, USS is required to reduce its basis in its FC stock from $40 to $0 and include $20 in income as a deemed dividend. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(2), the $20 deemed dividend is considered as having been paid by FC to FD, and by FD to USS, immediately prior to the distribution. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the deemed dividend is not included by FD as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the basis increase provided in Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) does not apply with regard to the $20 deemed dividend. Under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, USS increases its basis in FD by the amount by which it decreased its basis in FC, as well as by the amount of its deemed dividend inclusion ($40 + $40 + $20 = $100).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USS1 and USS2, domestic corporations, each own 50 percent of the outstanding stock of FD, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). USS1 and USS2 have owned their FD stock since it was incorporated, and FD has always been a CFC. USS1 and USS2 each have a basis of $500 in their FD stock, and the fair market value of each block of FD stock is $750. FD owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. FD owned the stock since FC was incorporated. Neither FD nor FC own stock in any other corporation. FD has earnings and profits of $0 and a fair market value of $750 (not considering its ownership of FC). FC has earnings and profits of $500, none of which is described in section 1248(d), and a fair market value of $750. In a non-pro rata distribution described in section 355, FD distributes all of the stock of FC to USS2 in exchange for USS2's FD stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result--(A) FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, USS1 is considered a distributee of FD stock. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, USS1 and USS2 must compare their predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC stock to their respective postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS1's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is USS1's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. USS2's predistribution amount is determined in the same manner. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS1 and USS2 each have a section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution of $250, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS1 and USS2 each have a predistribution amount with respect to FD of $0, and each have a predistribution amount with respect to FC of $250. These amounts are computed as follows: If either USS1 or USS2 had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $250 of gain ($750 fair market value--$500 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS1's and USS2's pro rata shares of FC's earnings and profits (50 percent x $500)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, USS1 is considered a distributee of FD stock. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, USS1 and USS2 must compare their predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC stock to their respective postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS1's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is USS1's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. USS2's predistribution amount is determined in the same manner. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS1 and USS2 each have a section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution of $250, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS1 and USS2 each have a predistribution amount with respect to FD of $0, and each have a predistribution amount with respect to FC of $250. These amounts are computed as follows: If either USS1 or USS2 had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $250 of gain ($750 fair market value--$500 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS1's and USS2's pro rata shares of FC's earnings and profits (50 percent x $500)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a distributee that owns no stock in the distributing or controlled corporation immediately after the distribution has a postdistribution amount with regard to that stock of zero. Accordingly, USS2 has a postdistribution amount of $0 with respect to FD and USS1 has a postdistribution amount of $0 with respect to FC. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, USS1's postdistribution amount with respect to FD is its section 1248 amount with respect to such corporation, computed immediately after the distribution (but without regard to paragraph (d) of this section). USS2's postdistribution amount with respect to FC is determined in the same manner. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS1's section 1248 amount computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FD is $0 and USS2's section 1248 amount computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FC is $250. These amounts, which are USS1's and USS2's postdistribution amounts, are computed as follows: After the non-pro rata distribution, USS1 owns all the stock of FD and USS2 owns all the stock of FC. If USS1 sold its FD stock immediately after the distribution, none of the resulting $250 gain ($750 fair market value $500 basis) would be treated as a dividend under section 1248. If

USS2 sold its FC stock immediately after the distribution, it would have a $250 gain ($750 fair market value--$500 basis), all of which would be treated as a dividend under section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The income inclusion rule of paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to the extent of any difference between USS1's and USS2's postdistribution and predistribution amounts. In the case of USS2, there is no difference between the two amounts with respect to either FD or FC and, as a result, no income inclusion is required. In the case of USS1, there is no difference between the two amounts with respect to its FD stock. However, USS1's postdistribution amount with respect to FC is $250 less than its predistribution amount. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, USS1 is required to include $250 in income as a deemed dividend. Under Sec. 1.367(b)-2(e)(2), the $250 deemed dividend is considered as having been paid by FC to FD, and by FD to USS1, immediately prior to the distribution. This deemed dividend increases USS1's basis in FD ($500 + $250 = $750). Under paragraph (f) of this section, the deemed dividend is not included by FD as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c).

Sec. 1.367(b)-7  Carryover of earnings and profits and foreign income taxes in certain foreign-to-foreign nonrecognition transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to an acquisition by a foreign corporation (foreign acquiring corporation) of the assets of another foreign corporation (foreign target corporation) in a transaction described in section 381 (foreign section 381 transaction). This section describes the manner and extent to which earnings and profits and foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation carry over to the surviving foreign corporation (foreign surviving corporation) and the ordering of distributions by the foreign surviving corporation. See Sec. 1.367(b)-9 for special rules governing reorganizations described in section 368(a)(1)(F) and foreign section 381 transactions involving foreign corporations that hold no property and have no tax attributes immediately before the transaction, other than a nominal amount of assets (and related tax attributes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules--(1) Non-previously taxed earnings and profits and related taxes. Earnings and profits and related foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation (pre-transaction earnings and pre-transaction taxes, respectively) shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation in the manner described in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section. Dividend distributions by the foreign surviving corporation (post-transaction distributions) shall be out of earnings and profits and shall reduce related foreign income taxes in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-previously taxed earnings and profits and related taxes.

If immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction either the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation has a deficit in one or more separate categories of post-1986 undistributed earnings or an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, such deficit will be a hovering deficit of the foreign surviving corporation.

A hovering deficit in a separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings shall offset only earnings and profits accumulated by the foreign surviving corporation after the foreign section 381 transaction (post-transaction earnings) in the same separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings. For purposes of this rule, however, post-transaction earnings do not include post-1986 undistributed earnings in the same category that are earned after the foreign section 381 transaction, but are distributed or deemed distributed in the same year they are earned (that is, that do not become accumulated).

None of the shareholders of foreign corporations A and B are required to include any amount in income under Sec. 1.367(b)-4 as a result of the foreign section 381 transaction. Foreign corporations A and B (and all

of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a ``u'' functional currency. Finally, unless otherwise stated, any post-1986 undistributed earnings in the passive category resulted from a look-through dividend that was paid by a lower-tier CFC out of earnings accumulated when the CFC was a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and that qualified for the subpart F same-country exception under section 954(c)(3)(A).

For purposes of determining the dividend amount under section 316 and the foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to that dividend under section 902, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section the hovering deficit does not offset the post-transaction current year earnings. Accordingly, the full 75u will be a dividend under section 316. The deemed paid taxes on that dividend are $17 (75u distribution / (100u current earnings + 50u accumulated earnings) = 50%, x ($10 accumulated foreign taxes + $24 current year foreign taxes) = $17). The 25u of undistributed earnings and profits in 2007 will be offset by (25u) of the hovering deficit for purposes of determining the opening balance of the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool in 2008. Because the amount of earnings offset by the hovering deficit is 25% of the amount of the hovering deficit, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section $5 (25% of $20) of the related taxes are added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool at the beginning of the next taxable year.

Thus, 1,000u of the distribution is out of foreign corporation A's 2006 layer 1 and 250u is out of foreign corporation B's 2006 layer 2 (after rolling forward (50u) of the deficit in 2005 layer to reduce earnings in 2006 layer 1 to 250u (300u-50u)). Under the principles of Sec. 1.902-1(b)(3), all of the taxes in each of those respective layers are reduced. The remaining 50u is distributed from foreign corporation A's 2003 layer 1 (after rolling back the (200u) deficit in 2004 layer 1 to reduce earnings in 2003 layer 1 to 200u (400u-200u)).

The 100u of post-transaction earnings will be offset by (100u) of the hovering deficit for purposes of determining the opening balance of the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool in 2008.

Sec. 1.367(b)-10  Acquisition of parent stock or securities for property in triangular reorganizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Scope. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, this section applies to a triangular reorganization if P or S (or both) is a foreign corporation and, in connection with the reorganization, S acquires in exchange for property all or a portion of the P stock or P securities (P acquisition) that are used to acquire the stock, securities or property of T in the triangular reorganization. This section applies to a triangular reorganization regardless of whether P controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, this section applies to a triangular reorganization if P or S (or both) is a foreign corporation and, in connection with the reorganization, S acquires in exchange for property all or a portion of the P stock or P securities (P acquisition) that are used to acquire the stock, securities or property of T in the triangular reorganization. This section applies to a triangular reorganization regardless of whether P controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. This section shall not apply if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P and S are foreign corporations and neither P nor S is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.367(b)-2(a)) immediately before or immediately after the triangular reorganization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S is a domestic corporation, P's stock in S is not a United States real property interest (within the meaning of section 897(c)), and P would not be subject to U.S. tax on a dividend (as determined under section 301(c)(1)) from S under either section 881 (for example, by reason of an applicable treaty) or section 882; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In an exchange under section 354 or 356, one or more U.S. persons exchange stock or securities of T and the amount of gain in the T stock or securities recognized by such U.S. persons under section 367(a)(1) is equal to or greater than the sum of the amount of the deemed distribution that would be treated by P as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) and the amount of such deemed distribution that would be treated by P as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3) if this section would otherwise apply to the triangular reorganization.

See Sec. 1.367(a)-3(a)(2)(iv) (providing a similar rule that excludes certain transactions from the application of section 367(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The terms P, S, and T have the meanings set forth in Sec. 1.358-6(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term property has the meaning set forth in section 317(a), except that the term property also includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A liability assumed by S to acquire the P stock or securities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> S stock (or any rights to acquire S stock) to the extent such S stock (or rights to acquire S stock) is used by S to acquire P stock or securities from a person other than P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term security means an instrument that constitutes a security for purposes of section 354 or 356.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term triangular reorganization has the meaning set forth in Sec. 1.358-6(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules--(1) Deemed distribution. If this section applies, adjustments shall be made that have the effect of a distribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) from S to P under section 301 (deemed distribution). The amount of the deemed distribution shall equal the sum of the amount of money transferred by S, the amount of any liabilities that are assumed by S and constitute property, and the fair market value of other property transferred by S in the P acquisition in exchange for the P stock or P securities described in paragraph (i) or (ii), respectively, of this paragraph (b)(1)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deemed distribution. If this section applies, adjustments shall be made that have the effect of a distribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) from S to P under section 301 (deemed distribution). The amount of the deemed distribution shall equal the sum of the amount of money transferred by S, the amount of any liabilities that are assumed by S and constitute property, and the fair market value of other property transferred by S in the P acquisition in exchange for the P stock or P securities described in paragraph (i) or (ii), respectively, of this paragraph (b)(1)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P stock received by T shareholders or securityholders in an exchange to which section 354 or 356 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P securities received by T shareholders or securityholders to the extent such securities are ``other property'' (within the meaning of section 356(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deemed contribution. If this section applies, adjustments shall be made that have the effect of a contribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) by P to S in an amount equal to the amount of the deemed distribution from S to P under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (deemed contribution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing of deemed distribution and deemed contribution. If P controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition, the adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section shall be made as if the deemed distribution and deemed contribution, respectively, are separate transactions occurring immediately before the P acquisition. If P does not control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition, the adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section shall be made as if the deemed distribution and deemed contribution, respectively, are separate transactions occurring immediately after P acquires control of S, but prior to the triangular reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of other provisions. Nothing in this section shall prevent the application of other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code from applying to the P acquisition. For example, section 304 may apply to the P acquisition. Furthermore, section 1001 or 267 may apply to S's transfer of property to acquire P stock or securities from P or a person other than P. In addition, generally applicable provisions that apply to triangular reorganizations, such as Sec. 1.358-6 and Sec. 1.1032-2, shall apply to the triangular reorganization in a manner consistent with S acquiring the P stock or securities in exchange for property from P or a person other than P, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P, a publicly traded domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a foreign corporation, and all of the outstanding stock of US1, a domestic corporation that is a member of the P consolidated group. US1 owns all of the outstanding stock of FT, a foreign corporation, the fair market value of which is $100x. US1's basis in the FT stock is $100x, such that there is a no built-in gain or loss in the FT stock. FS has earnings and profits in excess of $100x. FS purchases $100x of P stock from the public on the open market in exchange for $100x of cash. Pursuant to foreign law, FT merges with and into FS in a triangular reorganization that qualifies

under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D). In an exchange to which section 354 applies, US1 exchanges all the outstanding stock of FT for the $100x of P stock purchased by FS on the open market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The triangular reorganization is described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P is a domestic corporation and FS is a foreign corporation. In connection with FS purchasing the $100x of P stock in exchange for property (cash), FS uses the P stock to acquire the FT property in a triangular reorganization, and US1 receives the P stock in an exchange to which section 354 applies. Furthermore, none of the exceptions of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, adjustments are made that have the effect of a deemed distribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) in the amount of $100x from FS to P under section 301. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, adjustments are made that have the effect of a deemed contribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) in the amount of $100x by P to FS. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are made as if the deemed distribution and deemed contribution, respectively, are separate transactions occurring immediately before FS's purchase of the P stock on the open market. Generally applicable provisions apply to FS's purchase of the P stock on the open market (see, for example, section 304) and in determining certain tax consequences to P and FS as a result of the triangular reorganization (see, for example, Sec. 1.358-6(d) and Sec. 1.1032-2(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Collateral adjustments. This paragraph (c) provides additional rules that apply by reason of the deemed distribution and deemed contribution described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deemed distribution. A deemed distribution described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be treated as occurring for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, the ordering rules of section 301(c) apply to characterize the deemed distribution to P as a dividend from the earnings and profits of S, return of stock basis, or gain from the sale or exchange of property, as the case may be. Furthermore, sections 902 or 959 may apply to the deemed distribution if S is a foreign corporation, and sections 881, 882, 897, 1442, or 1445 may apply to the deemed distribution if S is a domestic corporation. Appropriate corresponding adjustments shall be made to S's earnings and profits consistent with the principles of section 312.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deemed contribution. A deemed contribution described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be treated as occurring for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, appropriate adjustments shall be made to P's basis in the S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Anti-abuse rule. Appropriate adjustments shall be made pursuant to this section if, in connection with a triangular reorganization, a transaction is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section. For example, if S is created, organized, or funded to avoid the application of this section with respect to the earnings and profits of a corporation related (within the meaning of section 267(b)) to P or S, the earnings and profits of S will be deemed to include the earnings and profits of such related corporation for purposes of determining the consequences of the adjustments provided in this section, and appropriate corresponding adjustments will be made to account for the application of this section to the earnings and profits of such related corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to triangular reorganizations occurring on or after May 17, 2011. For triangular reorganizations that occur prior to May 17, 2011, see Sec. 1.367(b)-14T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2011.

(A) US1, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of F1, a foreign corporation. F1 owns all the stock of FT, a foreign corporation, with 100 shares of stock outstanding. Each share of FT stock is valued at $10x. Because F1 acquired the stock of FT at two different dates, F1 owns two blocks of FT stock for purposes

of section 1248. The first block consists of 60 shares. The shares in the first block have a basis of $300x ($5x per share), a holding period of 10 years, and $240x ($4x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to the shares for purposes of section 1248. The second block consists of 40 shares. The shares in the second block have a basis of $600x ($15x per share), a holding period of 2 years, and $80x ($2x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to the shares for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> US1, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of F1, a foreign corporation. F1 owns all the stock of FT, a foreign corporation, with 100 shares of stock outstanding. Each share of FT stock is valued at $10x.

The shares in the second block have a basis of $600x ($15x per share), a holding period of 2 years, and $80x ($2x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to the shares for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> US2, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FP, a foreign corporation, which owns all of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. FP owns two blocks of FS stock. Each block consists of 10 shares with a value of $200x ($20x per share). The shares in the first block have a basis of $50x ($5x per share), a holding period of 10 years, and $50x ($5x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to such shares for purposes of section 1248. The shares in the second block had a basis of $100x ($10x per share), a holding period of 5 years, and $20x ($2x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to such shares for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> FT merges into FS, with FS surviving, and F1 receives 50 shares of FP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock. The merger of FT into FS qualifies as forward triangular merger, and immediately after the exchange US1 is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP and FS, all of which are controlled foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period determination. (1) US1 is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, the exchanging shareholder, and FT (both of which are controlled foreign corporations) immediately before the transaction. Moreover, F1 is not required to include amounts in income under Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b) or 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT stock held by F1 immediately before the exchange (the FT portion). The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock in the first block has a portion with a basis of $5x, a value of $20x, a holding period of 10 years, and $5x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FS stock in the second block has a portion with a basis of $10x, a value of $20x, a holding period of 5 years, and $2x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (F1) has a section 1248 shareholder (US1), the holding period and basis of the FT portion is the holding period and the proportionate amount of the basis of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such portion relates. Further, because F1 exchanged two blocks of FT stock, the FT portion must be divided into two separate portions attributable to the two blocks of FT stock. Thus, each share of FS stock will have a second portion with a basis of $15x ($300x basis / 20 shares), a value of $30x ($600x value / 20 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $12x of earnings and profits ($240x / 20 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FS stock will have a third portion with a basis of $30x ($600x basis / 20 shares), a value of $20x ($400x value / 20 shares), a holding period of 2 years, and $4x of earnings and profits ($80x / 20 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent disposition--first block. Assume, immediately after the transaction, FP disposes of a share of FS stock from the first block. When FP disposes of any share of its FS stock, it is treated as disposing of each divided portion of such share. With respect to the first portion (attributable to the FS stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($20x value - $5x basis), $5x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the second portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($30x value - $15x basis), $12x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the third portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock), FP recognizes a capital loss of $10x ($20x value - $30x basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Subsequent disposition--second block. Assume further, immediately after the transaction, FP also disposes of a share of stock from the second block of FS stock. With respect to the first portion (attributable to the FS stock), FP recognizes a gain of $10x ($20x value - $10x basis), $2x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the second portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($30x value - $15x basis), $12x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the third portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock), FP recognizes a capital loss of $10x ($20x value - $30x basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FS merges into FT with FT surviving in a reverse triangular merger. Pursuant to the merger, F1 receives FP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock, and FP receives 10 shares of FT stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange

for its FS stock. Immediately after the exchange, US1 is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP, and FT, all of which are controlled foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period determination--(A) The basis and holding period of the stock of the surviving corporation held by FP are the same as in Example 1, except that each share of the surviving corporation (FT, instead of FS) will be divided into four portions instead of three portions.

Because F1 exchanges two blocks of FT stock, the FT portion must be divided into two separate portions attributable to the two blocks of FT stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Thus, each share of the surviving corporation (FT) will have a first portion (attributable to the first block of FS stock) with a basis of $5x ($50x / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x / 10 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $5x of earnings and profits ($50x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FT stock will have a second portion (attributable to the second block of FS stock) with a basis of $10x ($100x / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x / 10 shares), a holding period of 5 years, and $2x of earnings and profits ($20x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Moreover, each share of FT stock will have a third portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock) with a basis of $30x ($300x basis / 10 shares), a value of $60x ($600x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $24x of earnings and profits ($240x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Lastly, each share of FT stock will have a fourth portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock) with a basis of $60x ($600x basis / 10 shares), a value of $40x ($400x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 2 years, and $8x of earnings and profits ($80x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of FS, a foreign corporation with 10 shares of stock outstanding. Each share of FS stock has a value of $10x, a basis of $5x, a holding period of 10 years, and $7x of earnings and profits attributable to such share for purposes of section 1248. FP, a foreign corporation, owns the stock of FT, another foreign corporation. FP and FT do not have any section 1248 shareholders. FT has assets with a value of $100x, a basis of $50x, and no liabilities. The FT stock held by FP has a value of $100x and a basis of $75x. FT merges into FS with FS surviving in a forward triangular merger. Pursuant to the reorganization, FP receives USP stock with a value of $100x in exchange for its FT stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period determination--(A) Because USP is a section 1248 shareholder of FS immediately before the transaction, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Because USP is a section 1248 shareholder of FS immediately before the transaction, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT portion immediately before the exchange. Because FT does not have a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the transaction, the rules of Sec. 1.358-6 apply to determine the basis of the FT portion of each share of FS stock. Those rules determine the basis of FS stock held by USP by reference to the basis of FT's net assets. The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock has a portion with a basis of $5x, a value of $10x, a holding period of 10 years, and $7x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for section 1248 purposes. The basis of the FT portion is the basis of the FT assets to which such portion relates. Thus, each share of FS stock has a second portion with a basis of $5x ($50x basis in FT's assets / 10 shares) and a value of $10x ($100x value of FT's assets / 10 shares). All of FS's earnings and profits prior to the transaction ($70x) is attributed solely to the FS portion in each share of FS stock. As a result of each share of stock being divided into portions, the basis of the FS stock is not averaged with the basis of the FT assets to increase the section 1248 amount with respect to the stock of the surviving corporation (FS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. US, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. The FT stock held by US constitutes a single block of stock with a value of $1,000x, a basis of $600x, and holding period of 5 years. USP, a domestic corporation, forms FS, a foreign corporation, pursuant to the plan of reorganization and capitalizes it with $10x of cash. FS merges into FT with FT surviving in a reverse triangular merger and a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B). Pursuant to the reorganization, US receives USP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock, and USP receives 10 shares of FT stock with a value of $1,010x in exchange for its FS stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period determination.

The basis and holding period of the

FT stock held by USP is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (US) is a section 1248 shareholder of FT, each share of the surviving corporation (FT) has a proportionate amount of the basis and holding period of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such share relates. Thus, the portion of each share of FT stock attributable to the FT stock has a basis of $60x ($600x basis / 10 shares), a value of $100x ($1,000x value / 10 shares), and a holding period of 5 years. Because the value of FS stock immediately before the triangular reorganization ($10x) is less than one percent of the value of the surviving corporation (FT) immediately after the triangular reorganization ($1,010x), USP may determine its basis in the stock of the surviving corporation (FT) attributable to its FS stock basis held prior to the reorganization by increasing the basis of each share of FT stock by the proportionate amount of USP's aggregate basis in the FS stock immediately before the exchange (without dividing each share of FT stock into separate portions to account for FS and FT). If USP so elects, USP's basis in each share of FT stock is increased by $1x ($10x basis in FS stock / 10 shares). As a result, each share of FT stock has a basis of $61x, a value of $101x, and a holding period of 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. US, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of F1, a foreign corporation, which owns all the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. The FT stock held by F1 constitutes one block of stock with a basis of $170x, a value of $200x, a holding period of 5 years, and $10x of earnings and profits attributable to such stock for purposes of section 1248. FP, a foreign corporation, owns all the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. FS has 10 shares of stock outstanding. No United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FP or FS. The FS stock held by FP has a value of $100x and a basis of $50x ($5x per share). FT merges into FS with FS surviving in a forward triangular merger. Pursuant to the merger, F1 receives FP stock with a value of $200x for its FT stock in an exchange that qualifies for non-recognition under section 354. US is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP, and FS (all of which are controlled foreign corporations) immediately after the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period determination. (A) Because US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, the exchanging shareholder, and FT immediately before the transaction, and US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, FP, and FS immediately after the transactions, F1 is not required to include amounts in income under Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b) and 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Because US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, the exchanging shareholder, and FT immediately before the transaction, and US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, FP, and FS immediately after the transactions, F1 is not required to include amounts in income under Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-3(b) and 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT stock held by F1 immediately before the exchange (the FT portion). The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock has a portion with a basis of $5x and a value of $10x. Because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (F1) has a section 1248 shareholder of both F1 and FT, the basis and holding period of the FT portion is the proportionate amount of the basis and the holding period of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such portion relates. Thus, each share of FS stock will have a second portion with a basis of $17x ($170x basis / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 5 years, and $1x of earnings and profits ($10x earnings and profits / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent disposition.

Immediately before the merger, the value of the FS stock in relation to the value of both the FS stock and the FT stock was one-third ($100x / ($100x plus $200x)). Likewise, immediately before the merger, the value of the FT stock in relation to the value of both the FT stock and the FS stock was two-thirds ($200x / $100x plus $200x). Accordingly, one-third of the $210x amount realized is allocated to the FS portion of each share and two-thirds to the FT portion of each share. Thus, the amount realized allocated to the FS portion of each share is $7x (one-third of $210x divided by 10 shares). The amount realized allocated to the FT portion of each share is $14x (two-thirds of $210x divided by 10 shares).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, any earnings and profits (or deficits) accumulated by the surviving corporation

Thus, the deficit in earnings and profits allocated to the FS portion of each share is $1x (one-third of $30x divided by 10 shares). The deficit in earnings and profits allocated to the FT portion of each share is $2x (two-thirds of $30x divided by 10 shares).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When FP disposes of its FS stock, FP is treated as disposing of each divided portion of a share of stock.

With respect to the FT portion of each share of stock, FP recognizes a loss of $3x ($14x value - $17x basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.367(d)-1T  Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides rules under section 367(d) concerning transfers of intangible property by U.S. persons to foreign corporations pursuant to section 351 or 361. Paragraph (b) of this section specifies the transfers that are subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section, while paragraph (c) provides rules concerning the consequences of such a transfer. In general, the U.S. transferor will be treated as receiving annual payments contingent on productivity or use of the transferred property, over the useful life of the property (regardless of whether such payments are in fact made by the transferee). Paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section provide rules for cases in which there is a later direct or indirect disposition of the intangible property transferred. In general, deemed annual license payments will continue if a transfer is made to a related person, while gain must be recognized immediately if the transfer is to an unrelated person. Paragraph (g) of this section provides several special rules, including a rule allowing appropriate adjustments where deemed payments under section 367(d) are not in fact received by the U.S. transferor of the intangible property, and a rule providing for a limited election to treat certain transfers of intangible property as sales at fair market value (in lieu of applying the general useful life-contingent payment rule). In addition, paragraph (g) of this section provides rules coordinating the application of section 367(d) with other relevant Code sections. Paragraph (h) of this section defines the term related person for purposes of this section. Finally, paragraph (i) of this section provides the effective date of this section. For rules concerning transfers of intangible property pursuant to section 332, see Sec. 1.367(a)-5T(e). For purposes of determining whether a U.S. person has made a transfer of intangible property that is subject to the rules of section 367(d), the rules of Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(c) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intangible property subject to section 367(d). Section 367(d) and the rules of this section shall apply to the transfer of any intangible property, as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(d)(5)(i). However, section 367(d) and the rules of this section shall not apply to the transfer of foreign goodwill or going concern value, as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(d)(5)(iii), or to the transfer of intangible property described in Sec. 1.367(a)-5T(b)(2). However, the transfer of those items to a foreign corporation is subject to the rules set forth in Sec. 1.367(a)-6T, and the transfer of intangible property described in Sec. 1.367(a)-5T(b)(2) is subject to the rules set forth in Sec. 1.367(a)-5T. For a special rule relating to the transfer of operating intangibles, as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-1T(d)(5)(ii), see paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations pursuant to section 351 or 361 are subject to the rules of this section regardless of whether the property is to be used in the United States, in connection with goods to be sold or consumed in the United States, or in connection with a trade or business outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deemed payments upon transfer of intangible property to foreign corporation--(1) In general. If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, then such person shall be treated as having transferred that property in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property. Such person shall, over the useful life of the property, annually include in gross income an amount that represents an appropriate arms-length charge for the use of the property. The appropriate charge shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 482 and regulations thereunder. See Sec. 1.482-2(d). The amount of the deemed payment thus calculated shall be reduced by any royalty or other periodic payment made or accrued by the transferee to an unrelated person during that taxable year for the right to use the intangible property. Amounts so included in the transferor's income shall be treated as ordinary income from sources within the United States. For purposes of computing estimated tax payments, deemed payments under this paragraph (c) shall be treated as received by the transferor on the last day of its taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, then such person shall be treated as having transferred that property in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property.

Amounts so included in the transferor's income shall be treated as ordinary income from sources within the United States. For purposes of computing estimated tax payments, deemed payments under this paragraph (c) shall be treated as received by the transferor on the last day of its taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required adjustments. The following adjustments shall be made with respect to a U.S. person's recognition of a deemed payment for the use of intangible property under this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the earnings and profits of the transferee foreign corporation shall be reduced by the amount of such deemed payment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of subpart F of part III of subchapter N of the Code, the transferee foreign corporation may treat such deemed payment as an expense (whether or not that amount is actually paid), properly allocated and apportioned to gross income subject to subpart F, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.954-1(c) and 1.861-8.
No other special adjustments to earning the profits, basis, or gross income shall be permitted by reason of the recognition of a deemed payment under this paragraph (c). However, see paragraph (g)(1) of this section for rules permitting the establishment of an account receivable with respect to deemed payments not actually received by the U.S. person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Useful life. For purposes of this section, the useful life of intangible property is the entire period during which the property has value. However, in no event shall the useful life of an item of intangible property be considered to exceed twenty years. If intangible property derives its value from secrecy or from protections afforded by law, the useful life of such property shall terminate when the property is no longer secret or no longer legally protected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Blocked income. No deemed payment included in a taxpayer's income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be treated as deferrable income for purposes of applying rules relating to blocked foreign income. See Revenue Ruling 74-351, 1974-2 C.B. 144.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subsequent transfer of stock of transferee foreign corporation to unrelated person--(1) Treatment as sale of intangible property. If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, and within the useful life of the intangible property that U.S. transferor subsequently disposes of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation to a person that is not a related person (within the meaning of paragraph (h) of this section), then the U.S. transferor shall be treated as having simultaneously sold the intangible property to the person acquiring the stock of the transferee foreign corporation. The U.S. transferor shall be required to recognize gain (but not loss) from sources within the United States in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the transferred intangible property on the date of the subsequent disposition and the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in that property (determined as of the original transfer). If the U.S. transferor's disposition of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation is subject to U.S.

If a U.S. person transfers stock of a transferee foreign corporation to a U.S. related person in a transaction that is subject to

A U.S. person shall be presumed to have transferred intangible property for a principal purpose of avoiding the effect of section 367(d) if the property is transferred to the domestic corporation less than two years prior to the transfer of the stock of that domestic corporation to a foreign corporation. The presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by clear evidence that the subsequent transfer of the stock of the domestic transferee corporation was not contemplated at the time the intangible property was transferred to that corporation and that avoidance of section 367(d) and the rules of this section was not a principal purpose of the transaction. A transfer may have more than one principal purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Related person.

Sec. 1.367(e)-1  Distributions described in section 367(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides rules for recognition (and nonrecognition) of gain by a domestic corporation (distributing corporation) on a distribution of stock or securities of a corporation (controlled corporation) to foreign persons that is described in section 355. Paragraph (b) of this section contains the general rule that gain is recognized on the distribution to the extent stock or securities of controlled are distributed to foreign persons. Paragraph (c) of this section provides an exception to the gain recognition rule for distributions of stock or securities of a domestic corporation. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules for determining whether distributees of stock or securities in a section 355 distribution are qualified U.S. persons. Paragraph (e) of this section provides cross-references. Finally, paragraph (f) of this section specifies the effective date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gain recognition--(1) General rule. If a domestic corporation makes a distribution of stock or securities of a corporation that qualifies for nonrecognition under section 355 to a person who is not a qualified U.S. person, then, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the distributing corporation shall recognize gain (but not loss) on the distribution under section 367(e)(1). A distributing corporation shall not recognize gain under this section with respect to a section 355 distribution to a qualified U.S. person. For purposes of this section, a qualified U.S. person is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A citizen or resident of the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock owned through partnerships, disregarded entities, trusts, and estates. For purposes of this section, distributing corporation stock or securities owned by or for a partnership (whether foreign or domestic) are owned proportionately by its partners. A partner's proportionate share of the stock or securities of the distributing corporation shall be equal to the partner's distributive share of the gain that would have been recognized had the partnership sold the stock or securities (at a taxable gain) immediately before the distribution. The partner's distributive share of gain shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this section, stock or securities owned by or for an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (disregarded entity) under Sec. 301.7701-3 of this chapter are owned directly by the owner of such disregarded entity. For purposes of this section, stock or securities owned by or for a trust or estate (whether foreign or domestic) are owned proportionately by the persons who would be treated as owning such stock or securities under section 318(a)(2)(A) and (B). In applying section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), if a trust includes interests that are not actuarially ascertainable, all such interests shall be considered to be owned by foreign persons. In a case where an interest holder in a partnership, a disregarded entity, trust, or estate that (directly or indirectly) owns stock of the distributing corporation is itself a partnership, disregarded entity, trust, or estate, the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) apply to such interest holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gain computation. Gain recognized under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock or securities distributed to persons who are not qualified U.S. persons (determined as of the time of the distribution) over the distributing corporation's adjusted basis in the stock or securities distributed to such distributees. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the distributing corporation's adjusted basis in each unit of each class of stock or securities distributed to a distributee shall be equal to the distributing corporation's total adjusted basis in all of the units of the respective class of stock or securities owned immediately before the distribution, divided by the total number of units of the class of stock or securities owned immediately before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of distributee. If the distribution otherwise qualifies for nonrecognition under section 355, each distributee shall be considered to have received stock or securities in a distribution qualifying for nonrecognition

under section 355, even though the distributing corporation may recognize gain on the distribution under this section. Thus, the distributee shall not be considered to have received a distribution described in section 301 or a distribution in an exchange described in section 302(b) upon the receipt of the stock or securities of the controlled corporation, and the domestic distributing corporation shall have no withholding responsibilities under section 1441. Except where section 897(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder cause gain to be recognized by the distributee, the basis of the distributed domestic or foreign corporation stock in the hands of the foreign distributee shall be the basis of the distributed stock determined under section 358 without any increase for any gain recognized by the domestic corporation on the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonrecognition of gain. A domestic distributing corporation shall not recognize gain under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the distribution of stock or securities of a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determining whether distributees are qualified U.S. persons--(1) General rule--presumption of foreign status. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, all distributions of stock or securities in a distribution described in section 355 in which the distributing corporation is domestic and the controlled corporation is foreign are presumed to be to persons who are not qualified U.S. persons, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule--presumption of foreign status. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, all distributions of stock or securities in a distribution described in section 355 in which the distributing corporation is domestic and the controlled corporation is foreign are presumed to be to persons who are not qualified U.S. persons, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-publicly traded distributing corporations. If the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) is not regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), then the distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section by identifying the qualified U.S. persons to which controlled corporation stock or securities were distributed and by certifying the amount of stock or securities that were distributed to the qualified U.S. persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Publicly traded distributing corporations. If the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), then the distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as described in this paragraph (d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Five percent shareholders. A publicly traded distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to distributees that are five percent shareholders of the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) by identifying the qualified U.S. persons to which controlled corporation stock or securities were distributed and by certifying the amount of stock or securities that were distributed to the qualified U.S. persons. A five percent shareholder is a distributee who is required under U.S. securities laws to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a Schedule 13D or 13G under 17 CFR 240.13d-1 or 17 CFR 240.13d-2, and provide a copy of same to the distributing corporation under 17 CFR 240.13d-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other distributees. A distributing corporation that has made a distribution described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to distributees that are not five percent shareholders (as defined in this paragraph (d)(3)) by relying on and providing a reasonable analysis of shareholder records and other relevant information that demonstrates a number of distributees that are qualified U.S. persons. Taxpayers may rely on such analysis, unless it is subsequently determined that there are actually fewer distributees who are qualified U.S. persons than were demonstrated in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified exchange or other market. For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term qualified exchange or

other market means, for any taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A national securities exchange which is registered with the SEC or the national market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A foreign securities exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located and which has the following characteristics--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, and other requirements designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and to protect investors; and the laws of the country in which the exchange is located and the rules of the exchange ensure that such requirements are actually enforced; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rules of the exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Cross-references. For additional rules relating to the distribution of the stock of a foreign corporation by a domestic corporation, see Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3T(e), 1.367(a)-7, 1.367(b)-5, and 1.1248(f)-1 through 1.1248(f)-3. See the regulations under section 6038B for reporting requirements for distributions under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section shall be applicable to distributions occurring in taxable years ending after August 8, 1999.

Sec. 1.367(e)-2  Distributions described in section 367(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope--(1) In general. This section provides rules requiring gain and loss recognition by a corporation on its distribution of property to a foreign corporation in a complete liquidation described in section 332. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section contains the general rule that gain and loss are recognized when a domestic corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic corporation.

If a domestic corporation (domestic liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (foreign distributee corporation) that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic liquidating corporation, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule--(i) Recognition of gain and loss.

Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, the rules contained in section 336 will apply to the gain and loss recognized pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Overall loss limitation--(1) Overall loss limitation rule. Loss in excess of gain from the distribution shall not be recognized. If realized losses exceed recognized losses, the losses shall be recognized on a pro rata basis with respect to the realized loss attributable to each distributed loss asset in the category of assets (i.e., capital or ordinary) to which the realized but unrecognized loss relates. For additional limitations on the recognition of losses, see, e.g., section 1211.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the overall loss limitation rule, the pro rata loss allocation method, and the general capital loss limitation rule in section 1211(a):</p><p class="depth0">Example. F, a foreign corporation, owns all stock of US1, a domestic corporation. US1 owns the following capital assets: Asset A, which has a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $40; Asset B, which has a fair market value of $60 and an adjusted basis of $80; and, Asset C, which has a fair market value of $40 and an adjusted basis of $100. US1 also owns the following business assets that will generate ordinary income (or loss) upon disposition: Asset D, which has a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $40; Asset E, which has a fair market value of $60 and an adjusted basis of $100; and, Asset F, which has a fair market value of $40 and an adjusted basis of $80. US1 liquidates into F and distributes all assets to F in liquidation. None of the assets qualify for nonrecognition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. US1's total realized capital loss is $80, but it may only recognize $60 of that loss. See section 1211(a). US1's total realized ordinary loss is $80, but it may only recognize $60 of that loss. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section. US1 will allocate $15 (60 X .25) of the recognized capital loss to Asset B and will allocate the remaining $45 (60 X .75) of recognized capital loss to Asset C. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section. US1 will allocate $30 (60 X .50) of the recognized ordinary loss to Asset E and will allocate the remaining $30 (60 X .50) to Asset F. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rules for built-in gains and losses attributable to property received in liquidations and reorganizations. Built-in losses attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not offset gain from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gains attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not be offset by a loss from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gain or loss is that amount of gain or loss on property that existed at the time the domestic liquidating corporation acquired such property. See sections 336(d) and 382 for additional limitations on the recognition of losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distribution of partnership interest--(A) General rule. If a domestic corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic) in a distribution described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, then for purposes of applying this section the domestic liquidating corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property. Accordingly, the applicability of the recognition rules of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, and of any exception to recognition provided in this section shall be determined with reference to the partnership property, rather than to the partnership interest itself. Where the partnership property includes an interest in a lower-tier partnership, the applicability of any exception with respect to the interest in the lower-tier partnership shall be determined with reference to the lower-tier partnership property. In the case of multiple tiers of partnerships, the applicability of an exception shall be determined with reference to the property of each partnership, applying the rule contained in the preceding

sentence. A domestic liquidating corporation's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. If a domestic corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic) in a distribution described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, then for purposes of applying this section the domestic liquidating corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property. Accordingly, the applicability of the recognition rules of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, and of any exception to recognition provided in this section shall be determined with reference to the partnership property, rather than to the partnership interest itself. Where the partnership property includes an interest in a lower-tier partnership, the applicability of any exception with respect to the interest in the lower-tier partnership shall be determined with reference to the lower-tier partnership property. In the case of multiple tiers of partnerships, the applicability of an exception shall be determined with reference to the property of each partnership, applying the rule contained in the preceding

sentence. A domestic liquidating corporation's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gain or loss calculation. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Basis adjustments. The foreign distributee corporation's basis in the distributed partnership interest shall be equal to the domestic liquidating corporation's basis in such partnership interest immediately prior to the distribution, increased by the amount of gain and reduced by the amount of loss recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation on the distribution of the partnership interest. Solely for purposes of sections 743 and 754, the foreign distributee corporation shall be treated as having purchased the partnership interest for an amount equal to the foreign corporation's adjusted basis therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Publicly traded partnerships. The distribution by a domestic liquidating corporation of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes under section 7704(a) shall not be subject to the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Instead, the distribution of such an interest shall be treated in the same manner as a distribution of stock. Thus, a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a domestic corporation, and a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--(i) Distribution of property used in a U.S. trade or business--(A) Conditions for nonrecognition.

A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain or loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on its distribution of property (including inventory) used by the domestic liquidating corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within United States, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The foreign distributee corporation, immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the date of the distribution of such property, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The domestic liquidating corporation attaches the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the taxable years that include the distributions in liquidation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The foreign distributee corporation attaches a copy of the property description contained in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(2) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the tax year that includes the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Qualifying property. Property is used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) only if all income from the use of the property and all income or gain from the sale or exchange of the property would be subject to taxation under section 882(a) as effectively connected income. Also, stock held by a dealer as inventory or for sale in the ordinary course of its trade or business shall be treated as inventory and not as stock in the hands of both the domestic liquidating corporation and the distributee foreign corporation.

Whether a failure to file or failure to comply was willful will be determined by the Director (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) based on all the facts and circumstances. The taxpayer must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Although a taxpayer whose failure to file or failure to comply is determined not to be willful will not be subject to gain or loss recognition under this section, the taxpayer will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if the taxpayer fails to satisfy the reporting requirements, if any, under that section and does not demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See Sec. 1.6038B-1(e)(4) and (f).

A taxpayer's statement that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the taxpayer becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the

gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on the assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the later of: the date provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(5), taking into account paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) and (D), as applicable (date one); or, the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director (date two). However, the taxpayer is not required to file a Form 8838 with the amended return if both date one is later than date two and a Form 8838 was previously filed extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to date one. If a Form 8838 is not required to be filed pursuant to the previous sentence, a copy of the previously filed Form 8838 must be filed with the amended return. The amended return and either a Form 8838 or a copy of the previously filed Form 8838, as the case may be, must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the taxpayer filed its original return. The taxpayer may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission.
