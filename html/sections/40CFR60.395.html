If no such instances have occurred  during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to  the Administrator semiannually.

In addition, every three-hour period shall be reported each quarter  during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed  when the coating system is operational is less than 80 percent of the  average temperature difference of the device during the most recent  control device performance test at which destruction efficiency was  determined as specified under Sec. 60.393.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For thermal and catalytic incinerators, if no such periods  occur, the owner or operator shall submit a negative report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 30 days in  advance of any test by Method 25.
