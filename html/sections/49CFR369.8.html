                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section governs requests for exemptions from  filing of the report required under Sec. 369.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  (FMCSA) may grant a request upon a proper showing that the exemption is  necessary to preserve confidential business information that is not  otherwise publicly available. Information is considered to be  confidential when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of the information in the carrier's report would be  likely to cause substantial harm to the carrier's competitive position;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure of information in the report would be likely to  impair protectable government interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. A carrier's request may include any other grounds as to  why the request should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. For Annual Form M, both  the report and the request are due by March 31 of the year following the  year to which it relates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Decision to grant or deny a request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request will be  denied if it fails to provide all of the supporting information required  in paragraph (c) of this section or if the supporting information is  insufficient to establish that information in the carrier's report meets  the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FMCSA will grant or deny each request within a reasonable period  of time. FMCSA will notify the carrier of its decision. The decision by  FMCSA shall be administratively final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pendency. While a request is pending, the carrier is required to  submit any reports required under Sec. 369.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Period of exemptions. If a request for an exemption under this  section is granted, the carrier will be exempt from the reporting  requirements of Sec. 369.1 for a period of three reporting years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modification of a decision to grant a request. If a request is  granted it remains in effect in accordance with its terms, unless  modified by a later finding that the decision was clearly erroneous. If  FMCSA believes such a finding should be made, FMCSA will notify the  requesting carrier in writing of the reasons for the modification. The  carrier may seek reconsideration of the modification.
