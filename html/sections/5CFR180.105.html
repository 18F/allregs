Claims based upon assignment of a claim by a proper claimant are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conditional vendor claims. Claims asserted by or on behalf of a conditional vendor are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claims by improper claimants. Claims by persons not designated in Sec. 180.102(a) are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Small items of substantial value. Claims are not payable for money or for small articles of substantial value, such as watches or expensive jewelry, when shipped with household goods or as unaccompanied baggage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Articles of extraordinary value. Claims are not payable for expensive articles of gold, silver, other precious metals, paintings, antiques other than bulky furnishings, relics, and other articles of extraordinary value when shipped with household goods by ordinary means or as unaccompanied baggage at normal released valuation. Claims for such articles are payable when their loss is incident to shipment by expedited mode in accordance with current joint travel regulations. This prohibition does not apply to articles in the personal custody of the claimant or articles properly checked, provided that reasonable protection or security

measures have been taken by the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Articles acquired for other persons. Claims are not payable for articles intended directly or indirectly for persons other than the claimant or members of the claimant's immediate household. This prohibition includes articles acquired at the request of others and articles for sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Property used for business.

When investigation discloses that a claimant, claimant's agent, claimant's employee, or member of claimant's family has intentionally misrepresented an item claimed as to cost, condition, cost to repair, etc., the item will be disallowed in its entirety even though some actual damage has been sustained. However, if the remainder of the claim is proper it will be paid. This does not preclude appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.</p>
