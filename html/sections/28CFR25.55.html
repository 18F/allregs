                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By no later than March 31, 2009, and on a monthly basis as  designated by the operator, any individual or entity acting as an  insurance carrier conducting business within the United States shall  provide, or cause to be provided on its behalf, to the operator and in a  format acceptable to the operator, a report that contains an inventory  of all automobiles of the current model year or any of the four prior  model years that the carrier, during the past month, has obtained  possession of and has decided are junk automobiles or salvage  automobiles. An insurance carrier shall report on any automobiles that  it has determined to be a total loss under the law of the applicable  jurisdiction (i.e. , state) or designated as a total loss by the  insurance company under the terms of its policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The inventory must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and contact information for the reporting  entity (insurance carrier);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> VIN;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date on which the automobile was obtained or designated as a  junk or salvage automobile;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name of the individual or entity from whom the automobile  was obtained and who possessed it when the automobile was designated as  a junk or salvage automobile; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The name of the owner of the automobile at the time of the  filing of the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Insurance carriers are strongly encouraged to provide the  operator with information on other motor vehicles or other information  relevant to a motor vehicle's title, including the reason why the  insurance carrier obtained possession of the motor vehicle. For example,  the insurance carrier may have obtained possession of a motor vehicle  because it had been subject to flood, water, collision, or fire damage,  or as a   result of theft and recovery. The provision of information provided by  an insurance carrier under this paragraph must be pursuant to a means  approved by the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insurance carriers whose required data is provided to the  operator through an operator-authorized third party in a manner  acceptable to the operator are not required to duplicate such reporting.  For example, if the operator and a private third-party organization  reach agreement on the provision of insurance data already reported by  insurance to the third party, insurance companies are not required to  subsequently report the information directly into NMVTIS.</p>
